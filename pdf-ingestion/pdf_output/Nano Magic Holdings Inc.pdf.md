PART I
Item 1. Business
Nano Magic Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Nano Magic” or the “Company”), formerly Nano Magic Inc., develops,
commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products powered by nanotechnology. Our nanotechnology powered solutions are formulated
in the Unites States. We are recognized for the products manufactured and sold by our wholly-owned subsidiary Nano Magic LLC (formerly PEN
Brands LLC). These include the NANO MAGIC and ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner. Our consumer products include electronic device
hygiene & protection, anti-fog solutions, household cleaning and automobile cleaning and protection in addition to lens care. Our focus for
consumer products is to sell Nano Magic-branded consumer products in big box retail and direct-to-consumer sales on our website and other on-
line marketplaces. We historically sold our consumer products directly to opticians, ophthalmologists and small optical retailers and we will
continue to do so. Institutional and industrial applications include cleaning and defogging and other coatings for glass and ceramics. We also
develop and sell printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows through our other wholly-owned
subsidiary, Applied Nanotech, Inc. (“Applied Nanotech”). Applied Nanotech also functions as our Innovation and Technology Center in Austin,
Texas, and, in addition to performing product development work for our business, engages in contract research and development work for
government and private customers.
Our principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities. Our two reportable segments for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract Services segment.
Product Segment
In our Product segment, revenue is based on the retail and institutional sale of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique
performance attributes. We have a strong focus on understanding surfaces and our products for surfaces can be used on a wide variety of
substrates. Our consumer products are sold as liquids, gels, foam and as wet and dry towelettes. Institutional coating products are typically sold in
liquid form enabling application by a variety of common commercial techniques We rely on intellectual property including trade secret formulations
to protect our proprietary technology.
We have multiple product technology platforms that offer solutions to common surface problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging,
preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear and surface protection. All our products have some “nano”
characteristic about them – whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-
assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness.
Our consumer products are primarily customized cleaning and protection solutions. With respect to our consumer products, we strive to create
segment leading brands for solutions that are sustainable, of high quality, and that are both easy and safe to apply. Recently we introduced a new
product that combines antifog and cleaning into one for convenience for our users. This, and other products can be used on eyeglasses, safety
goggles and glasses, extreme sport glasses, goggles and visors. Our solutions are also packaged for use on electronic screens, windows, mirrors,
shower doors, and other similar clear surfaces along with the cleaning of everyday household surfaces. We have also expanded into the auto care
sector with Force Field® windshield protection. This product creates a non-stick, super water repellent protective barrier — like a force field — to
protect the windshield against rain, bugs, and salt. The coating solution is easy-to-apply and improves visibility and safety while driving.
Industrial surface treatment products include a family of coating liquids that create nano-thin, strongly-bound, invisible, “forcefield”-like coatings
on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surfaces and a series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron sized particles to improve
abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology
and strive to maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace.
4

Our surface treating products include:
● Liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for cleaning and protecting clear surfaces – such as electronic
touchscreens, windshields, windows, mirrors, shower doors, eyeglass and sunglass lenses.
● Liquid formulation packaged for retail and industrial sale for cleaning surfaces.
● Anti-fogging liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including face
shields, and sporting goggles.
● Anti-fogging towelettes for sale to the military and first responders for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and
other applications such as head’s up displays,
● Mar-resistant and stain-resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as restaurants,
cruise ships, casinos.
● Clear protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include automotive
and hand-held devices.
● Protective and water-repelling coatings on interior and exterior glass and ceramic surfaces to make it easy to clean and prevent scale and
grime encrustation.
● Coatings for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces
to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses.
In addition to our surface treatment products, we sell metallic inks and pastes to a variety of customers around the world. The submicron particles
in our formulations are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing, including 3D printing. Certain products based on nano-copper are
available only outside Asia under agreements with our former research partner Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., that has exclusive rights in Asia
to patents developed under research contracts with them. Other copper products that we sell are available worldwide.
In the medical field, our thin carbon foil made of layers of graphene is sold for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals
used by the medical field in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.
Our vision is to harness the power of nanotechnology to create a safer, more socially conscious, and higher performing world. We have three
primary areas of focus:
1. Surface cleaning for safety, time and cost savings: Treating surfaces at the nano-scale for easy clean performance – to clean better and to
stay cleaner longer;
2. Preventing fogging: Surface treatments at the nano-scale to prevent fogging for safety and improved performance, especially on lenses,
sportwear and protective eyewear; and
3. Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods while avoiding the use
of harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible.

Marketing and Distribution
We sell our Nano Magic branded consumer products directly to consumers and retailers in the United States and through a distributor in Canada.
Direct-to-consumer sales are through our website, nanomagic.com, on Amazon and other online marketplaces. We also have products in
pharmacies, and big box retailers. Sales to big box retailers also include private label products under the retailers’ names. Some of our products
are incorporated into our customer’s branded products. We continue direct sales to opticians and ophthalmologists.
Our industrial coating products, inks and pastes, and graphene foil products are sold directly to institutional and industrial customers.
Manufacturing Operations
We manufacture, pack and label liquids and towelettes as well as specialty surface coatings at our 29,220-square foot facility in Madison Heights,
Michigan. Metallic inks and pastes and the graphene windows are made at our Innovation and Technology Center in Austin, Texas. Health and
safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic are in effect at our facilities, but both our facilities are operating.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our nanotechnology expertise and the related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science,
molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, surfactants, sub-micron metallic inks and pastes and graphene foils. The intellectual property
developed from this work is protected with a combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is
like that used by leading companies in the fragrance and flavors industry. No single patent is significant to any of our commercial products. Please
refer to the section entitled “Intellectual Property Rights” in this Item 1 for a more detailed discussion of these matters.
Competition
Products sold into the optical segment, which has historically been our core sales channel, have a small number of significant competitors. Our
products are known to be the “benchmark” products in these segments and generally outperform those of our competitors. Some of our products in
these segments do compete for certain customers or certain applications against lower-priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling
products into these market segments are privately-held U.S. packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. include Hilco Accessories,
California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories. Internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China is a
competitor. These companies are not selling direct to consumer or in big box retail and pharmacies. Optical company, Carl Zeiss, sells its branded
optical products in big box retail in those chains where it has optical stores.
In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product line we are not aware of any competitive products that we believe match our product
performance or processing characteristics. With the COVID-19 pandemic and fogging caused by increased use of masks, other companies have
made more of an effort to sell anti-fog products and there were new entrants into this market, but no company has a significant portion of the
market.
Most inks and pastes sold in commercial quantities today are manufactured and sold by large multinational chemical companies. For example, the
two largest suppliers of silver inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro. We are unable to compete directly with companies of
that size in established silver ink markets. The use of metallic inks in 2D and 3D printing is just developing. Because silver is expensive, other
metals are preferred for these applications. Numerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive
inks and pastes.

Backlog
Sales are primarily made under purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any date is indicative of future
results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified period, but these agreements do
not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. Private label customers are required to commit either to minimums or to repurchase
unique inventory items related to their product(s). The quantities purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently
revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer’s delay of a product
shipment can make a difference in the results for an accounting period.
Geographical Information
All long-lived assets are in the United States.
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
We use third-party suppliers in the United States to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging products. As is customary in
our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers and have generally made purchases through
purchase orders. In the last quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 we terminated most of our outside contract and toll manufacturing, bringing
our manufacturing back in house. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers.
Apart from the disruption affecting all manufacturing businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the raw materials and bottles used
to produce our liquid products are used to produce hand sanitizer and other cleaning product that were in high demand during the pandemic and
some of our raw materials and packaging became harder to find due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we were able to obtain what we needed for our
operations. With some suppliers we have moved to blanket purchase orders and have seen some price increases, but this has not disrupted
operations.
Key Customers
A limited number of key customers historically accounted for a majority of our revenue in the Product segment. The company re-built its customer
base in 2021 and 2020 with the addition of new sales channels. In 2021 four customers represented 52% of Product revenue, and in 2020, two
customers represented 21% of Product revenue. A limited number of customers constitute substantially all of our Contract services segment. In
2021, two customers provided 100% of revenue in the Contract services segment and, in 2020, three customers represented 92% of revenue in that
segment.
Impact of COVID-19
In December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
declared COVID-19 a pandemic. During the rest of 2020, restrictions imposed by Federal, state and local governments affected operations of our
business and those of our vendors and customers as well as logistics for shipping and receiving supplies and shipping our products. We experienced
longer lead-times to receive supplies and price increases on some items, but did not suffer any major disruption and these changes have been
incorporated into our operating procedures and business.
The increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as a result of the pandemic created additional demand for our antifog
product. Whether this will continue as government restrictions are lifted and COVID-19 related recommendations for mask wearing become less
restrictive is unknown.
Whether the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses and our customers generally, and on our business in particular, will continue, and how
this will change with changes in government restrictions over time, or from other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.

Contract Services Segment
Our Contract services segment functions as the Innovation and Technology Center for our new products as well as performing work for government
agencies and private strategic partners. Formerly called the research and development segment, this segment has moved away from areas of
research that do not involve product development, especially government contracts that required us to fund part of the research cost. This segment
is involved in development work under contract for government and private entities. The Center is also a resource for proof of concepts and
prototypes for proposed Nano Magic products. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:
● Printed sensors;
● Printed electronics; and
● Submicron particle formulations and materials for health and safety products.
Much of our contract product development work is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done.
With private development contracts, there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under
the contract. Our short-term goal when we work for others is to cover all out-of-pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead. Our long-term
goal is to become a trusted supplier of products to our development partners.
Nanoelectronics Applications – Inks and Pastes
Metallic Inks & Pastes
Copper Inks - New digital and additive manufacturing processes allow industries to move from the design process directly to the production line.
We believe that only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible with the nozzles used in digital printing.
Other metallic inks – Our technology and development work in conductive inks also resulted in inks and pastes using nickel, copper-nickel alloy,
silver, indium, and aluminum. Research partners who funded some of our work using silver and aluminum have exclusive rights to certain products
for solar applications. We are not restricted in using products for other applications, and we can sell into the solar field our products that do not
infringe those specific patents.
These different inks can be used in printed electronics as well as printed sensors.
Technical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS)
Conductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution
for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have
also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for
companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes. In addition to traditional 2D printing applications, we developed
multifunctional inks for 3D printing applications, the fastest growing segment of printed electronics.
We also build on our expertise in inks and pastes to work with potential customers to develop inks to their specifications for their products in
development. Product sales typically come from repeat business or from customer inquiries in our areas of expertise.
Sensors
Our approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. Our
competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas
where we are currently active are described below.
Hydrogen and Methane Sensors. Hydrogen sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large
power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. Currently, we are
not aware of commercial interest in hydrogen sensors.
8

Methane gas detectors that we developed for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association have achieved UL
1484 certification for Residential Gas Detectors. In 2018, the Northeast Gas Association completed a field test and reliability study of these sensors.
The results have led to further work to improve the performance of these detectors beyond the UL 1484 standards. Northeast Gas Association has
told us that they have a commercialization partner. Following that, in 2020 we reached agreement with the Northeast Gas Association to license to
our background intellectual property pursuant to which we will be entitled to a percentage of revenue from any commercial sales through March
31, 2028. It is our understanding that the Northeast Gas Association is not presently working to commercialize its sensor technology.
Submicron Particle Formulations and Materials for Health and Safety Applications
Using our experience with metallic inks and our prior work with carbon nanotube composites we developed a new graphene foil that is used by
institutional customers who make nuclear pharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications. We have developed mountings for the foil and have
developed foils that include both carbon nanotubes and graphene for longer life in cyclotron applications. We have built on this experience to
develop targets to be used by customers in this industry.
Related to the Company’s contract services revenue, three customers accounted for 100% and 92% of contract services revenue in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. All three of those customers were government entities in 2021 and 2020.
Intellectual Property Rights
An important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and, when appropriate, we seek
patent protection for our products and proprietary technology. Trade secret protection is most important to our products. Our patent portfolio
consists of approximately a dozen issued patents.
The patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards
change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different
jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance what scope of protection any issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will
be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a legal challenge. The costs of such proceedings would be significant and an
unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings.
If we fail to obtain patents or elect not to file for patent protection, there can be no assurance that we can protect our rights in the technology, or
that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our
technology.
Competitors have filed applications for, or have been issued, patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products
or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to
which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is
unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and
expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, we could potentially challenge the validity of the other patent but would need to
overcome a presumption of validity. If we were found to infringe and the patent was held valid (or was unchallenged), there could be no assurance
that the prevailing party would grant us a license. Even if a license were available, the payments that would be required would be unknown and
could materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products.
We require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute
confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all
confidential information developed or made known to the individual through the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third
parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by
the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection
for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
9

Government Contracts
A portion of our revenue in the Contract services segment consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. Our
revenue from government contracts was $376,105 and $683,422 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These
reimbursements represented all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had one government
contract in process that had approximately $90,762 of potential revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk
of cancellation. Also, in the ordinary course of business, government contractors generally are subject to audits and reviews by government
agencies. These audits and reviews involve review of a contractor’s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs incurred
and compliance with all laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and we do not expect
the results of any government audit to have a significant effect on our operations or our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and development drive our new products and improvement of existing products. Research and development costs incurred in the
development of the Company’s products was $34,875 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Research and development costs were $56,816 for
2020. This represented approximately 0.9% and 2.2% of our total operating costs in each of those years. The ability to engineer product
performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Product research and
development work includes branding and packaging, development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied
both by hand and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing
processes and techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer’s use of the product.
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Our operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (“OSHA”), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other state and local regulations,
including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. We take these requirements into account in product
development. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future.
OSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and
foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with
these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our
customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can
affect timing of sales which may be significant in an accounting period.
Our commercial products do not require any government approvals.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 35 full-time employees. Our employees are valued team members and are important to our growth and success.
This is especially true given our relatively small size. By cross-training so that individuals can master a number of different tasks, we try to create a
more challenging work environment and minimize disruption in the case of absence or employee departures. We strive to provide a positive work
environment emphasizing a positive attitude, team work and ethical behavior. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we
consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
COVID-19 has disrupted the global economy and Nano Magic’s supply chain and the long-term effects of the pandemic cannot be
predicted.
The COVID-19 pandemic and government orders imposed restrictions and disrupted the U.S. and global economies. The duration of the disruption
and the short and long-term effects of new and changing requirements and new consumer and business behaviors are impossible to predict.
Nano Magic experienced increased demand for its anti-fog product as a result of the pandemic. It is unknown whether demand will remain high
once the effects of the pandemic are blunted by the availability of new vaccines. Similarly, the staying power of new entrants who took advantage of
the demand is unknown.
The long-term effect of the pandemic on the supply chain, raw materials supply and pricing, the distribution of Nano Magic products, and changes
in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic experience cannot be foreseen.
Supply chain disruption and sales growth can put additional strain on our need for working capital.
Disruption in the supply chain from COVID-19 has caused us to see some higher prices and longer lead times. To assure supply, Nano Magic must
order materials with longer lead times, increasing the time between its down payments to vendors and the time when Nano Magic can realize a
sale. Increased order volume and increased sales require that Nano Magic buy larger quantities of raw material inventory and packaging materials.
Sales growth also increases its need for working capital, as Nano Magic must pay for the materials before it can see the increased revenue from
customers. Similarly, labor must be paid for before the revenue is realized. This can create a greater need for growth capital when funds are
already curtailed by Nano Magic’s operating losses.
Nano Magic has limited resources which can hamper its ability to execute its business plan.
Nano Magic is a small company with limited human and financial resources. This limits the resources Nano Magic can devote to the sale and
promotion of its products, and may limit its ability to tackle issues that arise in manufacturing and distribution. Nano Magic’s size curtails the
resources Nano Magic can devote to promoting its existing products and developing brand recognition. Nano Magic’s limited resources can
constrain its ability to take advantage of opportunities, may limit its growth and may give competitors time to challenge its products in the
marketplace. These factors will make it harder for Nano Magic to be successful.
Nano Magic is dependent on key executives and loss of its President and CEO or other key personnel could adversely affect its results
of operations and financial condition.
Nano Magic’s President and CEO, Tom Berman, is under contract through the end of 2023. His vision and leadership are very important to the
execution of the Nano Magic business plan, and loss of his services would adversely affect Nano Magic’s results of operations and the value of its
stock. Other executives and employees are at-will employees, so they may terminate their employment relationship at any time. Loss of experienced
personnel and their knowledge of Nano Magic’s business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Moreover, because of Nano Magic’s
small size, it would be very difficult for remaining personnel to perform the duties fulfilled by the loss of personnel.
Increased sales under the Nano Magic brand name and building a strong brand with consumer brand loyalty will take time.
Nano Magic has placed a number of Nano Magic branded products in pharmacies and big box retailers. Developing customer loyalty and brand
awareness takes time. The time frame could be shortened if Nano Magic had greater resources for marketing and advertising.
Consumer confidence and spending habits have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but what that means and how this will affect sales of
Nano Magic products remains unknown.

Nano Magic is a small company and the marketplace for consumer cleaning products is competitive.
Nano Magic has a limited line of products; retail chains and big-box stores may only want suppliers that offer a more extensive product line. Nano
Magic has fewer resources than many of its competitors to devote to extending product lines, and to new products and packaging. Its inability to
devote the required resources to adapt to the demands of consumers or to meet competitive product offerings may limit Nano Magic’s ability to
execute on its business plan and hurt its revenue.
If we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach, data loss or other compromise, including if unauthorized
access to our data, our business operations may be interrupted, our reputation and business relationships may be harmed, and we
may incur other costs.
We use cloud-based computer systems for our communications (e-mail, voice, data exchange, etc.), for other aspects of our operations and for our
business and financial records. Any security breach, data loss, or other compromise, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing
attack, or any unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in the loss or destruction of or
unauthorized access to, or use, alteration, disclosure, or acquisition of, data, business disruptions and delays as well as damage to our reputation,
litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Our website and technology infrastructure also may experience performance issues due to a
variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural
disasters, or fraud.
We also rely on cloud technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management
services, relationship management services, and aspects of our manufacturing and sales functions. If our service agreements are terminated, or
there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to our
providers’ facilities, we could experience business interruptions as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new
facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud-based offerings for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our vendors and service providers may also be the targets of
cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and fraud. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, including
our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
Our facilities, as well as the facilities of third-parties that provide or maintain, or have access to our data or network infrastructure, are vulnerable
to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications
failures and similar events. In the event that our or any third-party provider’s systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events
discussed above, our ability to operate may be impaired. A third party’s decision to close facilities or terminate services without adequate notice, or
other unanticipated problems, could adversely impact our operations. If business continuity and disaster recovery plans of ours or of a third-party
provider prove to be inadequate in preventing the loss of data or service interruptions, this could cause further disruptions to our operations or
damages to important systems or facilities or damage to our computer hardware or systems or those of our employees, or customers. Our systems
have been the target of cyber-attacks. Although we have taken and continue to take steps to enhance our cybersecurity posture, we cannot assure
that future cyber incidents will not occur or that our systems will not be targeted or breached in the future.
Drug stores and big-box retail chains that Nano Magic has targeted as a distribution channel to increase its sales volume have their
own specific product requirements and demand a high level of support from vendors which will be challenging for Nano Magic, due to
its size and limited resources.
To supply a large number of stores and maintain their brand quality, drug stores and big-box retail chains often require, among other things, that
their vendors comply with scheduling and packaging requirements, maintain back-up inventory in reserves and impose other standards and
restrictions on their vendors. If Nano Magic, because of its limited resources, cannot meet these requirements, then it will not be able to service
these distribution channels, and Nano Magic’s potential for revenue growth will be harmed. Moreover, losing a customer may leave Nano Magic
with significant obsolete inventory.
12

Sales of specialized coatings to industrial customers that incorporate Nano Magic products into their own product offerings make us
dependent on Nano Magic’s industrial customers’ commitment to the product and dependent on the success of Nano Magic’s
customers.
Some of Nano Magic’s existing products are sold to institutional customers that incorporate Nano Magic’s product into their own product or service
offering to their customers. This means the success of Nano Magic’s product is dependent on the level of support, marketing and customer
assistance provided by the institutional customers. Also, Nano Magic cannot control timing, marketing or introduction of its products or improved
products, the timing or methods used to address customer concerns, and Nano Magic cannot affect directly marketing or distribution of the
products or services that incorporate its products. If Nano Magic’s industrial customer has other priorities or is unsuccessful in its marketing or
provides poor customer service, then the sales of Nano Magic’s products and Nano Magic’s results of operations will be adversely affected. To the
extent that Nano Magic’s customers feel the effects of an economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic, that may lessen their interest in
introducing products or services incorporating Nano Magic products.
Revenue in the contract research segment is dependent on government funding for technology development that is subject to a
number of risks that could adversely impact Nano Magic.
Research contracts funded by the U.S. government are awarded through multiple agencies. Agency priorities and focus can change over time, and
government funding overall is affected by political considerations affecting priorities and budgets. Government funding and priorities will also be
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of Nano Magic’s projects originate with the SBIR program. The initial grant is small, but if Nano Magic
establishes proof of concept, then it will be eligible for larger, follow-on grants. However, eligibility for such additional grants also require approval
and grant award funding. If funding priorities change, then new grants may not be made in areas that are a focus for Nano Magic’s research, and
Nano Magic may need to refocus its funding proposals or apply to different agencies. Moreover, some parts of most projects are the responsibility
of subcontractors, and a failure of performance by a subcontractor may adversely affect performance under the contract and may affect follow-on
funding or Nano Magic’s reputation as a government contractor or subcontractor. Failure to receive awards of new research funding will adversely
affect revenue and margin in Nano Magic’s Contract research segment.
Risks relating to the Introduction of New Products
Other cleaning product companies are much larger, with more money for advertising and marketing and staff dedicated to regulatory
regimes related to selling disinfectants into the consumer market.
Nano Magic is working to accomplish a commercial launch of a new cleaning product based on its patented technology. Other Nano Magic products
have not been subject to regulations administered by the EPA. Compliance with EPA requirements may involve significant product testing and
qualification — and take time and money — and new and changed regulations require monitoring on an ongoing basis. In addition, other
government regulations apply to consumer sales. Nano Magic does not presently have staff responsible for regulatory approvals and compliance
and will need to build that capacity or hire outside consultants. How this will impact time to commercial launch and the cost of compliance, both to
accomplish launch and on an ongoing basis, are unknown.
Sales to new industrial or institutional customers typically have a long-lead time, as much as two years between customer interest
and the first commercial sale, which makes it difficult to capitalize on opportunities and limits Nano Magic’s ability to grow revenue.
To become a supplier to a new institutional customer Nano Magic must complete the customer’s internal approval process and be set up as a new
vendor. This process is outside of Nano Magic’s control and puts a strain on its limited resources. When the product is a coating product, Nano
Magic’s technology may need to be incorporated into the customer’s manufacturing or the production processes of its customers. This can require
an initial small-scale pilot project before the process with Nano Magic’s coating or technology is expanded to full-scale commercial production. If
that occurs, even if no problems are encountered, then commercial sales will be delayed, and Nano Magic must allocate the technical resources to
support the customer as it scales-up production. The time and resources required make the effort more risky for Nano Magic, as the customer
could stop the project at any point. The process also requires a significant commitment from the customer, and recognizing the limits of Nano
Magic’s resources, potential customers may choose not to work with a small supplier.
13

Nano Magic has limited resources which could hamper its ability to launch new products.
Nano Magic’s small size and limited resources reduce the number of potential new product ideas that Nano Magic can pursue and the number of
potential products that Nano Magic works on at any time. These constraints can also limit Nano Magic’s ability to bring new product ideas through
development stage and commercial-scale manufacturing. Its limited resources can inhibit Nano Magic’s ability to take advantage of opportunities,
and may give competitors time to challenge its products in the marketplace. These factors may hinder Nano Magic’s ability to expand its product
line and grow its revenue.
Some of Nano Magic’s technology development is in its early stages and the viability of commercial products is unknown.
Some applications of Nano Magic’s intellectual property, and certain products that use these technologies, will require significant additional
development, engineering, testing and investment prior to commercialization. Unknowns include: whether commercially viable products can be
developed; the size of the potential customer base; the resources required to develop, test, standardize, manufacture, market, distribute and sell
these potential products. Evaluating the potential of a product under development is a matter of judgment, and errors in judgment relating to
products Nano Magic is developing would reduce the resources available for other potential products and delay commercialization which would
adversely affect Nano Magic’s results of operations and may require Nano Magic to seek additional capital that may not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all.
Risks Relating to Nano Magic’s Technology and Commercialization
Nano Magic’s strategy to commercialize new products from its intellectual property may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming
than expected, any of which could adversely affect Nano Magic’s results and negatively affect the value of its common stock.
Though few companies have successfully developed commercial products based on nanotechnology, Nano Magic plans to create new products
using its intellectual property. To implement this plan, Nano Magic must identify product opportunities, take the products from concept to
prototype, and make and sell the new product commercially. Many factors affect a customer’s acceptance of new products and many new product
ideas are never realized. Many others never achieve commercial success. If Nano Magic cannot successfully develop and sell products enhanced by
nanotechnology, or if the process drags on, then the value of Nano Magic’s common stock may continue to be adversely affected.
Nano Magic’s products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may subject it to claims, or prevent or delay its
product development efforts and stop it from selling or increase the costs of its products.
Nano Magic’s commercial success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of
third parties. If claims are made that Nano Magic is using third party technology without authorization or that any third-party patents cover Nano
Magic’s products or their use, then the holders of any of these patents or other intellectual property may be able to block the sale of Nano Magic’s
products unless Nano Magic obtains a license or changes the products so as not to use the third-party’s intellectual property. Nano Magic could
incur significant costs defending against any claim; and, if Nano Magic is liable, then Nano Magic may not be able to enter licensing arrangements
or to redesign the products at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.
Nano Magic may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.
Nano Magic relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary know-how and technology, especially where Nano Magic does not believe patent
protection is appropriate or obtainable. Others independently may develop the same or similar technology, or otherwise obtain access to Nano
Magic’s proprietary technology. Nano Magic relies in part on confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants to protect its trade
secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide
an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the
scope of Nano Magic’s proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use Nano Magic’s
proprietary information and to develop products that better compete with its products.
14

Any lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend Nano Magic or enforce its rights will be
costly and time consuming.
Nano Magic’s ability to defend its intellectual property may require litigation to enforce its rights or to defend litigation brought by a third-party.
Any of these lawsuits, regardless of their success, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and may require delay or
suspension of commercial sales while they are pending. The cost could cause Nano Magic to forego litigation or to settle on terms that are
disadvantageous. If litigation is undertaken or defended, that attendant cost or delay could have a material, adverse impact on Nano Magic’s
results of operations.
Some health effects of nanotechnology are unknown.
There has been scientific debate on the health effects of nanomaterials. The science of nanotechnology is engineering at the molecular level to
modify or build materials. Many nano-materials are found in nature; others are not naturally occurring. Some scientists believe that certain
nanomaterials may be hazardous to human health or the environment. The health effect of new materials is unknown, and can be affected by how
they are incorporated and bonded to other materials. Nano Magic focuses on materials larger than 100 nanometers so that they are not regulated
as nanoparticles, and Nano Magic carefully evaluates potential health effects of its products on its customers and the effects of handling materials
on Nano Magic’s employees. Nano Magic is very mindful of the risks of materials Nano Magic uses and focuses on health and safety. However,
debate about the health effects of nanoparticles and nanotechnology may adversely affect market acceptance of Nano Magic’s products and
adversely affect its financial performance.
Risks Related to Ownership of Nano Magic’s Common Stock
Nano Magic common stock has not resumed trading on the OCTQB since the SEC issued an order suspending trading for a period of
10 days. Very few companies resume trading following a trading suspension, and failure of Nano Magic stock to resume trading will
likely depress Nano Magic’s stock price and will also make it more difficult to sell Nano Magic stock.
On April 30, 2020, the Commission issued an Order of Suspension of Trading (the “Order”) with respect to Nano Magic’s Common Stock. The
trading suspension associated with the Order expired after ten (10) business days, at 11:59 PM on Thursday, May 14, 2020. Nano Magic has not
resumed trading on the OTCQB since entry of the trading suspension and the resumption of trading eligibility. One effect of the Order is Nano
Magic lost eligibility for the “piggyback exception” under Rule 15c2-11(f)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Even if the Commission were to
rule in favor of Nano Magic and restore the “piggyback exception,” then there still is no assurance that a broker-dealer will resume publishing
quotations for Nano Magic.
Concentration of stock ownership with affiliates could make a management change or an acquisition of Nano Magic more difficult.
Approximately 84% of the outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by Nano Magic’s present officers and directors. Certain provisions of
Nano Magic’s organizational documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the
price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of Nano Magic’s common stock. For example, the amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws will:
● authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by Nano Magic’s board of directors without prior stockholder
approval, commonly referred to as “blank check” preferred stock, with rights senior to those of its common stock;
● limit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;
● permit written action by voting stockholders, permitting affiliates acting alone to accomplish most stockholder actions;
● establish advance notice requirements to nominate persons for election to Nano Magic’s board of directors or to propose matters that can
be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
● not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and
● provide for the filling of vacancies on Nano Magic’s Board of Directors by action of a majority of the directors and not by the stockholders.
These provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of Nano Magic common stock.
15

Nano Magic’s common stock is thinly traded, and the number of free trading shares is small, thereby contributing to price volatility.
Even before the trading suspension (described above), there was little trading of Nano Magic common stock. At present, Nano Magic stock trades
in the grey market. As a result, an investor may not be able to sell Nano Magic common stock at the time that the investor would like to sell.
Furthermore, if a stock is thinly traded, then any sale may depress the market price.
The limited number of Nano Magic’s free trading shares may limit its ability to raise capital through private placements forcing Nano
Magic to offer its stock using more costly qualification or registration procedures.
To remain eligible for the OTCQB, Nano Magic must have a minimum float of 10% of the outstanding stock. Shares sold in a private placement are
restricted, and issuing too many restricted shares will take Nano Magic below the float required to remain on the OTCQB. This may force Nano
Magic to use available qualification and registration procedures for any capital raise. This in turn would require additional time and resources
before Nano Magic would have additional funds for operations or other purposes.
The market price of Nano Magic’s common stock is subject to potential significant price fluctuation because the common stock is
thinly traded, and that could result in substantial losses for investors and subject Nano Magic to securities class action litigation.
Among the factors that may cause the market price of Nano Magic’s common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this “Risk Factors”
section and other factors, including:
● The trading volume of Nano Magic’s common stock;
● Changes in Nano Magic’s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;
● Actual or expected sales of Nano Magic’s common stock by its stockholders;
● Failure of Nano Magic’s products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;
● Changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of Nano Magic’s markets;
● Fluctuation in Nano Magic’s quarterly operating results;
● Recruitment or departure of key personnel;
● The commencement or outcome of litigation involving Nano Magic, its industry segments, or some combination; and
● Changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions.
In addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB and the market for nanotechnology companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor
confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in Nano Magic common stock that are unrelated
or disproportionate to the operating performance of Nano Magic’s business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and
industry factors may materially harm the market price of Nano Magic’s common stock and expose Nano Magic to securities class action litigation.
Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources, which could further materially
harm Nano Magic’s financial condition and results of operations.
Nano Magic does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
Nano Magic intends to retain earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of its business, and Nano Magic does not
anticipate paying cash dividends. Stockholders can expect to receive a return on common stock only if the market price of the stock increases.
Future sales of Nano Magic’s common stock may depress its share price.
Sales of substantial number of shares of Nano Magic’s common stock in the public market following a capital raise, or the perception that these
sales may occur, could cause the market price of Nano Magic’s common stock to decline.
16

Nano Magic’s common stock is a “penny stock” under SEC rules, and it may be more difficult to resell securities classified as “penny
stock.”
Nano Magic’s common stock is a “penny stock” under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price
below $5.00). Unless Nano Magic maintains a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice and disclosure
requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as “established
customers” or “accredited investors.” The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers
from effecting transactions in Nano Magic’s securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of Nano Magic’s securities. These
requirements may also affect your ability to resell Nano Magic’s common stock.
Nano Magic has reported material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, and if not remedied, at some point
Nano Magic may determine that these internal controls may not be effective.
In order to remedy the identified deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, Nano Magic may be required to add additional staff.
Nano Magic may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses, or to complete its evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a
timely fashion. During the annual evaluation process, if Nano Magic identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal controls over
financial reporting, then Nano Magic may be unable to assert that its internal controls are effective. If Nano Magic is unable to assert that its
internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors then could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial
reports, which could harm Nano Magic’s stock price.
Nano Magic’s obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, and carry
significant cost.
As a public company, Nano Magic has legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that burden its profit As a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, Nano Magic is required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition,
and proxy and other information statements, and is subject to the rules and regulations implemented by the Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and accounting pronouncements and standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.
Moreover, Nano Magic must monitor changes and comply with any changes to these rules and regulations, and with any future changes in laws,
regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. Changes can create uncertainty for public companies, increase
legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. Laws, regulations and standards are subject to
varying interpretations, in many cases, due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new
guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Nano Magic’s need to comply with existing and evolving regulatory
requirements imposes administrative expense and also diverts management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance
activities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of March 14, 2022, the closing sale price for our common stock as reported on the OTCQB system was $0.20 per share. As of that date, there
were approximately 357 shareholders of record for our common stock. This does not include beneficial owners holding common stock in street
name in brokerage accounts. As of our last record of total shareholders, including those holding stock in street name, there were approximately
3,460 shareholders.
Trading Suspension
On April 30, 2020, the SEC issued an Order of Suspension of Trading (the “Order”) of our common stock for the 10-day period from May 1, 2020 to
May 14, 2020. A trading suspension is not an enforcement action and is not a finding of wrongdoing by the SEC. In the Order, the SEC raised
questions regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information in the marketplace concerning the Company since at least
February 24, 2020, including (a) information in the marketplace claiming that the Company has a patent for a disinfectant that kills “coronavirus”;
and (b) a statement made by the Company on April 7, 2020 regarding the Company’s involvement in the fight against COVID-19. With the
assistance of outside counsel, Dickinson Wright, we have notified the SEC that we do not believe the SEC should have ordered a trading suspension
and we believe that all disclosures by the Company in the marketplace are accurate and adequate.
On May 6, 2020, we, through Dickinson Wright, filed with the SEC a Petition to Terminate Trading Suspension (“Petition”). On May 7, 2020,
Dickinson Wright filed with the SEC a Motion for Expedited Consideration of Petition to Terminate Trading Suspension. In our Petition, we
informed the SEC that neither the Company, nor its officers or directors were the source of the “information in the marketplace” cited by the SEC.
The Company believes that the “information” to which the SEC refers is information that may have been posted by third parties on internet
message boards. The Company cautions investors to rely only on information released by the Company in its current and periodic reports filed with
the SEC, and in press releases that the Company, from time to time, may issue. The Company has a policy of not communicating on internet
message boards and a policy of not communicating with persons seeking to obtain information from the Company outside of the Company’s public
filings and official statements. The Company at no time and in no medium has communicated or published information claiming that “the Company
has a patent for a disinfectant that kills ‘coronavirus.’” The Company has no knowledge of the source of such information entering the marketplace.
The Company’s practice is to cooperate with non-public inquiries conducted by regulators. The Company does have four issued patents – two issued
in April 2017, one issued in November 2018, and one issued in October 2019 – relating to the Company’s work in disinfectants. The testing on the
Company’s formulations for the four patents all occurred prior to the filing in 2015 of the patent applications.
18

Because the SEC has not yet ruled on the Company’s challenge to the trading suspension, on February 14, 2022, the Company filed a petition for a
writ of mandamus with the Unites States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asking the Court to order the SEC to rule on the Company’s
petition filed back in May 2020.
Cash Dividends
We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, have no plans to pay any dividends, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends in the
foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest future earnings, if any, to finance expansion of our business. Any payment of cash dividends in the
future will be dependent upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors determined by our board of directors.

annual meetings of shareholders. However, since less than 50% of the shares eligible to vote cast votes at each meeting, the plan does not
fall into the category of plans approved by shareholders under SEC rules. The 2002 Equity Compensation Plan expired in March 2012 and

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results
during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
22

OVERVIEW
Nano Magic develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products powered by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for
customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of
products powered by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, our defogging products and nanocoating products for
glass and ceramics. We have historically sold our consumer products directly to opticians and ophthalmologists and small optical retailers and we
will continue to do so, even as we are now working to expand our consumer sales by sales to big box retailers and e-commerce. We also develop
and sell printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows. Our Innovation and Technology Center
conducts development services for us and for government and private customers.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March
11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Restrictions imposed by Federal, state and local governments during the
pandemic affected operations of our business and those of our vendors and customers as well as logistics for shipping and receiving supplies and
shipping our products.
Apart from the disruption affecting all manufacturing businesses, some of the raw materials and bottles used to produce our liquid products are
used to produce hand sanitizer and other cleaning product that are in high demand and some of our raw materials and packaging were harder to
find at several points during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, shortages did not continue, and we have been able to obtain adequate
supply. As the pandemic has continued, lead times are significantly extended and costs of raw materials and shipping are up significantly. The
increased use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as a result of the pandemic created additional demand for our antifog product
in 2020 and the first half of 2021. The increased demand caused a number of new participants to start selling antifog product that hurt our sales.
As mask mandates are ending, we are seeing demand fall off. We continue to see progress in our efforts to place Nano Magic products in big box
retail and secured several national big box retail placements. However, these customers are also suffering from supply chain disruptions and their
focus on their core business is delaying roll-out of some of our solutions.
Our principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The Company’s two reportable segments for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes
and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes
to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2020
Revenues:
Product segment $ 4,663,508 $ 4,075,818
Contract services segment 376,105 683,422
Total segment and consolidated sales $ 5,039,613 $ 4,759,240
For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales from the Product segment increased by $587,690, or 14%, as compared to the year ended December
31, 2020. In 2020 and in the first half of 2021, sales of anti-fog solutions drove revenue. We continue to work to increase sales of our Nano Magic
branded solutions by direct sales to consumers, especially using the internet, and are expanding by placing products with pharmacies, big box
stores and other retailer outlets. Revenue opportunities from those solutions is delayed by the logistics and other supply chain issues those
customers are facing in their business.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues of our Contract services segment decreased by $307,317 or 45% as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. This reflects completion of work under government contracts without new contracts to replace them. We have submitted
proposals for funding of other projects and expect, in the ordinary course of business, that some of those proposals will be funded and new
contracts will replace those that have been concluded.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation,
overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred including costs related to government and private contracts in our Contract services segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of revenues increased by $246,886, or 8%. These consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2020
Cost of revenues:
Product segment $ 2,798,698 $ 2,514,119
Contract services segment 549,224 586,917
$ 3,347,922 $ 3,101,036
Total segment and consolidated cost of revenues
Gross profit and gross margin
For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit amounted to $1,691,691 as compared to $1,658,204 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an
increase of $33,487, or 2%. The increase was due primarily to the sales increase as well as the product mix. For the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, gross margins were 34% and 35%, respectively.
Gross profit and gross margin by segment and totals are as follows:

Year Ended December 31,
2021 % 2020 %
Gross profit:
Product segment * $ 1,864,810 40.0% $ 1,561,699 38.3%
Contract services segment * (173,119) -46.0% 96,505 14.1%
Total gross profit $ 1,691,691 33.6% $ 1,658,204 34.8%
* Gross margin is based on respective segments sales.
23

Operating expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating expenses increased by $1,505,355, or 58%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, operating expenses consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2020
Selling and marketing expenses $ 161,194 $ 85,547
Salaries, wages and related benefits 2,330,435 1,020,186
Research and development 34,875 56,816
Professional fees 724,755 803,503
General and administrative expenses 838,446 618,298
Total $ 4,089,705 $ 2,584,350
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, selling and marketing expenses increased by $75,647, or 88%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to attendance at trade shows and brand marketing activities designed to
increase sales channels and market penetration.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, salaries, wages and related benefits increased by $1,310,249 or 128%, as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2020. The change from 2020 reflects the increase in the number of employees to support increased product sales and
the growth in the marketing and sales function and developing our in-house capabilities.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development costs decreased by $21,941, or 39%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020. This is attributable to a shift away from outside consultants as we build our in-house capability.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, professional fees decreased by $78,748, or 10%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2020. This was due, primarily, to the fees for outside counsel incurred in 2020 to challenge the trading suspension.
● For the year ended December 31, 2021, general and administrative expenses increased by $220,148, or 36%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in support costs associated with increased personnel and resources.
Loss from operations
As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2021, loss from operations amounted to $1,765,945 as compared to a
loss from operations of $792,646 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $973,299 or 123%.
Other income
For the year ended December 31, 2021, total other income amounted to $191,381 as compared to other income of $11,591 for the year ended
December 31, 2020, an increase of $179,790 or 1,551%. The change was due primarily to the gain related to the forgiveness of the Payroll
Protection Program loans in 2021.
24

Net loss
As a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2021, our net loss amounted to $1,574,564 as compared to a net loss of $781,055 for
the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $793,509 or 102%.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net loss amounted to $(0.17) per common share (basic and diluted), and a net loss of $(0.10) per
common share (basic and diluted), respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital
balance of $1,003,127 and unrestricted cash of $242,474 as of December 31, 2021.
The following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020:
December 31, December 31, Dollar Percentage
2021 2020 Change Change
Working capital:
Total current assets $ 2,156,666 $ 2,653,831 $ (497,165) -19%
Total current liabilities 1,153,539 2,020,259 866,720 -43%
Working capital: $ 1,003,127 $ 633,572 $ 369,555 58%
The decrease in current assets reflects reduction in accounts receivable during 2021 due to collection efforts. The decrease in current liabilities
includes significant decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities because orders were weaker and purchases were reduced at the end of
the year. In addition to the new Paycheck Protection Loan for our subsidiary Nano Magic LLC obtained in 2020, Applied Nanotech received a
similar loan in 2021.
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,377,056 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net cash used by operating activities of
$2,001,044 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $623,988, or 31%.
● Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflected a net loss of $1,574,564 partially offset by
the add-back of non-cash items totaling $421,136, and $223,628 changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $127,257 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$143,693 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,458,653 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $2,216,070 for the year ended
December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received $1,500,800 in net proceeds from the sale of securities and received
$79,306 in net proceeds from the bank loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, offset by repayments on loans totaling $121,453.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Nano Magic Holdings Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nano Magic Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations, negative cash flow from
operations, and an accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered number 1195 with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they related.
Critical Audit Matter – Going Concern Assessment
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from
operations and expects to continue to incur losses for at least the next twelve months. This matter is also described in the “Emphasis of Matter –
Substantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” section of our report.
We identified management’s judgements and assumptions used to assess the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit
matter due to inherent complexities and uncertainties related to the Company’s projections of operations. Auditing these judgements and
assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgement due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these
matters.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: (1) evaluating management’s assessment and
assessing the reasonableness of key assumptions underlying management’s conclusion, (2) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able
to reduce operating expenditures or raise additional capital if required, (3) assessing management’s plans in the context of other audit evidence
obtained during the audit to determine whether it supported or contradicted the conclusions reached by management.

NANO MAGIC HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2021 AND 2020
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization
Nano Magic Holdings Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Nano Magic” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, develops and sells a portfolio of nano-layer
coatings, nano-based cleaners, and nano-composite products based on its proprietary technology, and performs nanotechnology product research
and development generating revenues through performing contract services. On March 3, 2020, we changed our name from PEN Inc. to Nano
Magic Inc. and on March 2, 2021 we changed our name to Nano Magic Holdings Inc.
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Nano Magic LLC, formerly known as PEN Brands LLC, we develop, manufacture and sell
consumer and institutional products using nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates.
These products are marketed internationally primarily to customers in the optical industry. On March 31, 2020, PEN Brands LLC changed its name
to Nano Magic LLC.
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Applied Nanotech, Inc., we primarily perform contract research services for the Company and for
governmental and private customers.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Applied Nanotech, Inc. and
Nano Magic LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had
losses from operations and net cash used by operations of $1,765,945 and $1,377,056, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. As
indicated in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had positive working capital of $1,003,127 including $242,474 of cash at
December 31, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that these consolidated financial statements are issued. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable
operations, become cash flow positive or raise additional capital. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. They do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and/or classification of the recorded asset amounts and/or the
classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include
estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable, the estimates for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and
equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax
valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, and the fair value of equity incentives.
33

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or
less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments consist of long-term certificates of deposit. The certificate of deposit held at December 31, 2020 was renewed in 2021. It matures in
May 2024 and carries interest at a rate of 2.29% per year.
Accounts Receivable
The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The
allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs, as well as an
assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the allowance for doubtful
accounts is recognized as general and administrative expense.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method based on prices paid for inventory
items. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as sales
to individual customers and expected recoverable values.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or lease term including scheduled renewal terms.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in other income or expense in the year of disposition. The Company
examines the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value
may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not record any impairment charge for the year ended December 31,
2021 and 2020.
Leases
Operating leases are reflected on our balance sheet within operating lease Right-of-use ( ROU) assets and the related current and non-current
operating lease liabilities. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation
to make lease payments arising from lease agreement. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date, the
date on which the lessor began making the underlying asset customizable for our use, based upon the present value of the lease payments over the
respective lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectation
regarding the terms. Variable lease costs such as common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance are expensed as incurred.
Lease Term
The Company calculates the term for each lease agreement to include the noncancelable period specified in the agreement together with (1) the
periods covered by options to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) periods covered by an option to
terminate if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option and (3) period covered by an option to extend (or not terminate) if
controlled by the lessor.
The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease requires significant judgement surrounding
contract-based factors, asset-based factors, entity-based factors and market-based factors.
Lease Payments
Lease payments consist of fixed payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable to the lessee related to the use of the underlying asset during
the lease term.
Incremental Borrowing Rate
The ROU asset and related lease liabilities recorded based on the present value of the lease payments using (1) the rate implicit in the lease or (2)
the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in
a similar economic environment.
Revenue Recognition
We adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”), effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective
method. ASC Topic 606 is a comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized when control of the promised goods
or services are transferred to our customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. The application of ASC Topic
606 requires us to use significant judgment and estimates. Application of ASC Topic 606 requires a five-step model applicable to all revenue
streams as follows:
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the

goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance
and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable based on the
customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay,
which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit
and financial information pertaining to the customer.
34

Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both
capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are
readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is
separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
When a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether the promised goods or services are
capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are
accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
Determination of the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or
services to our customer. We estimate any variable consideration included in the transaction price using the expected value method that requires
the use of significant estimates for discounts, cancellation periods, refunds and returns. Variable consideration is described in detail below.
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts
that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative
Stand-Alone Selling Price (“SSP,”) basis. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation would be sold separately. If the
SSP is not observable, we estimate the SSP based on available information, including market conditions and any applicable internally approved
pricing guidelines.
Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
We recognize contract revenue over time and product revenue at a point in time, when the related performance obligation is satisfied by
transferring the promised goods or services to our customer. Contract revenue is recognized based on a cost-to-cost input method.
Disaggregation of Revenue
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total sales in the United States represent approximately 78% and 87% of total consolidated
revenues, respectively. Germany accounted for 13% and 10% of total sales during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Principal versus Agent Considerations
When another party is involved in providing goods or services to our customer, we apply the principal versus agent guidance in ASC Topic 606 to
determine if we are the principal or an agent to the transaction. When we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to our
customer, we report revenue gross, as principal. If we do not control the goods or services before they are transferred to our customer, revenue is
reported net of the fees paid to the other party, as agent. Our evaluation to determine if we control the goods or services within ASC Topic 606
includes the following indicators:
We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service.
When we are primarily responsible for providing the goods and services, such as when the other party is acting on our behalf, we have indication
that we are the principal to the transaction. We consider if we may terminate our relationship with the other party at any time without penalty or
without permission from our customer.
We have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer.
We may commit to obtaining the services of another party with or without an existing contract with our customer. In these situations, we have risk
of loss as principal for any amount due to the other party regardless of the amount(s) we earn as revenue from our customer.
35

The entity has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
We have discretion in establishing the price our customer pays for the specified goods or services.
Contract Assets
We capitalize costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings as a contract asset in current assets. There were no contract assets recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, contract assets totaled $88,694.
Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of customer advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. We may receive payments from our
customers in advance of completing our performance obligations. We record contract liabilities equal to the amount of payments received in excess
of revenue recognized, Contract liabilities are recorded under the caption “contract liabilities” and are reported as current liabilities on our
consolidated financial statements when the time to fulfill the performance obligations under terms of our contracts is less than one year. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, contract liabilities totaled $45,762 and $90,562, respectively.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation, overhead
and shipping and handling costs incurred.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs incurred relating to the purchase of inventory are included in inventory which is charged to cost of sales as products
are sold. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipped to customers are included in cost of sales. For the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020 shipping and handling costs amounted to $187,154 and $132,458, respectively.
Research and Development
Research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company’s products and under other Company sponsored research and
development projects are expensed as incurred. Costs such as direct labor, direct costs, and other allocated costs incurred to perform research and
development service pursuant to government and private research projects are in included in cost of sales. Research and development costs
incurred in the development of the Company’s products for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $34,875 and $56,816, respectively,
and are included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Advertising Costs
The Company participates in various advertising programs. All costs related to advertising of the Company’s products are expensed in the period
incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $40,459 and $23,345, respectively, and
are included in selling and marketing on the consolidated accompanying statements of operations. These advertising expenses do not include
cooperative advertising and sales incentives which have been deducted from sales.
Federal and State Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income tax using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates
that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax
assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
36

The Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Using that
guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon
examination by the tax authorities. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements. Tax years that remain subject to examination are the years ending on and after December 31, 2018. The
Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. However, no such interest and penalties were
recorded as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in
the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the
employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires
measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The
Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09 in 2018; its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
“measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of
compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the
reporting date.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share”, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) with a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. Basic net loss per common share is
computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock,
common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. Additionally, potentially dilutive common shares
consist of common stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method).
These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. Potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted
shares outstanding as they would have an anti-dilutive impact on the Company’s net income (loss) and consisted of the following:
December 31, December 31,
2021 2020
Stock options 3,123,702 502,892
Stock warrants 6,597,178 5,443,440
Total 9,720,880 5,946,332
Net income (loss) per share for each class of common stock is as follows:
Year Ended Year Ended
December 31, December 31,
Net income (loss) per common shares outstanding: 2021 2020
Common stock $ (0.17) $ (0.10)
Weighted average shares outstanding:
Total weighted average common shares outstanding 9,475,560 7,558,078
37

Segment Reporting
The Company uses “the management approach” in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal
organization and reporting used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source for determining the Company’s reportable segments. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the President of the Company, who
reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company classified
the reportable operating segments into (i) the development, manufacture and sale of consumer and institutional products using nanotechnology to
deliver unique performance attributes (the “Product segment”) and (ii) nanotechnology design and development services for our future products
and for government and private entities (the “Contract services segment”).
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326)
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This standard prescribes an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) that is
based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit
losses, which is intended to result in the timely recognition of losses. Under the CECL model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire
contractual term of the instrument from the date of initial recognition of the financial instrument.
Measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on relevant forecasts that affect collectability. The scope of financial assets within the CECL
methodology is broad and includes trade receivables from certain revenue transactions and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. Different
components of the guidance require modified retrospective or prospective adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard January 1, 2020 and there was no material impact.
The Company does not believe there are any other recently issued and effective, or not yet effective pronouncements that would have or are
expected to have any significant effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2021, that have had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.
Reclassifications
Certain accounts and financial statement captions in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statements.
None of the reclassifications had any impact on the net loss reported in 2020.

NOTE 6 – LEASES
Operating Leases
The Company’s leased assets include offices, production and research and development facilities. Our current lease portfolio has remaining terms
from less than three years up to seven years. Many of these leases contain options under which we can extend the term for several years. Renewal
options are excluded from our calculation of lease liabilities unless we are reasonably assured to exercise the renewal option. Our lease agreements
do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
On September 20, 2017, the Company entered into a three-year lease agreement for 22,172 square feet of office space in Brooklyn Heights, Ohio
beginning September 20, 2017 ended September 20, 2020. Monthly lease payments were $8,688.

for an additional 3-year term, and a second renewal option thereafter for an additional 5-year term. The renewal term is not included in the
calculation of the operating lease liability. As the sole tenant, we are responsible for all taxes, ordinary maintenance, snow removal and other
ordinary operating expenses. Rent is $6.50 per square foot, increasing by $0.25 per year. During the first three years we also have the right to buy
up to a 49% interest in Magic Research LLC for a price equal to 49% of the contributions received from other members. See Note 11, Stockholders’
Equity, for a description of warrants issued to the owners of Magic Research LLC in connection with this lease. The fair value of these warrants
totaling $311,718 were recorded as initial direct costs of obtaining the lease and are included in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet.

The Company maintains deferred tax assets and liabilities that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset

2021 2020
Deferred Tax Assets:
Net operating loss carryforward $ 3,355,000 $ 2,569,000
Stock-based compensation 66,000 1,000
Allowance for inventory obsolescence 14,000 24,000
Accrued compensation 1,000 6,000
Other 39,000 79,000
Total deferred tax assets 3,475,000 2,679,000
Valuation allowance (3,475,000) (2,679,000)
Net deferred tax assets $ - -
The estimated net operating loss carryforward was approximately $3,355,000 at December 31, 2021, which is an estimate of the Company’s net
operating loss carryforward acquired in the Combination after giving effect to the limitation on the usage of such net operating loss carryforwards
due to a change in ownership in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code plus net operating loss carryforwards since the
Combination. The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred income tax asset for the year ended December 31, 2021
because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforward. The potential tax benefit arising from tax
loss carryforwards prior to 2017 will expire between 2021 and 2038, while the potential tax benefits arising after 2017 currently have no expiration
date.
In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the usage of the Company’s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to annual
limitations due to greater than 50% ownership changes. Additionally, the future utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards to offset future
taxable income may be subject to special tax rules which may limit their usage under the Separate Return Limitation Year (“SRLY”) rules. If
necessary, the deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforward that expires prior to utilization as a result of such limitations, with a
corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.
The Company’s 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Corporate Income Tax Returns are subject to Internal Revenue Service examination.
NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
The Company may be, from time to time, subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. We are not currently a defendant in any proceedings. Our policy is to accrue costs for contingent liabilities, including legal proceedings or
unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, when a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December
31, 2021, the Company has not accrued any amount for litigation contingencies.
NOTE 14 – CONCENTRATIONS
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and cash
deposits and investments in cash equivalent instruments.
47

Customer Concentrations
Customer concentrations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:
Product Revenues
For the Years Ended
December 31,
2021 2020
Customer A 16% *%
Customer B 13% 11%
Customer C 12% *%
Customer D 11% *%
Customer E *% 10%
Total 52% 21%
Contract Services Revenues
For the Years Ended
December 31,

Customer F 60% 26%
Customer G 40% *%
Customer H *% 47%
Customer I *% 19%
Total 100% 92%
* Less than 10%
These customers did not have material accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020. A reduction in sales from or loss of such
customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Geographic Concentrations of Sales
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total sales in the United States represent approximately 78% and 87% of total consolidated
revenues, respectively. Germany accounted for 13% and 10% of total sales during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Vendor Concentrations
Vendor concentrations for inventory purchases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are:
For the Years Ended

The vendor above is used for chemical purchases for the production of lens care and anti-fog products.
NOTE 15 – SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company’s principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The products from which revenues are derived are
consistent with the reporting structure of the Company’s internal organization. The Company’s two reportable segments for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020 were the Product segment and the Contract services segment (formerly the research and development segment). The
Company’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating
resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon the Company’s management
organization structure as of December 31, 2021 and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may
result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. There are no inter-segment revenue transactions and, therefore, revenues are only to
external customers. As the Company primarily generates its revenues from customers in the United States, no geographical segments are
presented.
48

Segment operating profit is determined based upon internal performance measures used by the chief operating decision-maker. The Company
derives the segment results from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies the Company uses to derive reportable
segment results are the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment
based upon several metrics, including net revenues, gross profit and operating loss. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of,
and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments. The Company manages certain operating expenses separately at the corporate level
and does not allocate such expenses to the segments. Segment income from operations excludes interest income/expense and other income or
expenses and income taxes according to how a particular reportable segment’s management is measured. Management does not consider
impairment charges, and unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.
Segment information available with respect to these reportable business segments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as
follows:
For the Years Ended December 31,

Item 9. Changes and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated
the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report under Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange
Act. The review for the period ended December 31, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2020, concluded that there were material
weaknesses in our disclosure procedures and controls. For the first two quarters of 2021 and for all of 2020 the weakness related to our ability to
accomplish our financial reporting within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
49

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that
disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations
in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error; consequently, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, effectiveness as it relates to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation
of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets
are made in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Under the supervision of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission published in 2013 and subsequent guidance prepared by the Commission
specifically for smaller public companies. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to
conclude that as of December 31, 2021 the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance
level: We have not had sufficient resources in our accounting function to have segregation of duties so that the initiation of transactions, the
custody of assets and the recording of transactions are performed by separate individuals. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of
transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated our
limited resources and our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that
the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal controls over financial reporting was not effective, we believe that our consolidated financial
statements contained in this Annual Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby
in all material respects.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
50

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our internal control over financial reporting has not changed during the fourth quarter covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as
discussed above.
Item 9B. Other Information.
Not Applicable.

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us under Rule 16a-3(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and Forms 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2020, as well as any written representation from a reporting person that no Form 5 is required, we are not aware that any officer,
director or 10% or greater shareholder failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the aforementioned Forms, reports required by Section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics (as such term is defined in Item 406 of Regulation S-K) (the “Code of Ethics”) that applies to our executive
officers and other employees. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be sent, free of charge, to any person who sends a written request for a copy to
Jeanne Rickert, Secretary, Nano Magic Holdings Inc., 31601 Research Park Drive, Madison Heights, MI 48071
Board Leadership Structure and Board’s Role in Risk Oversight
The Chairman of our Board is now a separate position from that of our Chief Executive Officer. The two roles were separated after our present
Chief Executive Officer was elected to that position in February 2020 and the then-existing Chief Executive Officer was named Chairman. We
believe having a separate Chairman who has previously been in the Chief Executive Officer role provides greater assurance of a continuity in the
vision for our business.
Risk is inherent within every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a variety of risks. As a
manufacturing company with nanotechnology products, operational risks relating to production, sources of supply and quality control are
significant. Given our history of operating losses and our small size, liquidity risk is also significant. Management is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the risks we face, while the Board has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. Taking its risk oversight role, the Board
of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and
functioning as designed. To do this, our directors discuss with management our strategy and risks we face.
53

Board Committees and Director Independence
Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that requires a majority of the members of our Board of Directors (“the Board” or the “Board of
Directors”) to be independent and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our
Board of Directors include “independent” directors. Similarly, we are not required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee
of our Board of Directors. Nonetheless, as a matter of corporate governance best practice, we have established an Audit Committee (as described
below) and our board has determined that Ms. Hodgson ad Mr. Westerman are “independent” as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace rules.
The Board does not have standing compensation or nominating committees. The Board does not believe these committees are necessary based on
the size of our company and the current levels of compensation to corporate officers. The entire Board participates in the consideration of
compensation issues relating to the Chief Executive Officer. We plan to consider establishing compensation and nominating committees at the
appropriate time.
Candidates for director nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board and the operating and strategic challenges
that we face in the next few years. In conducting this assessment, we consider skills, diversity, age, and such other factors as it deems appropriate
given the current needs of the Board and our company, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. We will seek out individuals
with relevant experience to provide strategic guidance and to advise management as we operate our business and introduce new products.
Audit Committee
In February 2016, the Board created an audit committee. It is charged with overseeing (1) the integrity of our financial statements and accounting
and financial reporting processes; (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the performance of our independent auditor and
the qualifications and independence of that firm; (4) our system of disclosure, internal controls and compliance with our Code of Ethics. Howard
Westerman is the sole director on the audit committee. He is not an audit committee financial expert.
Report of the Audit Committee
The audit committee (the “Committee”) oversees the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has
the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including internal control systems. The Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the company’s audited financial statements with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the
applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered accounting firm’s
communications with the Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered accounting firm the
independence of that firm.
In reliance on the reviews conducted, the Committee recommends to the Board of the Directors (and the Board has approved) the inclusion of the
audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC.
54

Stockholder Nominations
To nominate candidates for service as a director on our board a stockholder must hold at least $2,000 in value of shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors. Notice must be given not less than 60 or more than 90 days before the meeting. If less than 75-days’ notice is given of the date
of the meeting, the stockholder’s notice is due not more than 10 days after notice of the meeting is given or after public disclosure of the date of the
meeting, whichever is first. The notice must include information about a proposed candidate: the class and number of shares of stock held of
record, owned beneficially and represented by proxy by the nominating shareholder or any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by,
under common control with or acting in concert with the nominating shareholder (which we refer to as a “shareholder associated person”), and by
each person to be nominated such information to be as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date of such notice; a description of all
contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships between (a) the shareholder making the nomination and any shareholder associated
person that relate to the nomination, (b) the shareholder making the nomination and the proposed nominee and (c) the shareholder making the
nomination, the proposed nominee or any shareholder associated person and any other person or persons that relate to the nomination.
Item 11. Executive Compensation
SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE
The table below sets forth certain compensation information for: (i) our principal executive officer or other individual serving in a similar capacity
during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021; (ii) our two most highly compensated executive officers other than our principal executive officers
who were serving as executive officers at December 31, 2021 whose compensation exceed $100,000; and (iii) up to two additional individuals for
whom disclosure would have been required but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer at December 31, 2021.
Compensation information is shown for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
We sometimes refer to these individuals to as the “named executive officers” as that term is defined under Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The value attributable to any stock or option awards is computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. None of our named executive officers
received compensation in the form of Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation or Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings in fiscal 2021 and
fiscal 2020. The value of stock awards represents the grant date fair value of awards granted with respect to fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 in
accordance with ASC Topic 718. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated
forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. Our methodology, including its underlying estimates and assumptions used in calculating
these values, is set forth in Note 2 to our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
For stock awards, these shares were valued on the grant date based on the quoted trading price of the stock on such date.

Mr. Berman’s contract was originally from April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. In November 2020, the Board acted to extend his contract
through 2023. His salary was $15,000 per month for 2020 and $17,500 per month for 2021. In 2020, Mr. Berman also earned a cash bonus of 10%
of the amount by which revenue at our subsidiary Nano Magic LLC for any calendar quarter of 2020 exceeded $450,000, subject to an annual cap
on the cash bonus payment of $200,000. In 2020, Mr. Berman reached the cap on the cash payment for the bonus; accordingly, options to purchase
an additional 100,000 shares of stock at a price of $0.55 per share became vested. Because revenue for Nano Magic LLC was up more than 20% in
2021 over 2020, Mr. Berman’s salary increases in March 2022 to $20,000 per month. Mr. Berman also earned a sales bonus in 2021 and will earn a
bonus on 2022 equal to 10% of the amount by which gross sales by Nano Magic LLC exceed the sales target for the quarter, subject to an annual
cap.
