PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
ALR TECHNOLOGIES INC. (the “Company” or “ALRT”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 24, 1987 as Mo
Betta Corp. In April 1998, the Company changed its business purpose to marketing a pharmaceutical compliance device.
In December 1998, the common shares of the Company began trading on the Bulletin Board operated by the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc. under the symbol “MBET.” On December 28, 1998, the Company changed its name from Mo Betta Corp. to ALR
Technologies Inc. Subsequently the symbol was changed to “ALRT.”
In 2011, the Company located its headquarters at 7400 Beaufont Springs Drive, Suite 300, Richmond, Virginia, 23225.
During 2011, the Company received FDA clearance and achieved HIPAA compliance for its Diabetes Management System. With these key
achievements and successful clinical trials completed, the Company began implementing its commercialization strategy which included a pilot
program with patients in Kansas in 2014. The Company obtained significant findings from this pilot program which led to the development of its
Insulin Dosage Adjustment, for which it received FDA clearance in 2017, and Predictive A1c, for which it has submitted for worldwide patent
application under the patent cooperation treaty to the World Intellectual Property Organization. The Company is actively seeking to commence
revenue generating activities.

Products
ALRT has developed its Diabetes Solution product by utilizing internet-based technologies to facilitate the health care provider’s ability to
monitor their diabetes patients’ health and ensure adherence to health maintenance activities.
The ALRT Diabetes Solution is a remote monitoring and care facilitation platform that allows patients to upload the blood glucose data from
their meters of a weekly basis. The ALRT System processes and converts each data set to a Predictive A1C value and shares it with the patient’s
physician. The System provides the physician with therapy advancement suggestions based on current clinical practice guidelines. Patients receive
therapy assessments and adjustments in much shorter cycles, keeping A1Cs at target, mitigating diabetes complications and lowering costs of care.
ALRT previously conducted a clinical trial utilizing manual blood glucose data analysis and follow-up care. The trial demonstrated that
remote diabetes care is associated with significant lowering of A1C levels. The study concluded that continuing intervention using an internet-
based glucose monitoring system is an effective way of improving glucose control compared to conventional care. A second clinical trial
demonstrated that this type of Internet-based Blood Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS) was associated with comparable reductions in A1C levels
with that of more expensive Continuing Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMS). The Company is planning further trials to demonstrate the added
value of the predictive A1C and therapy advancement features of the ALRT System.
In the future, the Company may seek to adapt its Diabetes Solution to be used in the management of other chronic diseases. The Company
may be required to obtain additional clearance from the FDA prior to commencing selling activities in the United States for other chronic health
conditions.
Diabetes is a leading cause of death, serious illness and disability across North America. By the year 2030, it is expected that 1 in 10 adults,
globally, will have diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed instances). We believe diabetes is a global pandemic.
Data from the American Diabetes Association shows 30 million Americans have diabetes and 84 million have prediabetes. That’s 1 in 3
Americans coping with the disease or serious threat of it. The total cost of diagnosed diabetes is staggering at $327 billion annually ($237 billion in
direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity), putting serious drag on an already strained health care system. Taking a broader
view, the global cost of diabetes was estimated at a whopping $825 billion annually in 2016.
Diabetes is a lifelong chronic disease with no cure. However, people with diabetes can take steps to control their disease and reduce the risk
of developing the associated serious complications, thereby controlling health care costs. The Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice
Guidelines Expert Committee reports that, “Successful diabetes care depends on the daily commitment of persons with diabetes mellitus to self-
manage through the balance of lifestyle and medication. Diabetes care should be organized around a multi- and interdisciplinary diabetes health
care team that can establish and sustain a communication network between the person with diabetes and the necessary health care and community
systems”. Diabetes incidence rates, economic costs and human costs are increasing even though we know how to control the disease. The Diabetes
Control and Complication Trial conducted from 1983 to 1993 outlined management as follows:
· Testing blood glucose levels four or more times per day;
· Injecting insulin at least three times a day or using an insulin pump;
· Adjust insulin dose according to food intake and exercise;
· Following a diet and exercise plan; and
· Monthly visits to health care team.

We believe there are five causes for diabetes to not be controlled:
1. Patient non-adherence;
2. Unreliable data;
3. Data overload;
4. Clinical inertia; and
5. Insulin under prescription.
As noted in Patrick Connole, “UnitedHealth care, Other Large Insurers Seek Better Adherence to Diabetes Care”, Health Plan Week,
February 11, 2013 Volume 23 Issue 5, 80% of United States patients with diabetes do not follow their prescribed care plan. Central to conventional
diabetes care is patient self-management.
Unreliable Data
As noted in Gonder-Frederick, L.A., et al, “Self Measurement of Blood Glucose: Accuracy of Self-Reporting Data and Adherence to
Recommended Regimen” Diabetes Care, Volume 11, no. 7, July 1988, 77% of patient data contain errors.
Data Overload
Health care professionals (the “HCPs”) face a lack of timely and reliable blood glucose data, resulting in delays to advance therapy and sub-
optimal insulin dosing. The amount of patient data for clinicians to analyze is too vast and significant during 15-minute clinical appointments and
the information they have is unreliable.
Clinical Inertia
As noted in Khunti, K., et al, “Clinical Inertia in People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Cohort Study of More than 80,000 People.”
Diabetes Care, Volume 36, no. 11, July 2013, across over 80,000 patients, when A1C goals were not met, therapy intensification was late across
every measure. It took on average 19 months to escalate patients with an average A1C of 8.7% from single medication to dual therapy and 82
months to escalate patients with an average A1c of 8.8% from dual medication to triple therapy. Furthermore, they found that it took approximately
20 years to advance patients with an average A1C of over 9% to insulin. At the end of the study, less than 50% of the patients had their treatment
intensified.
Furthermore, in Treatment intensification for patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glycaemic control by Fu and Sheenan, it was noted that
out of 11,525 patients investigated with an A1C greater than 8% patients received intensification as follows:
· 37% within 6 months;
· 11% within 6-12 months; and
· 52% never.
Failure to respond to higher than targeted A1C with treatment intensification puts patients with escalated A1C at risk for complications and
diabetes-associated co-morbidities.
Insulin Under Prescription
Insulin dosing is complex requiring review of large amounts of data, which takes significant amounts of time. We believe HCPs routinely
under prescribe insulin to ensure they avoid insulin dosage adjustments, which could result in hypoglycemia for their patients.

Cleveland Clinic Study
A team at Cleveland Clinic examined historical electronic medical record data of more than 7,300 patients with type 2 diabetes and
concluded that there is a pervasiveness of clinical inertia for the management of type 2 diabetes in real-world clinical practice settings.
The selected patients had an A1C value of ≥ 7% on a stable regimen of two oral anti-diabetic agents for at least 6 months (from 2005 to
2016). The median time to treatment intensification after A1C was above target was longer than one year. For patients with an A1c of ≥ 9%,
therapy was not intensified in 44% of patients.
According to lead study author Dr. Kevin Pantalone of Cleveland Clinic’s Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute, “Short of a patient
reporting non-adherence to their existing regimen of diabetes therapies, it is hard to imagine a reason why treatment intensification was not
observed more frequently, when indicated, particularly in patients with an A1C ≥ 9%. In general, if intensification does not occur, the A1c
can be expected to stay the same or get worse, it is not magically going to get better”. (emphasis added)
ALRT Diabetes System for Diabetes Monitoring
ALR has created the Diabetes Solution to address the diabetes marketplace globally. The Company’s Diabetes Solution consists of hardware,
software and diabetes test supplies. We designed the Diabetes Solution to be focused on the HCP and is agnostic and proactive. Our software
operates on iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS systems. Enrollment into the ALRT Diabetes Solution will include a branded glucose meter,
diabetes test strips, lancets and a carrying case. Our technology collects all the blood glucose data from the glucose meters, uploads it to a secure
account and ships diabetes test strips as required. The patient data is aggregated to a Predictive A1C value for a comprehensive view of the
treatment plan and patient adherence to the plan, with the data available (and messaged) to authorized people.
The ALRT Diabetes Management Solution addresses the five causes for not controlling diabetes with:
· Active patient monitoring;
· Direct meter uploads;
· Machine intelligent data processing;
· Predictive A1C; and
· Insulin dosage adjustment.
Active Patient Monitoring
Industry data indicates that 50% or more of people on medications do not take them as prescribed, and that this non-compliance contributes
to 10% of hospitalizations and billions of dollars spent annually in excessive and preventable health care costs. Reminding a person to take an
action is the first step in our system; monitoring their actions and their data is the second, and intervention when needed is the important follow-
up.
The ALRT system monitors patient uploads and the underlying data providing more timely access to patient blood glucose data. Our system
initiates interventions by notifying the HCP of out of range results, or failure to upload data in accordance with the requirements of the care plan.
The ALRT system does not rely upon the patient for uploading data. The ALRT Diabetes Solution provides the notifications and audit trail needed
for achieving best practice results. Its performance tracking allows care teams to identify areas in treatment plans that require change of
improvement.
Direct Meter Uploads
Data is uploaded via Bluetooth directly from the glucometer into the ALRT application. This ensures that the data is accurate and reliable
based on the results of testing.

ALRT Diabetes System (continued)
Machine Intelligent Data Processing
Our machine intelligence processes large amounts of data, notifies relevant stakeholders and flags patients for review making collaboration
real time. Across segments and populations, this also provides significant data points on use of diabetes test strips and insulin, which may be
significant for businesses in those industries.
Predicative A1C
Predictive A1C is a patent-pending unique feature for monitoring the effectiveness of care plans. This technology utilizes data diagnostics to
compare targeted A1C with indicated results. Weekly patient blood glucose data is evaluated, and HCPs are notified as needed for care plan review
when blood glucose values exceed parameters set by the HCPs. Our platform provides HCPs with patient prioritization reports and alerts based on
the Predictive A1C measures and other related diagnostics. Predictive A1C was designed to assist HCPs in addressing clinical inertia in diabetes
care.
Insulin Dose Adjustment
Insulin Dose Adjustment is an FDA-cleared feature that makes optimal insulin adjustment suggestions to HCPs based on dosing guidelines
from organizations like American Diabetes Association. This ensures that HCPs are making timely insulin dosage assessments based on the blood
testing results uploaded. ALRT’s next phase of technology advancement will produce an algorithm for advancing non-insulin diabetes therapies
according to clinical practice guidelines.
Background
In August 2010, the Company received the results of a clinical trial conducted by Dr. Hugh Tildesley using the ALRT Health-e-Connect
System. The trial showed A1c dropping from 8.8% to 7.6% for the Intervention Group using ALRT’s Health-e-Connect System as part of a diabetes
management program. The A1c test is important in diabetes treatment management as a long-term measure of control over blood glucose for
diabetes patients. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, “In general, every percentage drop in A1c blood test results (e.g.,
from 8% to 7%), can reduce the risk of microvascular complications (eye, kidney and nerve diseases) by 40%”. The trial served as the basis for an
article titled Effect of Internet Therapeutic Intervention on A1c Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin, which was published
in the August 2010 Diabetes Care publication.
In July 2011, the follow-up results of the Dr. Tildesley clinical trial were published in the Canadian Journal of Diabetes. Dr. Tildesley
conducted a 12-month study using Health-e-Connect System as an Internet Based Blood Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS) to provide intensive
blood glucose control to determine the effects of internet-based blood glucose monitoring on A1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes treated
with insulin. Dr Tildesley concluded that, “While IBGMS intervention was not a substitute for the patient–physician interaction in a clinical setting,
it significantly improved A1c and, over time, we observed better glycemic control and patient satisfaction”.
In October 2011, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Diabetes Management
System (then known as the Health-e-Connect System) for remote monitoring of patients in support of effective diabetes management programs. The
510(k) clearance enables the Company to commence with the United States marketing and sales launch of its Health-e-Connect System.
In September 2014, the Company initiated its pilot program with one of the Kansas City Metropolitan Physician Association clinics to deploy its
Diabetes Management System. Data from the KCMPA pilot program indicated that a number of patients had achieved reductions in their A1c
levels. Furthermore, the data indicated that patients that left the pilot program had increases in A1c subsequent.
-7-

On February 18, 2015, the Company filed a 510(k) application with the FDA to add a remote insulin dosing recommendation feature to the
Company’s Diabetes Management System. The Company utilized the publicly available algorithm of the AACE and ADA. This feature allows the
Company to regularly run a patient’s blood glucose data (and other key data) through the AACE and ADA algorithm. When the algorithm indicated
that the patient’s dose may not be optimal, the Diabetes Management System would provide the health care provider that a dose change may be
warranted and what the change would be based on AACE and ADA guidelines. The decision about the dose change would rest entirely with the
health care provider. However, this new feature may make a significant contribution to improving the outcomes of diabetes patients if it allowed
HCPs to keep their patients at the optimal dose for longer periods. On September 18, 2017, the Company received clearance from the FDA for its
Insulin Dosage Adjustment feature within the Company’s Diabetes Management System.
On June 20, 2017, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer filed a worldwide patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty to the
World Intellectual Property Office for Predictive A1c feature. The Company holds the rights to use the Predictive A1c feature. During the 2019 year,
the Company and the Chairman have entered into the National Phase for the applications by applying to target member countries.
During 2019, the Company added automated patient management to the Diabetes Management Solution. The Company is also seeking to
have a private label glucometer, diabetes test strips, lancets and carrying cases produced as part of the Diabetes Management Solution. The
Company is in talks with a manufacturer that has global operations.
During 2019, the Company initiated support for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems with the ALRT Diabetes Management
Solution. CGM has become the standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes and is quickly gaining favor with type 2 diabetes patients who use
insulin.
Reimbursement for Health Professionals
The Company continues to work to obtain confirmation that the Diabetes Management System will allow for services to be provided by
physicians that will be reimbursed by health insurance companies. The reimbursement will be a breakthrough, as physicians will be paid to provide
these important new services to their patients with chronic conditions.
Business Development and Marketing Strategy
The Company is focusing its efforts on introducing and marketing its Diabetes Management Solution for medical clinics, hospitals and HCPs
to provide direct care to patients and be reimbursed by the patients’ health benefit plans, as well as to employers due to the significant return on
investment they can achieve by keeping employees/plan members healthy.
The Company is first targeting customers located in the United States because of the large market potential, but will also seek to obtain
regulatory clearance and establish selling operations/agreements for sales and distribution in Canada, Europe, Australia, Singapore, and selected
countries in Asia and South America.
Other Products
The Company does not have any other products outside of the Diabetes Management Solution.
Manufacturers
The Company does not have any designated manufacturers at this time. The Company is in discussions with an international manufacturer
of glucometers, diabetes test supplies and lancets for ALRT branded offerings.

Selling Activities
The Company is actively seeking alliances with health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, insulin providers and other health
care companies that can act as catalysts to effect positive change for containing health care costs and improving health outcomes. We will work
with these types of organizations to introduce the ALRT Diabetes Management System to their network and seek to start significant pilot projects
that will lead to revenue-generating arrangements.

Competition
The Company competes with other corporations that produce diabetes compliance devices, monitoring systems and wellness applications,
many of whom have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. A few companies currently offer compliance monitoring systems,
but either a) at much higher prices, b) have fewer benefits than our system, or c) they do not have FDA clearance. The Company’s competition
includes, but is not limited to, Livongo, Glooko, WellDoc, Medtronics, iGlucose and Microsoft HealthVault.
We feel none of these companies currently offer a comprehensive compliance system that offers the full spectrum of benefits and features
that our Diabetes Management System does with the potential cost efficiencies. We believe that while some of the competitors address the issues of
unreliable data and patient non-adherence, none of the competition address data overload, clinical inertia or insulin under prescription from our
perspective.
Employees and Independent Contractors
The Company has one employee and 17 personnel under independent contractor and consulting arrangements. The consultants of the
Company have contracts that outline their roles and responsibilities as independent contractor, as well as outline the confidentiality requirements
for all matters pertaining to the Company.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2019 include $180,666 (December 31, 2018 - $180,666) of amounts owing to a
former supplier, which the Company has previously disputed and has refused to provide payment. The amount payable stems from services
provided during 2004. The vendor has not sought any actions to collect the amounts and management does not expect to ever pay this amount.
Management asserts that the Company has no obligation to the vendor, as the vendor did not perform the work sought as expected and the
Company never took possession of the end product. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Any additional liability realized,
if any, will be recognized once the amount is determinable. Any gain on settlement of the account payable will be recorded in the period that an
agreement with the supplier is reached and the amount becomes determinable.
Included in notes payable and accrued interest payable, are the following recognized liabilities, which have involved legal proceedings:
1) Mr. H. Gordon Niblock
During 2009, the following judgment was rendered: Niblock Financial Systems, Inc. et al v. ALR Technologies Inc. Forsyth County, North
Carolina file number 0-9-CVS-2220. The judgment against the Company was in the amount of $600,000 in favor of Niblock Financial
Systems, Inc. and $550,000 in favor of H. Gordon Niblock, plus court costs and attorney’s fees. The judgment was rendered as a result of
the Company’s failure to pay amounts due under several promissory notes. On September 30, 2009, subject to the entry of that
judgment, the Company reached a Settlement Agreement with the two plaintiffs, resulting in a cash payment, a credit to the judgment
and an assignment of the Judgment to Christine Kan.
As part of the Settlement Agreement, Mr. Stan Cruitt, a Director of the Company at the time assigned unsecured advances payable by
the Company totaling $425,000 with no stated terms of interest or repayment to the plaintiffs. As part of the Settlement Agreement, the
Company agreed to the following repayment terms:
· $300,000 repayable at a rate of $25,000 per month evidenced by a promissory note; and
· $125,000 repayable in whole by January 15, 2011.
The plaintiffs (Niblock Financial Systems, Inc. et al) filed a motion of default against the Company (ALR Technologies Inc.) in the
Superior Court of Forsyth County, North Carolina (case number 10-CVS-685) for failure to meet the repayment terms of the $300,000
promissory note. On October 26, 2010, case number 10-CVS-685 was heard and the court found in favor of the plaintiff, meaning the
Company was ordered to repay in full principal of $300,000 along with $11,000 of accrued interest from the original settlement date,
being September 30, 2009. During the 2017 fiscal year, the Company determined it would be appropriate to accrue interest of 8% on the
principal outstanding from the judgment date onward. Previously, the Company had recorded imputed interest on the amount, as there
was no legal requirement for the Company to pay interest on the principal. As a result, during the 2017 fiscal year, the Company
reversed the imputed interest, recorded the accrued interest and recorded the difference as a recovery of expense.
On December 18, 2013, the Company was served with a civil summons from H. Gordon Niblock in respect of a complaint for breach of
agreement to repay the promissory note of $125,000 due by January 15, 2011, plus interest at the legal rate of 8% per annum from the
date of maturity of the note until the amount is repaid plus reasonable attorney fees of the proceedings. On February 5, 2014, case
number 13-CVS-7736 for the plaintiff’s motion for entry of default and default judgment was heard in the Superior Court Division of
Forsyth Country, North Carolina. The court found in favor of the plaintiff, ruling that the Company was in default of its agreement with
the plaintiff and that the plaintiff is eligible to seek affirmative relief against the defendant.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (continued).
1) Mr. H. Gordon Niblock (continued)
The Company has not made any repayments under the terms of the settlement agreement for either the loans (and accrued interest)
totaling $747,000 or any costs of the judgment reached against the Company.
2) Ms. Irene Ho
The Company owes a promissory note to Ms. Irene Ho that was demanded for repayment on December 14, 2010. This amount has not
been repaid and interest continues to accrue at the legal rate. The total principal and interest owing to Ms. Irene Ho is approximately
$582,000.
3) Mr. Stan Link
Mr. Stan Link holds a note from the Company, which is in arrears. The matter was reduced to a Consent Judgment in the amount of
$43,608 on April 13, 2009. This full amount is still outstanding and continues to accrue interest at the stated rate of the note. The total
principal and interest owing to Mr. Stan Link is approximately $82,000.
On March 27, 2017 the United States District Court granted the motion to dismiss a complaint filed by MyHealth, Inc. against the Company
in case number 2:16-CV-00535-RWS. The court ordered, adjudged and decreed that My Health, Inc.’s complaints against ALR Technologies Inc.
were dismissed with prejudice. MyHealth, Inc. originally filed a motion of appeal, which subsequently MyHealth, Inc. dismissed. On May 19, 2016,
MyHealth, Inc filed a complaint against the Company that it engaged in willful and knowing patent infringement against MyHealth, Inc.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
The Company’s business is focused on enhancement of adherence to disease and health care management programs through monitoring,
reminders and improved communications. The Company’s primary business markets are the providers of health insurance and the providers of
disease and case management services, including the home care industry.
The largest potential for sustainable long-term growth and value generation lies with the market segments that have the most influence on
the end-user and the most to gain from improved health care results. These market segments are the health insurance providers, and the medical
clinics and physicians who provide the care for people with chronic disease. Our focus is on penetrating the full cycle of health care services,
including medical clinics, hospitals and health plans with diabetics being the initial patient targets.
Revenue
The Company did not generate any revenue in 2019 or 2018. For the past several years, the Company has been devoting its efforts to
developing and commercializing its Diabetes Management System, a blood glucose management platform that combines patient monitoring, patient
adherence, care team communications, automated patient management and insulin dosage suggestions.
In October 2011, the Company announced that it had received FDA clearance to sell its Diabetes Management System in the United States.
In 2012, the Company obtained HIPAA clearance for its Diabetes Management System. The Company since demonstrated that the average patient’s
A1c was reduced by 1.2% over six months in both a clinical trial and a pilot program. Subsequently, the Company developed and obtained FDA
clearance for Insulin Dose Adjustment and developed and is patent pending for its proprietary Predictive A1c innovation. The Company is ready to
launch the Diabetes Management System commercially and is seeking a suitable opportunity.
Product Development
During the 2019 fiscal year, the majority of the Company’s product development efforts were expended to:
· Further development of its Diabetes Management System;
· Prepare for additional functionality to enhance care facilitation activity;
· Increase compatibility and usability of the Diabetes Management System;
· Initiate development of its Diabetes Management System for compatibility with continuous glucose monitoring technologies;
· Implement advances as a result of user feedback; and
· Other general advances of the Diabetes Management System.
With the completion of the Diabetes Management System, the Company is currently focusing its efforts on the commercial launch plans of
the product and conducting research activities for future attributes and applications for the Diabetes Management System.
Product development and research costs were $1,625,000 in 2019 and $409,000 in 2018. Included in product development costs were stock-
based compensation costs of $1,243,000 in 2019 and $186,000 in 2018.
-16-

Operating Capital
The Company has no revenues and has not generated any revenues since creating its Diabetes Management System. The Company is
funding operations through the line of credit financing it has available. The majority of the Company’s expenditures go towards product
development, professional fees and administrative activities. The Company incurs significant amounts of interest expense from its debts
outstanding and, from time to time, the grant of stock options in exchange for either 1) deferred payment, 2) agreements of note extensions, and 3)
increased borrowing limits provided. All stock options granted related to the debts of the Company have been recorded at their fair value using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and are expensed over the agreed upon term of the debt instrument where applicable. Where the debt of the
Company is a line of credit arrangement with no fixed terms of repayment, the stock option expense is fully recognized at the time of grant.
There is no certainty of the timing or amount of cash flows from sales, and if sales do begin, there is no certainty that it will reach the level
necessary to cover operating costs and costs to service the Company’s debts. The Company has limited resources and is seeking to penetrate
markets with indirect competition with much greater resources. The Company is seeking to displace generally accepted processes for diabetes
management, which means it is directly entering into an unestablished market. Management is evaluating alternatives to penetrate both existing
and new marketplaces in order to generate cash flows. Management believes the business plan of the Company will give it the best opportunity to
achieve commercial feasibility, but due to the current acceptance levels of the Diabetes Management System, there is substantial uncertainty over
the Company’s ability to execute the plan, the level of success associated with the execution of its business plan or the actual timeline to execute
the plan. If the actual timeline for the execution of the business plan is substantially longer than planned, it could jeopardize the Company’s long-
term success. For these reasons the Company is seeking additional financing.
The Company has operating lines of credit with a borrowing limit of $12,300,000. As at December 31, 2019, the Company had borrowing
available of approximately $543,000 on its line of credit. The Company does not have any other facilities readily available at this time and has
continued to receive funding under the terms of the existing line of credit that has reached the borrowing limit from the Chief Executive Officer.
Management will seek to acquire additional financing to allow the Company to become a commercially viable enterprise, whereby it can generate
sufficient cash flow from the sales of its Diabetes Management System to support its cost of operations, overhead and repay its obligations.
There is no certainty that the Company will ever be able to achieve the level of sales necessary to cover operating costs or achieve the level
of sales before the borrowing limits on the lines of credit financing are reached. The Company will require additional financing in the future for
which there is no guarantee it will receive. Furthermore, even if the Company is able to achieve sufficient cash flows to support operations, it will
need to service its debt obligations, which as of December 31, 2019 were $31,100,000. A total of approximately $25,200,000 is owed to the
Chairman and his family.
Operating Issues
The Company has expended significant efforts introducing the Diabetes Management System to specified retail chains, pharmaceutical
manufacturers, contract research organizations, health management organizations, pharmacy benefits managers and certain clinics treating
specific disease conditions. The Company has not had sales for several years. During the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, the Company has devoted
100% of its efforts to developing the Diabetes Management System for commercial launch. Management plans for the Company to become a
commercially viable enterprise through the sale of Diabetes Management subscriptions.
If management is not successful in its plans, the Company may be required to raise additional funds from its existing and prospective
shareholders or debtholders, which it may not be able to accomplish on satisfactory terms for the Company.

Management Compensation
During 2019, the Company’s sole officer, Mr. Sidney Chan, earned $15,800 per month, which was recorded as an increase to the borrowings
on the lines of credit provided by Mr. Chan to the Company. Mr. Chan’s compensation was the same for the 2018 fiscal year. Mr. Chan was granted
the option to acquire 120,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with increasing the borrowing limit on the Company’s line of credit by
$1,800,000.
The Company issues stock options as compensation from time to time. No directors of the Company earn service fees for their position as
director of the Company. Those directors that hold a position as officer or consultant of the Company earn fees for those services provided. During
2019, the Company granted incentive options to its directors as follows:
· Mr. Ken Robulak was granted the option to acquire 6,650,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.035 per share
for five years;
· Dr. Alfonso Salas was granted the option to acquire 5,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $0.035 per share
for five years; and
· Mr. Ronald Cheng and Mr. Peter Stafford were each granted the option to acquire 4,500,000 shares of common stock of the
Company at a price of $0.035 per share for a term of five years.
The Company did not grant any incentive options to its directors during 2018.

The net loss for the Company’s years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was significantly impacted by the grant of options to obtain
additional debt financing as follows:
Year Ended Year Ended

The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 118% ($4,882,000) higher than the net loss at December 31, 2018 as a result of the
grant of options with an incremental fair value of $4,544,000 during 2019 as compared to the prior year. The incremental fair value from the grant
of the options in 2019 accounted for 93% of the total change in net loss as compared to 2018. Aside from the stock-based compensation included
within operating expenses, the Company had an increase in operating loss of $260,000, which was primarily a result of increased fees for
professionals, development personnel and management personnel.
General and Administrative
General and administrative costs incurred consist of salaries and consulting fees of management personnel, stock-based compensation for
options granted to management personnel, travel and trade show costs, rent of the Company’s corporate office, website development costs and
general costs incurred through day-to-day operations.
During the year, the Company had a significant increase in the selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily driven by an increase
in stock-based compensation. The components of general and administrative expense and the changes therein can be seen as follows:

Results of Operations (continued)
The increase in stock-based compensation accounted for 92% of the increase of general and administrative expenses in the current year as
compared to the prior year. During the current year, the Company granted 31 directors, consultants, sales agents and advisors the option to
purchase 134,050,000 shares of common stock in exchange for their services, of which 73,050,000 vested during the year. We anticipate that cash-
based operating expenses for 2020 will be similar to the amounts in 2019, before any new endeavors or projects. Aside from the change of general
and administrative expenses related to stock-based compensation, which is non-cash-based, general and administrative costs incurred during 2019
increased by $21,000 during the 2018 fiscal year.
Product Development
Product development costs consists of a) services provided by contractors of the Company, b) expenses incurred for product development,
and c) stock-based compensation for options granted to members of the product development team. Product development costs of the Company
were consistent with the prior year with changes of the components as follows:

Total $ 1,625,000 $ 409,000 1,216,000
For the 2019 fiscal year, the Company was anticipating similar or slightly reduced product development expenses as compared to 2018,
before any changes from stock-based compensation expense. Development costs excluding stock-based compensation increased by $158,000 during
the 2019 fiscal year as compared to the 2018 fiscal year. The Company had an increase in development consulting fees incurred as compared to the
prior year as a result of increased services provided by certain consultants during the year.

Interest Expense
During the year, the Company incurred an increase in interest expense as compared to the prior year as a result of a higher interest-bearing

During the 2019 fiscal year, the Company borrowed an additional $733,000 from its line of credit facilities (interest rates of 1% per month
on the borrowed balance). In addition to incurring interest for a full year on the amounts borrowed to the end of the 2018 fiscal year, this
borrowing during 2019 resulted in significantly higher interest incurred on the lines of credit for the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2019,
the Company anticipated financing its operations through line of credit borrowing facilities, which, as a result, its interest expense related to the
line of credit facilities further increased.

Imputed Interest
During the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years, the Company had certain zero interest promissory notes and accounts payable in excess of one year.
Pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, these zero interest amounts are considered to be financing items in nature and are assigned a
deemed interest rate (1% per month). The interest incurred on these is expensed as imputed interest; instead of increasing the liabilities of the
Company, imputed interest expense is allocated to equity under the financial statement line item additional paid-in capital. The Company’s zero

Professional Fees
Professional fees expense consists of consulting and advisory fees of certain professionals retained, audit fees, legal fees and stock-based
compensation for options granted to professionals. By component of professional fees, the variance can be seen as follows:
Amount ($)
Professional Fees: 2019 2018 Increase /
(Decrease)
Legal fees $ 35,000 $ 7,000 38,000
Professional advisors retained 53,000 25,000 28,000
Corporate auditor 43,000 18,000 25,000
Stock-based compensation 392,000 401,000 (9,000)
Total $ 523,000 $ 451,000 82,000
The increase in professional fees for the 2019 fiscal year as compared to the prior year can be attributed to the Company granting stock-
based compensation to its service providers as opposed to cash-based compensation. The Company increased its cash-based professional fees by
$80,000 from the prior year as a result of increased business activity in the current year, filing of patent applications and increased corporate legal
costs.
We had anticipated cash-based professional fees to increase for the 2019 fiscal year as compared to the 2018 fiscal year, as in the prior year
we benefited from the timing of certain professional engagements, which had limited expense in the 2018 fiscal year. For 2020, we expect the cash-
based professional fees to be consistent with the 2019 fiscal year; however, this could vary significantly if business milestones are reached.

Working Deficiency $ (31,088,000) $ (28,395,000) (2,693,000) (9)
The Company has a severe working capital deficiency. It does not have the ability to service its current liabilities for the next twelve months
and is reliant on its line of credit facilities to meet its ongoing operations. The Company has $543,000 remaining to borrow on its line of credit
facility and will require additional funding for the 2020 fiscal year based on its operating requirements. Until the Company has revenue-producing
activities that exceed its operating requirements, it will be unable to service its current liabilities and the working capital deficit will continue to
increase. As of the date of this management discussion and analysis, the Company has not commenced revenue-generating activities, nor does it
know when they will commence. There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to repay its current liabilities in the near term or any time
in the future, which could ultimately lead to business failure.
Current Liabilities
The Company has current liabilities of $31,090,000 as at December 31, 2019 as compared to $28,398,000 as at December 31, 2018. Current
liabilities were as follows:

Total current liabilities $ 31,090,000 $ 28,398,000 2,701,000 9
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consists of the trade payables and accrued liabilities of the Company. Accounts payable totaling
approximately $760,000 and accrued liabilities totaling $181,000 are older than one year old with the majority of these being more than ten years
old.
Interest Payable
Interest payable relates to the unpaid interest expense incurred on the promissory notes to related parties and promissory notes to arm’s
length parties. The change from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018 is equal to the interest expense incurred on both categories of
promissory notes during the 2019 fiscal year.
Promissory Notes to Related Parties and Promissory Notes Payable to Arm’s Length Parties
The Company has promissory notes with 20 individuals or corporations that relate to historical amounts borrowed. There has been no new
activity for several years. All of these promissory notes are past due and continue to accrue interest at their respective legal rates of interest
(mostly 1% per month). The change in the current year relates to the assignment of an amount of $140,000 from an arm’s length creditor to a
related party creditor.
-24-

Current Liabilities (continued)
Lines of Credit
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has borrowed total principal of $11,757,000 (2018 - $11,024,000). During the December 31, 2019
year, the Company incurred interest expense of $1,366,000 (2018 - $1,288,000).
Line of Credit from Ms. Christine Kan
The Company obtained a line of credit of US$1,000,000 from Ms. Christine Kan (the spouse of the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company) in March 2010 (the terms of which were finalized in May 2010). The loan was unsecured with interest payable
on funds borrowed at 1% per month. These proceeds were to be put towards working capital and the continued development of the Company’s
product line. On January 3, 2011, the creditor granted the Company an increase in the borrowing limit from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company has borrowed $2,000,000 (2018 - $2,000,000) and has accrued interest outstanding of $1,976,000 (2018 -
$1,736,000). During the 2019 fiscal year, the Company borrowed $nil (2018 - $nil) and incurred interest of $240,000 (2018 - $240,000).
Line of Credit from Mr. Sidney Chan
On March 6, 2011, the Company obtained a $2,500,000 line of credit from Mr. Sidney Chan (the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company). Under the terms of the arrangement, the amount borrowed by the Company bears simple interest at a rate of 1% per
month. The amount borrowed is secured by a general security agreement over the assets of the Company and is due on demand. Originally, the line
of credit was for a comprehensive marketing program, but subsequently was amended to be for general corporate purposes. On April 1, 2014, Mr.
Chan and the Company executed an amending agreement whereby Mr. Chan increased the borrowing limit of the line of credit he has provided to
the Company from $4,000,000 to $5,500,000. On May 29, 2015, the borrowing limit was further increased to $7,000,000. On July 1, 2016, the
borrowing limit was further increased to $8,500,000 and on December 11, 2019, increased further to $10,3000,000. As of December 31, 2019, the
Company has borrowed $9,757,000 (2018 - $9,024,000) and has accrued interest outstanding of $5,577,000 (2018 - $4,501,000). During 2019, the
Company borrowed $733,000 (2018 - $626,000) and incurred interest of $1,126,000 (2018 - $1,048,000). During the year, $50,000 of accrued
interest was applied as settlement for the conversion of options to shares. In the prior year, the Company had exceeded the borrowing limit on this
line of credit, but had continued to receive funding under the same terms.
Short- and Long-Term Liquidity
The Company has incurred significant operating losses over the past several fiscal years (2019 - $9,005,000; 2018 - $4,122,000), is currently
unable to self-finance its operations, has a working capital deficit of $31,088,000 (2018 - $28,395,000), an accumulated deficit of $87,655,000
(2018 - $78,650,000), limited resources, no source of operating cash flow, no assurances that sufficient funding will be available to conduct further
product development and operations, and no assurance the Company’s current projects will be commercially viable or profitable.
All of the Company’s debt financing is past due or due on demand. The Company will seek to replace this financing with funds generated by
operations, replacement debt, or from equity financings through private placements or the exercise of options. While certain of the Company’s
creditors have agreed not to demand immediate payment. There is no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future. As the Company is
past due or in default on its promissory notes payable and accrued interest payable, there is substantial risk of future legal action against the
Company. The Company has faced consent judgments and demand notices against it for overdue promissory notes. Failure to obtain either
replacement financing or creditor consent to delay the repayment of existing financing could result in the Company having to cease operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the accounting policies that are most critical to its financial condition and results of operations
and involve management’s judgment and/or evaluations of inherent uncertain factors are as follows:
Options and warrants issued in consideration for debt. The Company allocates the proceeds received from long-term debt between the
liability and the options and warrants issued in consideration for the debt, based on their relative fair values, at the time of issuance. The amount
allocated to the options or warrants is recorded as additional paid-in capital and as a discount to the related debt. The discount is amortized to
interest expense on a yield basis over the term of the related debt.
Stock-based compensation. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (“SFAS
123R”). SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing
model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in the
Company’s financial statements. Stock-based compensation recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the stock-based
payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period. The Company estimates the fair value of the stock options using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility
assumption was determined using historical volatility of the Company’s common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
In July 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic
260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this update change
the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down-round features. When determining
whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down-round feature no longer precludes equity
classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. The amendments also clarify existing disclosure
requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no
longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down-round feature. For freestanding equity
classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share ("EPS") in accordance with Topic 260 to
recognize the effect of the down-round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to
common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down-round features are now subject to
the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options),
including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions
of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Accounting Standards Codification, to a scope exception. Those amendments do not
have an accounting effect. ASU 2017-11 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, which is effective for
the Company for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact, if any, of implementing
this guidance on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
-27-

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Topic 842 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model
that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, on the balance sheet for all leases with terms
longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the
statement of income. Originally, entities were required to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective approach, which required prior
periods to be presented under this new standard with certain practical expedients available. However, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11,
Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as
an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease
accounting guidance. The Company adopted Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 which did not result in any impact on the Company’s financial
statements.
Issued
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact its financial statements. The Company does
not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or statement of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ALR Technologies Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ALR Technologies Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related
statements of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit, and cash flows, for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statements, the Company has not generated revenues since inception, has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses
are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in this regard are described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

1. Basis of presentation, nature of operations and going concern
ALR Technologies Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 24, 1987. The Company has
developed a compliance monitoring system that will allow for HCPs to remotely monitor patient health conditions and provide patient health
management. On October 17, 2011, the Company announced that it had received Section 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and
Drug Administration for its Health-e-Connect System. The Company is currently seeking pilot programs to deploy its product.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) in U.S. dollars and on a going concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future. Several adverse conditions cast substantial doubt on the validity of
this assumption. The Company has incurred significant losses over the past several fiscal years (2019 - $9,005,537; 2018 - $4,122,133), is
currently unable to self-finance its operations, has a working capital deficit of $31,088,266 (2018 - $28,394,986), accumulated deficit of
$87,655,745 (2018 - $78,650,208), limited resources, no source of operating cash flow, and no assurance that sufficient funding will be
available to conduct continued product development activities. If the Company is able to finance its required product development activities,
there is no assurance the Company’s current projects will be commercially viable or profitable. The Company has debts comprised of accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable, lines of credit and promissory notes payable totaling $31,090,104 (2018 - $28,398,364)
currently due, due on demand or considered delinquent. There is no assurance that the Company will not face additional legal action from
creditors regarding delinquent accounts payable, promissory notes payable and interest payable. Any one or a combination of the above
conditions could result in the failure of the business and cause the Company to cease operations.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support of its creditors and its ability to obtain
financing to fund working capital and overhead requirements, fund the development of the Company’s product line, and ultimately, the
Company’s ability to achieve profitable operations and repay overdue obligations. Management has obtained short-term financing from related
parties through line of credit facilities with available borrowing in principal amount up to $12,300,000. As of December 31, 2019, the total
principal balance outstanding was $11,757,325. The resolution of whether the Company is able to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the realization of management’s plans. When additional financing is required, the Company plans to raise needed capital through the
exercise of share options and by future common share private placements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise
any additional debt or equity capital from the sources described above, or that the lenders in the line of credit arrangements will maintain the
availability of borrowing from the line. If management is unsuccessful in obtaining short-term financing or achieving long-term profitable
operations, the Company will be required to cease operations.

1. Basis of presentation, nature of operations and going concern (continued)
All of the Company’s debt is either due on demand or is in default, while continuing to accrue interest at its stated rates. The Company will seek
to obtain creditors’ consents to delay repayment of the outstanding promissory notes payable and related interest thereto, until it is able to
replace this financing with funds generated by operations, recapitalization with replacement debt or from equity financings through private
placements. While some of the Company’s creditors have agreed to extend repayment deadlines in the past, there is no assurance that they will
continue to do so in the future. In the past, creditors have successfully commenced legal action against the Company to recover debts
outstanding. In those instances, the Company was able to obtain financing from related parties to cover the verdict or settlement; however,
there is no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain the same financing in the future. If the Company is unsuccessful in obtaining
financing to cover any potential verdicts or settlements, the Company will be required to cease operations.
The Company’s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond 2019. Additionally, the Company’s capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including the success of the Company’s continued product development and distribution efforts. The Company plans to
continue financing its operations with the lines of credit it has available.
There is no assurance that the Company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if
additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.
2. Significant accounting policies
a) Stock-based compensation
The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company estimates the fair value of share-
based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in the Company’s financial statements. The Company estimates the fair
value of the stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
b) Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and operating
loss carry-forwards that are available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. When it is not considered to be more likely than not that a
deferred income tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is provided for the excess.
The Company follows the accounting requirements associated with uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, Income Taxes. Using that guidance, tax positions initially need
to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more-likely-than-not the positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax
authorities. It also provides guidance for derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements.
c) Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the
measurement of stock-based compensation, the fair value of financial instruments, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Management believes the estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
d) Loss per share
Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and the dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares are not
included in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for diluted loss per common share when the effect would
be anti-dilutive.

e) Comprehensive income
Comprehensive income is the overall change in the net assets of the Company for a period, other than changes attributable to transactions
with stockholders. It is made up of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income consists of net income and
other gains and losses affecting stockholders' equity that under GAAP are excluded from net income. The Company has no items of other
comprehensive income (loss) in any period presented. Therefore, as presented in the Company's statements of operations, net loss equals
comprehensive loss.
f) Fair value of financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts payable, promissory notes payable, interest payable and lines of credit. The fair
values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short periods to maturity of these instruments.
For fair value measurement, U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in
measuring fair value:
Level 1 — observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3 — unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
g) Recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements
i. Adopted
In July 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity (Topic 480), and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of this update change the classification analysis
of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down-round features. When determining whether certain
financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down-round feature no longer precludes equity
classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity's own stock. The amendments also clarify existing
disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded
conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as a result of the existence of a down-round
feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require entities that present earnings per share
("EPS") in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down-round feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a
dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded
conversion options that have down-round features are now subject to the specialized guidance for contingent beneficial conversion
features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options), including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The
amendments in Part II of this update recharacterize the indefinite deferral of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as
pending content in the ASC, to a scope exception. Those amendments do not have an accounting effect. There was no impact from
adopting this standard.

g) Recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements (continued)
i. Adopted (continued)
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Topic 842 is effective for public companies for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard establishes a right-of-
use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, on the balance
sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting
the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. Originally, entities were required to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a modified
retrospective approach, which required prior periods to be presented under this new standard with certain practical expedients
available. However, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows entities the
option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in
the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. The Company adopted Topic
842 as of January 1, 2019 which did not result in any impact on the Company’s financial statements.
ii. Issued
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact its financial statements. The
Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
impact on its financial position or statements of operations.

8. Commitments and contingencies
a) Contingencies
The Company has had three judgments against it relating to overdue promissory notes and accrued interest, and a fourth creditor has
demanded repayment of an overdue promissory note and accrued interest. To date, the Company has not repaid any of these promissory
notes and related accrued interest and could be subject to further action. The legal liability, totaling $1,188,968, of these promissory notes
and related accrued interest have been fully recognized and recorded by the Company. The Company has accrued additional interest of
$220,472 related to one of these promissory notes.
b) Commitments
The Company has a consulting arrangement with Mr. Sidney Chan, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Company. Under the terms of the contract, Mr. Chan will be paid $180,000 per annum for services as Chief Executive Officer. The contract
can be terminated at any time with thirty days’ notice and the payment of two years’ annual salary. Should the contract be terminated, all
debts owed to Mr. Chan and his spouse must be immediately repaid. The initial term of the contract is for one year and automatically
renews for continuous one-year terms. Also, under the terms of the contract are the following:
i. Incentive revenue bonus
Mr. Chan will be entitled to a 1% net sales commission from the sales of any of the Company’s products at any time during his life,
regardless if Mr. Chan is still under contract with the Company.
ii. Sale of business
If more than 50% of the Company’s stock or assets are sold, Mr. Chan will be compensated for entering into non-compete agreements
based on the selling price of the Company or its assets as follows:
· 2% of sales price up to $24,999,999 plus
· 3% of sales price between $25,000,000 and $49,999,999 plus
· 4% of sales price between $50,000,000 and $199,999,999 plus
· 5% of sales price in excess of $200,000,000.

9. Financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, interest payable, promissory notes payable to unrelated parties,
promissory notes payable to related parties and lines of credit from related parties.
a) Fair value
The fair values of cash and certain accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short periods to maturity of
these instruments.
Certain accounts payable have been outstanding longer than one year. The Company has recorded imputed interest at a rate of 1% per
month over the period the payables have been outstanding for longer than one year, with a corresponding amount recognized in additional
paid-in capital. The calculated amount represents the implicit compensation for the use of funds beyond a reasonable term for regular trade
payables.
For the purposes of fair value analysis, promissory notes payable to related parties and promissory notes payable to unrelated parties can be
separated into two classes of financial liabilities:
i. Interest-bearing promissory notes, lines of credit and related interest payable; and
ii. Non-interest-bearing promissory notes past due.
The interest-bearing promissory notes payable are all delinquent and have continued to accrue interest at their stated rates. The Company
currently does not have the funds to extinguish these debts and will continue to incur interest until such time as the liabilities are
extinguished. There is not an active market for delinquent loans for a Company with a similar financial position. Management asserts the
carrying values of the promissory notes and related interest payable are a reasonable estimate of fair value, as they represent the
Company’s best estimate of their legal obligation for these debts. As there is no observable market for interest rates on similar promissory
notes, the fair value was estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company has one non-interest-bearing promissory note payable past due. There is not an active market for default loans not bearing
interest nor is there an observable market for lending to companies with a financial position similar to the Company. The Company has
recorded imputed interest at a rate of 1% per month over the life of the promissory notes, with a corresponding amount recognized in
additional paid-in capital representing the implicit compensation for the use of funds. Management asserts the payment date for these
amounts cannot be reasonably determined. Management further asserts there is not a determinable interest rate for arm’s length
borrowings based on the current financial position of the Company and asserts the carrying value is the best estimate of the Company’s
legal liability and represents the fair value for the promissory note. This would be considered a Level 2 input in the fair value hierarchy.

9. Financial instruments (continued)
b) Credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash. The Company only has an immaterial cash balance
and is not exposed to significant credit risk.
c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises two types of risk: interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
i. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk consists of two components:
a) Cash flow risk
To the extent that payments made or received on the Company’s monetary assets and liabilities are affected by changes in the
prevailing market interest rates, the Company is exposed to interest rate cash flow risk.
The Company is exposed to interest rate cash flow risk on promissory notes payable of $500,000, which incur a variable interest rate
of prime plus 1%. A hypothetical change of 1% on interest rates would increase or decrease net loss and comprehensive loss by
$5,000.
b) Price risk
To the extent that changes in prevailing market interest rates differ from the interest rate on the Company’s monetary assets and
liabilities, the Company is exposed to price risk.
The Company’s promissory notes payable consist of $500,000 of variable interest rate notes and $4,786,319 of fixed interest rate
notes. All of these notes are past due and are currently due on demand while interest continues to accrue. Due to the delinquency of
the fixed interest rate promissory notes payable, there is no active market for these instruments and fluctuations in market interest
rates do not have a significant impact on their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2019, the effect on net loss and comprehensive loss of a hypothetical change of 1% in market interest rate cannot
be reasonably determined.

c) Market risk (continued)
ii. Foreign currency risk
The Company incurs certain accounts payable and expenses in Canadian dollars and is exposed to fluctuations in changes in exchange
rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. As at December 31, 2019, the effect on net loss and comprehensive loss of a hypothetical
change of 10% between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would not be material. The Company has not entered into any foreign currency
contracts to mitigate risk.
10. Income taxes
The provision for income taxes differs from the result that would be obtained by applying the statutory tax rate of 21% (2018 - 21%) to income
before income taxes. The difference results from the following items:
December 31, December 31,
2019 2018
Computed expected benefit of income taxes $ (1,891,163) $ (865,648)
Stock-based compensation 1,286,201 332,082
Non-deductible interest expense 25,722 25,658
Impact of change in tax rate — 5,163,267
Expiry of tax credits 18,486 —
True up of prior year balances 37,917 —
Increase (decrease) in valuation allowance 522,837 (4,655,359)
Income tax provision $ — $ —
The components of the net deferred income tax asset, the statutory tax rate and the amount of the valuation allowance are as follows:
December 31, December 31,
2019 2018
Net operating loss carried forward $ 44,625,741 $ 42,136,043
Tax rate 21% 21%
Deferred income tax assets 9,371,406 8,848,569

10. Income taxes (continued)
The potential benefit of the deferred income tax asset has not been recognized in these financial statements since it cannot be assured that it is
more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The Company believes that the available objective evidence creates
sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred income tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded.
The operating losses amounting to $44,625,741 for utilization in the United States of America, the jurisdiction where they were incurred, will
expire between 2020 and 2039 if they are not used. The following table lists the fiscal year in which the loss was incurred and the expiration

with the issuance of 2,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company. The shares were issued on March 11, 2020.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
included in the Company’s reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to ALR Technologies Inc., and was made known to them by others within those
entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at these reasonable assurance levels.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and internal controls will
prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management or board override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
CEO and CFO Certifications
Appearing immediately following the Signatures section of this report there are Certifications of the CEO and the CFO. The Certifications
are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications). This Item of this report, which you

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding
controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making
this assessment, the management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on management’s assessment, as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.
Based on this assessment, we found our internal control over financial reporting to be not effective for the following reason:
(1) insufficient written policies and procedures for reporting requirements and accounting and financial reporting with respect to the
requirements and application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.
Management of the Company believes that the material weaknesses set forth in (1) did not affect the Company’s financial results. The
Company retains a consultant who has the technical expertise and knowledge to implement the proper segregation of duties and the development
of effective internal controls over financial reporting. The Company will advance its internal controls over financial reporting to meet its future
needs at the appropriate time.
In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following
material weaknesses: (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and
application of the U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.
-58-

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis, and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2019 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
