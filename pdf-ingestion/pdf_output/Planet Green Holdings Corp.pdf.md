ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Business
Planet Green is a Nevada company established in 1986 and is headquartered in Flushing, New York. We are a diversified technology and consumer
products company with presence in North America and China in the follow businesses: Chemical Products, Tea Products and Online Advertising
Services.
Planet Green manages its operation in three business segments which include:
● to grow, produce and distribute Cyan brick tea, black tea and green tea in China; and
● to research, develop, manufacture and sell chemical products including formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde adhesive, methylal, ethanol fuel,
fuel additives and clean fuel in China; and
● to develop and operate a demand side platform which empowers buyers of advertising to manage and optimize their digital advertising
across different real-time bidding networks in North America and China
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update
Recently, there is an ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in China and has since spread rapidly globally.
The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities globally for the past few
months. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, and because substantially all of our business operations and our workforce are concentrated in China, our business, results of operations
and financial condition have been and will continue to be adversely affected. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future
developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government
authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
● We temporally closed our offices and production facilities to adhere to the policy from February 2020 until April 2020, as required by
relevant PRC regulatory authorities. Our offices are slowly reopening pursuant to local guidelines. In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19
outbreak has caused disruptions in our manufacturing operations, which have resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of
our customers.
● Some of our employees were in mandatory self-quarantine from January 2020 to April 2020.
● Our customers have been negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may reduce the demand of our products. As a result, our revenue and
income may be negatively impacted in 2020.
● The situation may worsen if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We continued to closely monitor our collections throughout 2020.
A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the manufacturing, delivery and assembly process within any of our
production facilities could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs and reduced revenue.
We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the
outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely
affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial
condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse
effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that
we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Now that we are closer to
containment of the COVID-19 pandemic with the emergence of several very effective vaccines, market participants expect the economy will fully
recover over the next year or two.

Organizational Structure
PLAG was incorporated on February 4, 1986 and was formerly known as “American Lorain Corporation.” Effective November 12, 2009, PLAG
reincorporated in Nevada from Delaware.
The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, including our subsidiaries and our VIEs.
Subsidiary
We are a company that continuously strives to create new value and relentlessly to capture new opportunities, which is why we are growing and
strengthening the internet-based business as another pillar towards the next growth stage. In addition to our Chinese domestic business, we set out
for global market by acquiring 100% shares of Fast Approach in Canada on June 5, 2020 to embark on demand-side platform (DSP) business in
North America. A demand-side platform is a system that allows buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple advertisement exchange
and data exchange through one interface. Fast Approach is the first North America demand side platform that directly connects to Chinese market
without middleman and is supported by world class data science researchers among some well-respected universities in North America. Fast
Approach owns 100% equity of Shanghai Shuning in China. We believe this acquisition will accelerate our global business growth, leading to
further increasing the Planet Green enterprise value as well.
On May 29, 2020, the Planet Green Holdings Corporation (BVI) incorporated Lucky Sky Planet Green Holdings Co., Limited, a limited company
incorporated in Hong Kong. On June 16, 2020, Lucky Sky Holdings Corporations (H.K.) transferred its 100% equity interest in Lucky Sky
Petrochemical to Lucky Sky Planet Green Holdings Co., Limited (H.K.).
On August 10, 2020, as part of the reorganization, Planet Green Holdings Corporation (BVI) transferred its 100% equity interest in Lucky Sky
Holdings Corporations (H.K.) Limited to Rui Tang, a unrelated party, at nominal price.

Production Lines
We currently manufacture our different products using production lines operated through our subsidiaries.
The production process for our cyan brick tea products involves, primary processing of fresh leaves, piling and fermenting, storing and aging,
picking, pressing, and baking. The production process for our black tea products involves selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, withering, rolling,
fermenting, baking and drying, grading according to color, prompting fragrance, packing and warehousing. The production process for our green
tea products involves selecting and sorting the fresh leaves, airing, fixating, cooling, rolling, stir drying, selecting and grading, prompting
fragrance, packing and warehousing.
The production process for our formaldehyde products is illustrated as follows. The raw material methanol, after being injected into the high
position tank, enters the methanol evaporator through the filter, mixes with the air from the roots blower to form the binary mixture, and then adds
steam to form the ternary mixture, which is heated by the superheater to 120 ℃ and enters the oxidizer, carries out oxidation and dehydrogenation
reaction through the silver catalyst to form the formaldehyde gas, and then absorbs the formaldehyde solution through the first absorption tower
and the second absorption tower. The excess waste gas is burned out by the exhaust gas boiler.
The production process for our methyl starting with the raw materials methanol and formaldehyde are pumped into the reaction distillation tower
according to the proportion. At the bottom of the tower, formaldehyde and methanol are indirectly heated by steam. The reaction liquid vapor from
the tower upwards through the catalyst reaction to produce methyl acetal, and then through the distillation tower separation, cooling, the final
product methyl acetal.
The production process for our urea-formaldehyde glue is demonstrated as follows. Formaldehyde is pumped from the formaldehyde workshop into
the tank of formaldehyde storage, and then pumped into the metering tank through the feed pump of formaldehyde. After the PH value is adjusted
by adding alkali, it is sent into the reaction kettle. At the same time, urea is also added into the kettle according to the corresponding proportion,
heating the reaction kettle. After heating up the kettle, melamine is added, so that the material can undergo addition reaction in the kettle. After
the PH value is adjusted by dropping formic acid in the kettle, the material is sent into the condensation kettle through the transfer pump. Urea and
additives are added into the condensation kettle according to a certain proportion for condensation reaction, and the finished product is formed
after cooling treatment.
The production process for our clean fuel oil is illustrated as follows. The self-control design of the facilities for storage of raw materials and
addition of additives shall, in accordance with the requirements of the process, conduct centralized indication and adjustment of the temperature,
flow rate and liquid level of the raw oil tanks, raw oil metering tanks, product oil allocation tanks and finished oil tanks during the fuel blending
process; realize remote monitoring of the whole fuel production process, and conduct on-the-spot indication of pressure and partial flow rate.

Raw Materials
Our Supply Sources
Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various products, including tea, refined methanol, methanol, formaldehyde and polymer
emulsion. Because of the diversity of available sources of these raw materials, we believe that our raw materials are currently in adequate supply.
For our tea operation, we obtain our raw materials primarily from domestic procurement. We purchase approximately 400 tons of tea from
suppliers in 2020. For our business lines of ethanol fuel and fuel additive, we purchased approximately 710 tons of additive material from suppliers
in 2020. For our business lines of formaldehyde, rubber and methylal products, we purchased approximately 18,547 tons of methanol and 146 tons
of urea from suppliers in 2020.
We select suppliers based on price and product quality. We typically rely on numerous domestic suppliers, including some with whom we have a
long-term relationship. Our suppliers generally include wholesale agricultural product companies, food production companies, tea bag processing
companies and chemical products wholesale companies.
Our Customers
Our tea and chemical products are sold exclusively in Chinese domestic markets.
We sell our tea products to third-party distributors, such as trading companies with established distribution channels. The terms of a typical sales
contract between us and our distributors provide that we are responsible for transportation costs and the distributors are responsible for storage
costs. Furthermore, the distributors have the right to return products that fail to satisfy specified quality standards, at our cost. The majority of
such contracts require the distributors to pay us in cash in full upon delivery, and the remaining contracts provide for short-term credit, usually two

Black tea is produced in Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi and Anhui provinces in China. Our black tea products are processed in
our factory in Hubei province and distributed nationwide. There are few large players on the market but we face fierce competition from numerous
small black tea manufactures and distributors. However, as our brand has over hundreds of year’s history, we have accumulated loyal consumers
and gained favorable market reputation over years.
Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety and
ingredients, product packaging and package design, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy
consumer tastes and preferences.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update
Recently, an ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China and has since spread rapidly globally. The
pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities globally for the past few
months. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19
pandemic, and because substantially all of our business operations and workforce are concentrated in China, our business, results of operations,
and financial condition have been and will continue to be adversely affected. Potential impact to the results of our operations will also depend on
future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by
government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
1) The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
2) We temporally closed our offices and production facilities to adhere to the policy from February 2020 until April 2020, as required by
relevant PRC regulatory authorities. Our offices are slowly reopening pursuant to local guidelines. During the past 12 months in the fiscal
year 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused disruptions in our manufacturing operations, which had resulted in delays in the shipment of
products to certain of our customers.
3) Some of our employees were in mandatory self-quarantine from January 2020 to April 2020.
4) Our customers have been negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may reduce the demand for our products. As a result, our revenue and
income have been being negatively impacted in 2020.
5) The situation may worsen if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We will continue to closely monitor our collections throughout 2021.
13

A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations of the manufacturing, delivery, and assembly process within any of our
production facilities could continue to result in delays in the shipment of products to our customers, increased costs, and reduced revenue.
We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the
outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely
affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity, and financial
condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse
effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that
we cannot predict, and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Revenues. Our net revenues amounted to $3.64 million in 2020, representing an increase of approximately $2.53 million, from 2019, in which
our net revenue was $1.11 million. This increase was attributable to the fact that the Company has acquired Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co.,
Ltd in May 2019 and expanded enterprise sales distribution channel in the fiscal year 2020.
Cost of Revenues. In 2020, we experienced an increase in the cost of revenues of $1.91 million compared to 2019, from approximately $0.46 million
to $2.37 million. This soaring in cost of goods sold was in line with the increase in sales in the fiscal year 2020.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit increased by $0.63 million, or 98%, to $1.27 million in 2020 from $0.64 million in 2019, For the years ended
December 31, 2020, and 2019, our overall gross margin was 35% and 58%, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the
reshaping of the brand and the adjustment of the product lines.
Operating Expenses
Selling and Marketing Expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses increased by $0.12 million or 300%, to $0.16 million in 2020, compared to
$0.04 million in 2019. The increase in our selling and marketing expenses is mainly due to the development of new sales channels; it includes the
adjustment of promotion strategies, marketing strategies, and Channel strategies. Specifically, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company began to
engage in online wholesales business.
General and Administrative Expenses. We experienced an increase in general and administrative expenses of $2.99 million from $0.90 million to
approximately $3.90 million in 2020, compared to 2019. The increase was mainly because the Company incurred approximately $1.75million on
stock compensation expense concerning our ordinary shares issued to the management.
Net Income
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, our net loss amounted to approximately $11 million, comparing approximately 3 million net income
in the fiscal year 2019. This decrease in net income was attributable to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the disposal of certain VIEs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash-on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs
are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. In the reporting period in the fiscal year
2020, our primary sources of financing have been cash generated from operations and private placements.
On February 10, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Mengru Xu and Zhichao Du, pursuant to which Mr. Xu and Mr. Du
agreed to invest an aggregate of $3.51 million in the Company in exchange for an aggregate of 1,350,000 shares of our common stock,
representing a purchase price of approximately $2.60 per share.
Management anticipates that our existing capital resources and anticipated cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy our liquidity
requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary capital needs have been to fund our working capital requirements. In the past, our primary
sources of financing have been cash generated from operations and financing activities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of $3.42 million compared to $7.4 million as of December
31, 2019. The debt to assets ratio was 16.7% and 19.9% as of December 31, 2020, and 2019. We expect to continue to finance our operations and
working capital needs in 2021 from cash generated from operations and, if needed, private financings. If available liquidity is not sufficient to meet
our operating and loan obligations as they come due. In that case, our plans include pursuing alternative financing arrangements or reducing
expenditures as necessary to meet our cash requirements.
15

However, there is no assurance that we will raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide liquidity if needed. We cannot be
sure of the availability or terms of any alternative financing arrangements.
The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statement periods presented in this report.

cash provided by financing activities from $13.2 million for the same period of 2019. This is mainly due to repayment to related party and decrease
from proceed from issuance of common stock.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the United States generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to
make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes to that, and related
disclosures of commitments contingencies, if any.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective.
The material weakness and significant deficiency identified by our management as of December 31, 2020, relates to the ability of the Company to
record transactions and provide disclosures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). We
did not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of experience in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with
our financial reporting requirements. For example, our staff members do not hold licenses such as Certified Public Accountant or Certified
Management Accountant in the U.S., have not attended U.S. institutions for training as accountants, and have not attended extended educational
programs that would provide sufficient relevant education relating to U.S. GAAP. Our staff will require substantial training to meet the demands of
a U.S. public company and our staff’s understanding of the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting are inadequate.
Remediation Initiative
We plan to provide U.S. GAAP training sessions to our accounting team. The training sessions will be organized to help our corporate accounting
team gain experience in U.S. GAAP reporting and to enhance their awareness of new and emerging pronouncements with potential impact on our
financial reporting. We plan to continue to recruit experienced and professional accounting and financial personnel and participate in educational
seminars, tutorials, and conferences and employ more qualified accounting staff in the future.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Other than as described above, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were no material changes in our internal control over
financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed during the fiscal year covered by this annual report that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls.
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes under U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements under U.S. GAAP,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only under authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
could affect the financial statements.
Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect our internal controls to prevent or detect all
misstatements. No matter how well designed and operated, a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of such controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of misstatements, if any, have been detected or prevented.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To: The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Planet Green Holdings Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Planet Green Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December
31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill in the Canadian reporting unit
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might exceed its fair value. The discount rate applied to
projected cash flows is important elements used by the Company in determining the fair value of the reporting unit and the amount of goodwill
impairment losses. In the last quarter of 2020, the Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test in response to the decline in current
market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goodwill was determined to be impaired, and impairment losses of $2.34 million was
recorded.
We identified the evaluation of the discount rate applied to projected cash flows used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for the
reporting unit, for which such assumptions are used by the Company in the determination of goodwill impairment losses, as a critical audit matter.
Specifically, the evaluation of these assumptions required the application of subjective auditor judgment because changes to these assumptions
may have a substantial impact on the determination of fair value of the reporting unit. We gathered data and evidence to performed sensitivity
analyses to determine the significance of the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, which required a higher degree of
auditor judgment.
Addressing the matter involved evaluating the Company’s assessment of the value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method. We
gathered data and evidence, performed independent analysis, and exercised professional judgment during our evaluation process.

F-8

term of each Voting Rights Proxy Agreement is 20 years. WOFE has the right to extend each Voting Proxy Agreement by giving written
notification.
Use of estimates
The financial statements’ preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available when the calculations are made;
however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investment securities
The Company classifies securities it holds for investment purposes into trading or available-for-sale. Trading securities are bought and held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. All deposits not included in trading securities are classified as available-for-sale.
F-9

Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in the net
income. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available for sale securities are excluded from net income. They are
reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities are determined on a specific identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in
carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged as an expense to the statement of income and comprehensive income, and a new cost
basis for the security is established. To determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the
ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and believes whether evidence indicating the cost of the asset is recoverable
outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of
the impairment, changes in value after year-end, and forecasted performance of the investee.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield using the
effective-interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful
accounts is made when the collection of the total amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods, stated at the lower of cost or market value. Finished goods are comprised of direct
materials, direct labor, inbound shipping costs, and allocated overhead. The Company applies the weighted average cost method to its inventory.
Advances and prepayments to suppliers
The Company makes an advance payment to suppliers and vendors for the procurement of raw materials. Upon physical receipt and inspection of
the raw materials from suppliers, the applicable amount is reclassified from advances and prepayments to suppliers to inventory.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method. The Company typically applies a salvage value of 0% to 10%. The estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as
follows:
Buildings 20-40 years
Landscaping, plant, and tree 30 years
Machinery and equipment 1-10 years
Motor vehicles 5-10 years
Office equipment 5-20 years
The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are
included in the Company’s results of operations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized as incurred; significant renewals and
betterments are capitalized.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided over their useful lives, using the straight-line method.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:
Land use rights 50 years
Software licenses 2 years
Trademarks 10 years
F-10

Construction in progress and prepayments for equipment
Construction in progress and prepayments for equipment represent direct and indirect acquisition and construction costs for plants and fees of
purchase and installation of related equipment. Amounts classified as construction in progress and prepayments for equipment are transferred to
plant and equipment when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use are completed. Depreciation is not
provided for assets classified in this account.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. The
Company conducts an annual assessment of its goodwill for impairment. If the carrying value of its goodwill exceeds its fair value, then impairment
has incurred; accordingly, a charge to the Company’s operations results will be recognized during the period. Impairment losses on goodwill are
not reversed. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted expected future cash flow analysis. In 2020, the Company recorded
approximately $2.34 million in impairment to its Canadian operating units Fast Approach. Fast Approach’s main business is operated in China in
which were materially adversely impacted by the COVID 19 virus.
Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets
The Company annually reviews its long-lived assets for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of assets may not be recoverable. Impairment may become obsolete from a difference in the industry, introduction of new technologies, or
if the Company has inadequate working capital to utilize the long-lived assets to generate adequate profits. Impairment is present if the carrying
amount of an asset is less than its expected future undiscounted cash flows.
If an asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported lower the carrying amount or fair value fewer costs to selling.
Statutory reserves
Statutory reserves are referring to the amount appropriated from the net income following laws or regulations, which can be used to recover losses
and increase capital, as approved, and are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that an enterprise operating at a
profit must appropriate and reserve, on an annual basis, an amount equal to 10% of its profit. Such an appropriation is necessary until the reserve
reaches a maximum that is equal to 50% of the enterprise’s PRC registered capital.
Foreign currency translation
The accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The functional currency of the Company is the Renminbi (RMB). The
Company’s assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars from RMB at year-end exchange rates. Its revenues and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital
transactions occurred.
12/31/2020 12/31/2019
Period-end US$: CDN$ exchange rate 1.2754 1.2988
Period-end US$: RMB exchange rate 6.5326 6.9762
Period average US$: CDN$ exchange rate 1.3409 1.3269
Period average US$: RMB exchange rate 6.8996 6.8967
The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies, and all foreign exchange transactions must be conducted through authorized financial
institutions.
Revenue recognition
The Company adopted ASC 606 “Revenue Recognition” and recognized revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to
customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company derives its revenues from selling fresh foods, spices, convenience foods, and tea products. The Company applies the following five
steps to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:
● identify the contract with a customer;
● identify the performance obligations in the contract;
F-11

● determine the transaction price;
● allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
● Recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
Advertising
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Shipping and handling
All outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits in the form of mandatory government-sponsored defined contribution plans are charged to either expense as incurred or
allocated to inventory as part of overhead.
Stock-based compensation
The Company records stock compensation expense for employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense one time because
there is no employee’s requisite service period requirement. On December 30, 2020, 782,165 shares of common stocks are granted to six
employees of the Company for stock compensation. The closing stock price on December 30, 2020 is $2.25 per share. Total amount of $1,759,871
are recorded as stock compensation expenses.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income tax using an asset and liability approach and recognizes deferred tax benefits in future years. Under the asset
and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets.
If it is more likely than not, these items will either expire before the Company can realize their benefits or that future realization is uncertain.
Comprehensive income
The Company uses Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC Topic 220, “Reporting Comprehensive Income.” Comprehensive income is
comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders’ equity, except the changes in paid-in capital and distributions to
stockholders due to investments by stockholders.
Earnings per share
The Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) following ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per share.” Basic EPS is measured as the income or loss
available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive
effect on a per-share basis from the potential conversion of convertible securities or the exercise of options and or warrants; the dilutive impacts of
potentially convertible securities are calculated using the as-if method; the potentially dilutive effect of options or warranties are computed using
the treasury stock method. Securities that are potentially an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per
share) are excluded from diluted EPS calculation.
F-12

Financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts and other payables, accrued
liabilities, and short-term debt, have carrying amounts that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosing the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial
Instruments,” defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances
disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current
liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period between the
origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are
defined as follows:
● Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology used quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
● Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and information
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the financial instrument’s full term.
● Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,”
and ASC 815.
Commitments and contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax
Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update affect any entity required to apply the provisions of Topic
220, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income and has items of other comprehensive income for which the related tax effects are
presented in other comprehensive income required by GAAP. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted, including
adoption in any interim period, (1) for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2)
for all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not however been made available for issuance. The amendments in
this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the
U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU would
affect the Company’s financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), – Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which makes several changes meant to add, modify or remove specific disclosure requirements
associated with the movement amongst or hierarchy associated with Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this
Update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements based on the concepts in FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting—Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The amendments
on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value
measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or
annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon
their effective date. The modifications are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption, permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on the
Company’s condensed financial statements.
The Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company’s balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of cash flows.

4. Variable interest entity (“VIE”)
A VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as through voting rights,
right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity. If any, the variable interest
holder that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. PLAG WOFE is
deemed to have the controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary of Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd because it has both of
the following characteristics:
1) The power to direct activities at Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd that most significantly impact such entity’s economic
performance, and
2) The obligation to absorb losses of, and the right to receive benefits from Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd that could potentially
be significant to such entity.
Pursuant to the Contractual Arrangements, Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd pays service fees equal to all of its net income to PLAG
WFOE. At the same time, PLAG WFOE is obligated to absorb all of Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd’s losses. The Contractual
Arrangements are designed so that Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd operate for the benefit of PLAG WFOE and ultimately, the Company.
Accordingly, the accounts of Xianning Bozhuang Tea Products Co., Ltd are consolidated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In
addition, its financial positions and results of operations are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

18. Risks
A. Credit risk
The Company’s deposits are made with banks located in the PRC. They do not carry federal deposit insurance and may be subject to loss
of the banks become insolvent.
Since the Company’s inception, the age of account receivables has been less than one year indicating that the Company is subject to
minimal risk borne from credit extended to customers.
B. Interest risk
The Company is subject to interest rate risk when short term loans become due and require refinancing.
C. Economic and political risks
The Company’s operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations
may be influenced by changes in the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC.
The Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies
in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment
and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the
PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion,
remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
D. Environmental risks
The Company has procured environmental licenses required by the PRC government. The Company has both a water treatment facility
for water used in its production process and secure transportation to remove waste off site. In the event of an accident, the Company has
purchased insurance to cover potential damage to employees, equipment, and local environment.
E. Inflation Risk
Management monitors changes in prices levels. Historically inflation has not materially impacted the Company’s financial statements;
however, significant increases in the price of raw materials and labor that cannot be passed to the Company’s customers could adversely
impact the Company’s results of operations.

has allocated the purchase price of Jilin Chuangyuan based upon the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the
acquisition date. The Company estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities taken at the acquisition date following the business
combination standard issued by the FASB with the valuation methodologies using level 3 inputs, except for other current assets and current
liabilities were valued using the cost approach. Management of the Company is responsible for determining the fair value of assets acquired,
liabilities assumed, and intangible assets identified as of the acquisition date and considered several other available factors. Acquisition-related
costs incurred for the acquisitions are not material and expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses.
