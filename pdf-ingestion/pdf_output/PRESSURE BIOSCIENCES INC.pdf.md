ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a leader in the development and sale of innovative, broadly enabling, high pressure-based platform technologies and related
consumables for the worldwide life sciences, agriculture, cosmetics, food and beverage, and other key industries. Our solutions are based on the
unique properties of both constant (i.e., static) and alternating (i.e., Pressure Cycling Technology, or “PCT”) hydrostatic pressure. PCT is a patented
enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly
control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., cell lysis, biomolecule extraction). Historically, our primary focus has been in the development of PCT-
based products for biomarker and target discovery, drug design and development, biotherapeutics characterization and quality control, soil & plant
biology, forensics, and counter-bioterror applications. In more recent years, major new market opportunities have emerged in the use of our
pressure-based technologies in the following areas: (1) the use of our recently acquired, patented technology from BaroFold, Inc. (the “BaroFold”
technology platform) to allow entry into the bio-pharma contract services sector, and (2) the use of our recently-patented, scalable, high-efficiency,
pressure-based Ultra Shear Technology (“UST”) platform to (i) create stable nanoemulsions of otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water),to
(ii) prepare higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be acceptably preserved
using existing non-thermal technologies and (iii), in some cases, improve the bioavailability of some poorly absorbed oils. Because of the significant
market opportunity presented by UST, the Company has shifted its predominant efforts in commercializing this revolutionary platform.
On February 8, 2021, PBI announced plans to acquire the assets of a global eco-friendly agrochemical supplier. This opportunity is attractive as
it has the potential of readily producing significant revenue, as well as the potential to apply the UST technology to improve some of the product
line. In July 2021, a newly-formed subsidiary of PBI, PBI Agrochem, leased a warehouse in Sparks, NV, and hired a warehouse manager. See the
further description of this possible transaction in Item 1 – Business – “The PBI Agrochem Platform.”
The reestablishment of previous business relationships and sales channels proceeded much more slowly during late 2021 than had been
forecast by the management of the dormant agrochemicals company. As much of the historical business had been generated in California, the four-
year drought conditions presented significant challenges throughout the 2022 year. The management of the dormant agrochemicals company
continues to forecast an accelerating reestablishment of its previous customer base and sales, and robust global growth opportunities for its highly
desirable “green” agrochemical product solutions. PBI is continuing to evaluate these agrochemical assets and the asset acquisition opportunity.
The widely publicized rainfalls occurring throughout the West present both an opportunity that the drought is coming to an end as well as threat
that flooded fields will be challenging to plant.

The PCT Platform
a. Description
The instruments, consumables and software used to perform PCT (the “PCT Platform”) use alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between
ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., critical steps performed by hundreds of thousands
of scientists worldwide, such as cell lysis and biomolecule extraction). Our primary focus is in making our recently released, GMP-compliant, next
generation PCT-based Barocycler 2320 EXT instrument available globally to biopharmaceutical drug manufacturers to accelerate biologics
development by streamlining workflows for the design, development, characterization and quality control of biotherapeutic drugs. The PCT
Platform is also used in such areas as biomarker and target discovery, soil & plant biology, anti-bioterror, and forensics. We currently have
hundreds of PCT instrument systems placed in approximately 200 academic, government, pharmaceutical, and biotech research laboratories
worldwide. There are over 120 independent, peer-reviewed publications highlighting the advantages of using the PCT Platform in scientific
research studies, many from key opinion leaders worldwide. The PCT Platform is offered through the Company’s Research Products & Services
Group.
We are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists
worldwide working in biological life sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most
forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific
research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking – the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market.
We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology platform that offers revolutionary speed and reproducible control in the sample
preparation process, while revealing a far greater diversity and abundance of detectable unique analytes. It is based on harnessing the unique
properties of high hydrostatic pressure. This process, which we refer to as Pressure Cycling Technology, or PCT, uses alternating cycles of
hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e., 20,000 psi or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of
molecules in biological samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.
PCT is an enabling platform technology based on a physical process that had not previously been used to control bio-molecular interactions.
PCT uses unique instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific
time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio-molecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules. Our
laboratory instrument family, the Barocycler, and our proprietary consumables product line, which include our unique MicroTubes, MicroCaps,
MicroPestles, and PULSE (Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction) Tubes, and application specific kits (containing consumable products and
reagents), together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System (the “PCT SPS”).
In 2015, together with an investment bank, we formed a subsidiary called Pressure BioSciences Europe (“PBI Europe”) in Poland. We have 49%
non-controlling ownership interest with the investment bank retaining 51%. As a result of subsequent changes in the Polish government, initial
plans for PBI Europe have not been pursued. Throughout 2021, PBI Europe did not have any operating activities and we cannot reasonably predict
when operations will commence.
Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as
one of the key parts of sample preparation. The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies
includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting biomolecules such as nucleic acid i.e., DNA
and/or RNA, as well as proteins, lipids, or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. Our current PCT sales
and marketing efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution for sample extraction when compared
to other available technologies or procedures, and thus might significantly improve the quality and efficiency of sample preparation and subsequent
test result.
Within the broad field of biological sample preparation, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant pressure (“CP”) product development
efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery, precision medicine and forensics. We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based
instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid,
versatile, reproducible and more complete extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from a wide variety of plant, animal, and
microbiological cells and tissues.
Biomarker Discovery and Precision Medicine
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for long-term storage and subsequent pathology
evaluation is to process them into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) samples. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is
highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule
recovery, and safety.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 5

Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and
other life science institutions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue market penetration in these target
areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional laboratories at
current customer institutions.
b. Market
We focus most of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation and quality control analysis for genomic,
proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies. This market is comprised of academic and government research institutions, biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies, and other public and private laboratories that are engaged in studying genomic, proteomic and small molecule
biomarkers within plant and animal cells and tissues. We elected to initially focus our resources on the market of genomic, proteomic and small
molecule sample preparation because we believe it is an area that:
● is a rapidly growing market;
● has a large and immediate need for better technology;
● is comprised mostly of research laboratories, which are subject to minimal governmental regulation;
● is the least technically challenging application for the development of our products;
● is compatible with our technical core competency; and
● we currently have strong patent protection.
We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the
sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and more complete extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules
from a wide variety of plant and animal cells and tissues.
Biomarker Discovery - Mass Spectrometry
A biomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used as an indicator of the presence or absence of a particular disease-state or
condition, and/or to predict or measure the progression and effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy selection
and monitoring, prevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions.
A mass spectrometer is a laboratory instrument used in the analysis of biological samples, often focused on proteins, in life sciences research. It
is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to the November 2017 published market report by Markets and Markets “Mass
Spectrometry Market by Application (Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Environmental testing), Platform (Single mass spectrometry (Quadrupole,
TOF & Ion Trap), Hybrid mass spectrometry (Triple Quadrupole, QTOF & FTMS)) – Global Forecast to 2022, the global mass spectrometry market
is expected to grow from USD $3.44 billion in 2016 to USD $5.27 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2016 to 2020. We believe PCT and CP-
based products offer significant advantages in speed, reproducibility, and quality completeness of results, compared with current techniques used
in the preparation of samples for mass spectrometry analysis.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 6

Biomarker Discovery – Precision Medicine
Precision medicine is an approach to patient care that allows doctors to select treatments that are most likely to help patients based on a
specific biomolecular understanding of their disease. The goal of precision medicine is to facilitate selection and/or development of treatments are
tailored to the unique biomolecular variations specific to each person’s disease.
A significant roadblock in obtaining necessary information to advance precision medicine – specifically in proteogenomics, is sample
preparation and the time required using conventional methods. We believe our PCT workflows address this roadblock by providing a rapid,
reproducible means of extracting biomarkers from patient samples in a clinically relevant timeframe of 2 hours.
Biomarker Discovery – Cancer and Tumor Microenvironment
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for subsequent pathology evaluation is formalin-
fixation followed by paraffin-embedding, or FFPE. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT
offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety.
Biopharmaceutical Quality Control
A critical step in biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes is quality control, involving characterization of the resulting biotherapeutics via
peptide mapping and analysis of post-translational modifications. Peptide mapping can be used in drug discovery and throughout the
manufacturing process for quality control between batches to produce a unique ‘fingerprint’ of an individual protein and to compare this with the
theoretical gene-derived amino acid sequence. Using conventional methods this process can take overnight or more. We believe our PCT workflows
offer a significant advantage to this process by offering a significant reduction in time and improvement in reproducibility with a GMP compliant
platform. Many protein-based pharmaceuticals undergo specific enzymatic and chemical modifications (such as glycosylation, when specific
carbohydrate moieties, glycans, are attached to the protein core, thus helping them remain active longer in the patient’s bloodstream). Like peptide
mapping, analysis of glycans, also critical quality attributes of biologic drugs, requires tedious sample preparation steps that can be significantly
accelerated and rendered more reproducible by PCT workflows.
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and
other life science institutions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration in
these target areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional
laboratories within current customer organizations.
Sample Extraction Process
The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic and small molecule studies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample
disruption. This is the process of extracting nucleic acid i.e., DNA and/or RNA, proteins or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and
tissues that are being studied. Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction
is generally regarded as one of the key parts of sample preparation. Our current commercialization efforts are based upon our belief that pressure
cycling technology provides a superior solution to sample extraction compared with other available technologies or procedures and can thus
significantly improve the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result.
c. Products
We believe our PCT and CP products allow researchers to improve scientific research studies in the life sciences field. Our products are
developed with the expectation of meeting or exceeding the needs of research scientists while enhancing the safety, speed and quality that is
available to them with existing sample preparation methods.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 7

Barocycler Instrumentation
Our Barocycler product line consists of laboratory instrumentation that subjects a sample to cycles of pressure from ambient (approximately
14.5 psi) to ultra-high levels (20,000 psi or much greater) and then back to ambient, in a precisely controlled manner.
Our instruments (the Barocycler 2320EXT, the HUB440 and the HUB880) use cycles of high, hydrostatic pressure to quickly and efficiently
break up the cellular structures of a specimen to release proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and small molecules from the specimen into our consumable
processing tubes, referred to as our PULSE Tubes and MicroTubes. Our instruments have temperature control options (on-board heating via
internal heating jacket or heating and chilling via an external circulating water or oil bath), automatic fill and dispensing valves, and an integrated
touchscreen for interfacing with an onboard micro-processor or computer. The microprocessor, computer or laptop computer are capable of saving
specific PCT protocols, so the researcher can achieve maximum reproducibility for the preparation of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or small
molecules from various biological samples. Our Barocycler instruments, consumable products and application specific kits make up our PCT Sample
Preparation System.
Barocycler 2320EXTREME - The Barocycler 2320EXT is the flagship of the Company’s Barocycler line of PCT-based instruments. It weighs
approximately 80lbs, delivers a maximum pressure of 45,000 psi, and can process either up to 16 MicroTubes simultaneously. The working
temperature range is 4 – 95ºC and is controlled via an on-board electric heating jacket or external circulating bath. All tests are entered and
recorded on a touch screen interface. Information from each test run (pressure profile, cycle number, and temperature) is recorded and can be
stored on the instrument, on a USB drive, or networked into the user’s lab computer system. Pressure profiles can be manipulated in a number of
ways, including static high pressure holds and pressure ramp programs. The Barocycler 2320EXT is pneumatic and requires an input air source of
only 100psi to achieve and cycle at high pressure.
The Barocycler 2320EXT was developed to support the PCT-HD/PCT-SWATH application. PCT-HD enables faster, less cumbersome and higher
quality processing of biopsy tissues. With homogenization, extraction, and digestion of proteins occurring in a single PCT MicroTube under high
pressure, this protocol can yield analytical results in under four hours from the start of tissue processing. PCT-HD was developed by our scientists
and engineers in collaboration with Professor Ruedi Aebersold and Dr. Tiannan Guo of the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, and
the University of Zurich, in Switzerland. Drs. Aebersold and Guo combined PCT-HD with SCIEX’s SWATH-Mass Spectrometry – calling the resulting
method “PCT-SWATH”.
Barocycler HUB440 –We believe the Barocycler HUB440 is the first portable, ready to use, “plug-and-play” high pressure generator for the
laboratory bench. The Barocycler HUB440 is capable of creating and controlling hydrostatic pressure from 500 psi to 58,000 psi and is designed for
easy and flexible interfacing with a wide variety of user-specified pressure vessels. It is computer controlled and runs on software that was
developed by us to allow data logging and sophisticated algorithms for controlling pressure and temperature. We own the rights and have a license
to use the specialty LabVIEW software. We believe that over the coming years, the Barocycler HUB440 may become one of the main products in
our pressure-based instrument line.
Barocycler HUB880 - The Barocycler HUB880 is a compact, portable, bench-top, ultra-high pressure generator with vessel interface flexibility
similar to the HUB440, that uses an air pressure-to-liquid pressure intensifier allowing the user to generate fluid pressure as high as 90,000 psi
with input air pressure of just 126 psi. The HUB880 can be operated through a simple front panel or controlled using an optional external Data
Acquisition and Control Module for dynamic pressure control. We believe that the HUB880 will be well accepted by scientists that need to achieve
super high pressure, such as those working in the life science research, food safety and vaccine industries.
The Shredder SG3 –The Shredder SG3 is a low shear mechanical homogenization system for use with tough, fibrous and other difficult-to-disrupt
tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 System uses a variety of Shredder PULSE Tubes to directly and rapidly grind a biological sample which,
when combined with selected buffers, can provide effective extraction of proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules from tissues and
organisms. The Shredder SG3 is also used to isolate intact and functional mitochondria from tissues. The Shredder SG3 features a three-position
force setting lever, which enables the operator to select and apply reproducible force to the sample during the shredding process and eliminates
the need for the operator to exert force for long periods when processing one or more samples.
Barocycler Consumable Products
PCT MicroTubes – PCT MicroTubes are made from a unique fluoropolymer, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). FEP is highly inert and retains its
integrity within an extremely wide temperature range (-200°C to 100°C), while providing important limited flexibility behavior for PCT applications.
MicroTubes hold a maximum total volume of 150 microliters. PCT MicroTubes must be used with either PCT-MicroCaps or PCT-MicroPestles.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 8

PCT-MicroCaps – PCT MicroCaps are made from polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). The PCT MicroCaps are available in three sizes to accommodate
total sample volume: 50, 100 and 150uL. 50uL MicroCaps are used with samples ≤50uL, 100uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 50-
100uL, and 150uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 100-150uL.
PCT-Micro Pestle - PCT μPestles are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, also known as
Teflon (by DuPont Co). PTFE is practically inert; the only chemicals known to affect it are certain alkali metals and most highly reactive fluorinating
agents. PCT μPestles, in conjunction with PCT MicroTubes, are designed to enhance the extraction of proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and small
molecules from minute amounts (0.5 – 3.0 mg) of solid tissue in extraction reagent volumes as low as 20-30 μL. PCT MicroTubes and PCT μPestles
use PCT to effectively disrupt soft tissues and lyse their cells. As a result, the tissue sample trapped between the MicroTube walls and the μPestles
shaft is crushed on every pressure cycle. This mechanical action, combined with the extraction ability of the buffer under high pressure, results in
highly effective tissue homogenization and extraction.
PCT μPestles and PCT MicroTubes, together with a PBI Barocycler, comprise the PCT Micro-Pestle System, which provides a fast, safe, and
efficient means of extraction from extremely small amounts of solid samples such as soft tissue biopsies. The PCT μPestle System can be used in
any PBI Barocycler.
We believe our development of these various consumable products has helped, and will continue to help, drive the adoption of PCT within the life
sciences market.
d. Competition
We compete with companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from cells
and tissues, including methods such as mortar and pestle grinding, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French Press, bead beating, freezer
milling, enzymatic digestion, and chemical dissolution. We believe that there are a number of significant issues related to the use of these methods,
including: complexity, sample containment, cross-contamination, shearing of biomolecules of interest, limited applicability to different sample
types, ease-of-use, reproducibility, and cost. We believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System offers a number of significant advantages over
these methods, including:
● labor reduction ● versatility
● temperature control ● efficiency
● precision ● simplicity
● reproducibility ● safety
● analyte diversity ● analyte abundance
To be competitive in the industry, we believe we must be able to clearly and conclusively demonstrate to potential customers that our products
provide these improved performance capabilities. We strongly believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System is a novel and enabling system for
genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation. As such, many users of current manual techniques will need to be willing to challenge
their existing methods of sample preparation and invest time to evaluate a method that could change their overall workflow in the sample
preparation process, prior to adopting our technology.
Further, we are aware that the cost of the PCT Sample Preparation System may be greater than the cost of many of the other methods currently
employed. Consequently, we are focusing our sales efforts on those product attributes that we believe will be most important and appealing to
potential customers; namely speed, versatility, analyte diversity and abundance, reproducibility, quality, and safety.
e. Manufacturing and Supply
We currently manufacture and assemble the Barocycler 2320EXT, Barocycler HUB440, HUB880, the SHREDDER SG3, and most of our
consumables at our South Easton, MA facility. We will regularly reassess the tradeoffs between in-house assembly versus the benefits of outsourced
relationships for of the entire Barocycler product line, and future instruments.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 9

We utilize a few contract manufacturers of certain parts for our Barocycler product line. They provide us with precision manufacturing services
to meet our specific application and operational requirements.
At this time, we believe that this approach is the most cost-effective method for us to produce and market ISO Certified, CE and CSA Marked
instruments.
f. Research and Development
Our research and development activities are split into two functional areas: Applications Development and Engineering.
1. Applications Development R&D: Our highly educated and trained staff has years of experience in molecular and cellular biology, virology,
and proteomics. Our team of scientists focuses on the development and continued improvement of the PCT Sample Preparation System and
on PCT-dependent genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation applications. Dr. Alexander Lazarev, our Chief
Science Officer, meets regularly with our sales, marketing, and engineering staff to discuss market needs and trends. Our applications
research and development team is responsible for the technical review of all scientific collaborations, for the support of our marketing and
sales departments through the generation of internal data in a number of areas of market interest, and in the development of commercially-
viable PCT-dependent products.
2. Engineering R&D: Our engineering research and development team is focused on the design and development of new and improved
instrumentation and consumable products to support the commercialization of PCT. Our engineering department is led by Dr. Edmund Ting,
our Senior Vice President of Engineering. The primary focus of our engineering group is to develop and continually improve our line of PCT-
based instruments and consumables, ensure seamless production processes, help perform installations and field service, and work with our
application scientists to enhance our PCT-based systems for the mass spectrometry and other markets.
Collaboration Program
Our Collaboration Program is an important element of our business strategy. Initiating a collaboration with a researcher involves the
installation of a Barocycler instrument for an agreed upon period of time of approximately three to twelve months, a financial commitment that is
beneficial to both the collaborator and PBI, and the execution of an agreed upon work plan. Our primary objectives for entering into a collaboration
agreement include:
● the development of a new application for PCT and CP in sample preparation;
● the advancement and validation of our understanding of PCT and CP within an area of life sciences in which we already offer products;
● the demonstration of the effectiveness of PCT and CP by specific research scientists, particularly Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”), who we
believe can have a positive impact on market acceptance of PCT; and
● the expectation of peer-reviewed publications and/or presentations at scientific meetings by a third party, especially a KOL, on the merits of
PCT and CP.
Since we initiated our collaboration program, third party researchers have cited the use of our PCT platform in over 120 peer-reviewed
publications and dozens of scientific presentations. We believe that this program has provided and continues to provide us with independent and
objective data about PCT from well-respected laboratories in the United States and throughout the rest of the world. We believe this program has
been responsible for the sale of multiple Barocycler instruments over the past few years and will continue to help to increase the sales of
instrument systems in the future.

Other Fields of Use and Applications for PCT
Our research and development efforts have shown that, in addition to genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation,
PCT is potentially beneficial in several other areas of the life sciences, including pathogen inactivation, protein purification, control of chemical
(particularly enzymatic) reactions, and immunodiagnostics. Other applications in the sample preparation market include forensics and histology, as
discussed above. Our pursuit of these markets, however, depends on several factors, including our success in commercializing PCT in the area of
sample preparation, our judgment regarding the investment required to be successful in these areas, the value of these markets to PBI, and the
availability of sufficient financial resources. Below is a brief explanation of each of these additional potential applications and a short description of
why we believe PCT can be used to improve scientific studies in these areas.
Protein Purification
Many vaccines and drugs are comprised of proteins. These proteins need to be purified from complex mixtures as part of the manufacturing
process. Current purification techniques often result in the loss of a significant amount of the protein. Therefore, any method that could increase
the amount of protein being recovered in the purification step, could subsequently lead to a reduction in cost to the manufacturer. We believe we
have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current purification procedures, a
process that uses PCT has the potential to increase protein recovery, increase the quality of the product, and lower production costs. We have been
issued U.S. patents in this area.
Pathogen Inactivation
Biological products intended for human use, such as blood, vaccines and drugs, are put through rigorous processing protocols in an effort to
minimize the potential of that product to transmit disease. These protocols may include methods to remove infectious materials such as pre-
processing testing, filtration or chromatography, or methods to inactivate infectious agents that are not captured in the removal steps such as
pasteurization, irradiation and solvent detergent inactivation. Notwithstanding current diligence in both the removal and inactivation steps,
significant concern remains that some pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, spores) capable of transmitting infection to recipients may not be removed
or inactivated with current procedures. In addition, some removal and inactivation methods may not be useful because of cost, safety, ease-of-use
or other practical concerns. To that end, we believe that a superior inactivation method is needed that can safely, rapidly and inexpensively
inactivate pathogens in blood, vaccines and drugs without the need for chemical or other potentially toxic additives. We have successfully
generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current procedures, a process that uses PCT has the
potential to increase safety and yield, lower cost and decrease the potential side effects of current methods. We have been issued U.S. patents for
this PCT-dependent inactivation technology.
Control of Chemical (Particularly Enzymatic) Reactions
Chemical reactions encompass many important interactions in nature. Methods used to control chemical reactions could have a positive effect
on the quality, speed, and overall result of the reaction. The control and detection of chemical reactions is particularly useful in the biotechnology
field for synthesizing and characterizing such molecules as nucleic acids and polypeptides. We believe that PCT offers distinct advantages in
controlling chemical reactions over current methods, since PCT can provide precise, automated control over the timing and synchronization of
chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic reactions. We have been issued U.S patents in this area.
Immunodiagnostics
Many tests used in the clinical laboratory today are based on the formation of a complex between two proteins, such as an antigen and an
antibody. Such “immunodiagnostic” methods are used for the detection of infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”),
hepatitis viruses, West Nile virus, and others, as well as for endocrine, drug testing and cancer diagnostics. We have generated proof-of-concept
that PCT may be used to control biomolecular interactions between proteins, such as antigens and antibodies. We believe this capability may
provide a greater degree of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy in immunodiagnostic testing than that offered by methods that are available today.
We have been issued U.S. patents in this area.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 11

Extended Service Contracts
We offer extended service contracts on our laboratory instrumentation to all of our customers. These service contracts allow a customer who
purchases a Barocycler instrument to receive on-site scheduled preventative maintenance, on-site repair and replacement of all worn or defective
component parts, and telephone support, all at no incremental cost for the life of the service contract. We offer one-year and four-year extended
service contracts to customers who purchase Barocycler instruments.
The BaroFold Platform
a. Description
The need for the efficient production of recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals has grown rapidly and demand for them will continue to grow
because of their high specificity and efficacy. Protein drugs are being manufactured via expression in a variety of host organisms. With the rapid
growth in biosimilars (less expensive versions of popular biopharmaceuticals that are manufactured and marketed after the expiration of the
original patents), protein expression in bacteria is beginning to play a major role in this industry, particularly when the biological activity of the
protein product is not dependent on post-translational modifications that only occur in more complex organisms.
Overexpression of proteins in bacteria often results in the accumulation of the protein product in inactive insoluble deposits inside the cells,
called inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies protect the protein of interest from degradation and present a simple and convenient ways to extract and
purify it. Moreover, if the protein of interest is toxic or lethal to the host cell, then inclusion body expression may be the only available production
method. However, the challenge of protein production in bacterial systems most often lies in conversion of inactive and misfolded proteins in the
inclusion bodies into soluble, properly folded bioactive products. This conversion process is called protein refolding.
Traditional methods of protein refolding rely on using high concentrations of chemical denaturants and detergents to unfold misshapen
proteins, and to disentangle and dissolve inactive aggregated proteins and to dissolve them, followed by up to 100-fold dilution or dialysis to
remove interfering chemicals and then letting the proteins refold into their desired active forms. Since chemically-driven unfolding is harsh, it
tends to destroy most of the tertiary (folding) protein structure, some of which could be beneficial for subsequent refolding. Moreover, dilution- or
dialysis-based methods take a long time and produce very low yields of refolded protein, while most of the unfolded protein material tends to get
lost into irreversible aggregation. Overall, traditional refolding methods are usually inefficient, include multiple costly steps and have very low
recovery yields. Pressure-mediated disaggregation and unfolding and refolding of proteins offers an attractive pathway for achieving much higher
yields of correctly folded proteins with desired efficaciousness, produced at much lower cost, versus traditional chemically driven methodologies.
Acquisition of BaroFold’s PreEMT™ high-pressure protein refolding technology in December 2017
Our acquisition of the assets of BaroFold, Inc. have significantly increased PBI’s intellectual property portfolio in high-pressure technologies
with the addition of eight issued and several pending patents. These patents give PBI the ability to operate in several important areas for biologics
research and manufacturing: protein folding, re-folding and disaggregation. The patents also provide PBI the right to grant licenses to third parties
to practice the BaroFold technology in both research laboratories and in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
Biopharmaceutical products are typically large-molecule protein therapeutics produced via complex biological manufacturing processes that
can result in undesirable protein misfolding and aggregation outcomes. Misfolded or aggregated proteins typically lack therapeutic activity and can
present health risks to patients, requiring robust remediation within pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The BaroFold technology improves
the quality of manufacturing, decreases manufacturing costs (as much as $2-10M/year per commercial biologic drug), and facilitates achievement
of proper activity from difficult-to-manufacture proteins.
BaroFold technology utilizes high pressure instead of, or in synergy with, chemical denaturants, offering significantly milder conditions for
unfolding and disaggregation of proteins in inclusion bodies. As a result, subsequent refolding can be carried out faster, more efficiently, and in
much smaller volumes. Pressure-based unfolding of proteins in inclusion bodies tends to only partially unfold the protein and preserve some
beneficial structures that could help to guide the refolding process into the desired outcomes. Consequently, higher yields of active protein and
faster manufacturing turn-around further lower the cost of biopharmaceutical production. Moreover, lower requirements for harsh chemical
reagents in high pressure refolding processing result in the decrease or elimination of associated hazardous waste generated from chemical
removal processes, leading to further cost reduction and protection of the environment.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 12

The instruments, consumables and software used to practice the BaroFold technology (the “BaroFold Platform”) can be used to significantly
lower the cost, boost production yield, and improve the quality of protein therapeutics. It employs high pressure for the disaggregation and
controlled refolding of proteins to their native structures at yields and efficiencies not achievable using existing technologies. The BaroFold
Platform has been shown to remove protein aggregates in biotherapeutic drug manufacturing, thereby improving product efficacy and safety for
both new-drug entities and biosimilar products. The BaroFold Platform can help companies create novel protein therapeutics, accelerate
therapeutic protein development, manufacture follow-on biologics, and significantly optimize life-cycle management of protein therapeutics. It is
scalable and practical for standard manufacturing processes. This unique technology platform can help protein-based biopharmaceutical companies
create and manufacture high quality, novel protein therapeutics and lower the cost of existing formulations. Research and manufacturing licenses
are available.
b. Market
According to a report entitled “Pharmaceutical market: worldwide revenue 2001-2022 by Matej Mikulic published on February 3, 2023, “the
global pharmaceutical market has experienced significant growth in recent years. For 2022, the total global pharmaceutical market was estimated
at 1.48 trillion U.S. dollars.”
We believe that biopharmaceuticals offer several benefits, such as highly effective and potent action, fewer side effects, and the potential to
actually cure diseases rather than merely reduce disease burden or treat the symptoms, which have significantly increased the demand for
biopharmaceutical products.
The predominant majority of biopharmaceutical products are recombinant proteins. Typical examples of such proteins are vaccines, monoclonal
antibodies (MAbs), growth factors (such as Erythropoietin), hormones (such as insulin or HGH), receptor ligands, recombinant enzymes (Caspase,
Cathepsin, etc.), blood factors and other therapeutic and research reagent proteins. Recombinant protein production can be done in bacteria or in
cell cultures derived from higher organisms. Due to significant time and cost savings, attention to protein production in bacterial hosts has recently
spiked, predominantly driven by rapid growth of biosimilars, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and fusion proteins that are lethal to non-bacterial
host cells. A major area of challenge in the biopharmaceuticals industry results from suboptimal folding configurations and/or agglomeration of
proteins during production and storage, requiring subsequent remediation via unfolding and controlled refolding of these therapeutic proteins into
their optimal configurations. Following initial penetration and acceleration through conversion of market share from traditional chemical methods,
the growth of the protein refolding business is expected to follow the growth trajectory of the entire biopharmaceutical market.
Our BaroFold platform technology has been shown not only to save manufacturing costs and time, but to boost protein yield and minimize
protein immunogenicity, resulting in greater efficacy and safety for the patient.
Moreover, PBI’s Barocycler line of products can also be utilized in accelerated protein stability testing to guide biopharmaceutical formulation
development. PBI has initiated several collaborations, including a co-marketing agreement with RedShift BioAnalytics, Inc., and a research
collaboration with the University of Delaware (see the Research and Development section below).
c. Products
Instruments: Barocycler 2320 EXT - a convenient screening tool for protein refolding optimization
Originally developed within the framework of our PCT platform business as a tool for biological sample preparation (as described above), our
Barocycler 2320EXT instrument features a “ramp mode” in its control software that makes it ultimately suitable for performing research-scale
experiments for protein refolding and disaggregation on a laboratory bench scale. Each protein molecule is biochemically unique and, while
pressure is highly efficient in solubilization of practically any misfolded protein contained within inclusion bodies, a unique chemical environment
may be required to persuade each unfolded protein molecule to refold into a stable biologically active state. Therefore, development of protein
refolding methods requires screening experiments necessary to determine the most optimal composition of the chemical milieu for each protein of
interest. The Barocycler 2320EXT is ideally suited for such experiments, providing researchers with abilities to process up to 12 specimens per
batch in varying chemical environments. We believe that availability of this affordable screening tool will promote adoption of the high-pressure
refolding approach among biopharmaceutical process development teams and academic researchers involved in development of protein
biopharmaceuticals. The same instrument is also uniquely suited for studies of thermodynamics of protein aggregation and accelerated protein
stability tests.

BaroFold Contract Services
Our BaroFold contract services can be used to significantly impact and improve the quality of large-molecule protein biotherapeutics. These
services employ high pressure manipulations for the disaggregation and unfolding of proteins to their native structural states and then controlled
refolding of the proteins to the desired therapeutically active state, at yields and efficiencies not achievable using existing technologies. The
BaroFold Platform has been shown to eliminate protein aggregation during biotherapeutic drug manufacturing and storage, thereby improving
product yield, efficacy and safety for both new-drug entities and biosimilar products. The BaroFold platform can help companies create novel
protein therapeutics, accelerate therapeutic protein development, manufacture follow-on biologics, and enable life-cycle management of protein
therapeutics. It is scalable and practical for standard manufacturing processes. This unique technology platform can help protein-based
biopharmaceutical companies create and manufacture high quality, novel protein therapeutics and lower the cost of existing formulations.
Research and manufacturing licenses are available.

e. Competition
Over two decades, BaroFold, Inc. built an intellectual property portfolio centered around the use of hydrostatic pressure for protein refolding and
disaggregation. Following BaroFold’s acquisition by PBI in 2017, this portfolio, combined with the PBI patents in adjacent areas, puts PBI in a
unique position worldwide to commercialize, practice and license out the right to practice high pressure protein refolding, disaggregation and
accelerated stability testing. There is no direct competition to PBI that is using high pressure for these applications. Competing traditional
approaches use chemicals for refolding and appear inferior in many aspects, as described above.
f. Manufacturing and Supply
Manufacturing of the Barocycler 2320EXT has been covered above, since this instrument shares its utility with applications of PCT technology
platform. The PCT MicroTube consumable line is also shared between these two application areas.
PBI currently develops GMP-compliant, pilot-scale, high-pressure systems for processing of protein batches up to 10L in volume at pressure up to
60,000 psi.
In order to provide access for our customers to manufacturing-scale high pressure equipment, PBI is currently in negotiations with several HPP
(High Pressure Processing) equipment vendors supplying large pressure systems to food manufacturers. Upon successful feasibility studies
conducted by customers themselves, or within the framework of BaroFold Contract Services, PBI will act as a contractor to assist protein refolding
customers in scaling up the process and identifying, procuring and validating appropriate large-scale equipment for high pressure protein
refolding.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 14

g. Research and Development
The PBI team has gained access to a significant body of research data through acquisition of the assets of BaroFold, Inc. BaroFold has spent over
two decades perfecting high-pressure protein refolding applications and produced many publications and patents (see below). Our team’s
experience in high pressure refolding is being used in Contract Service work currently offered by PBI to our biopharmaceutical customers, as
described above. As an equipment vendor, PBI has a goal of taking advantage of these R&D instrument assets and turning a benchtop high
pressure protein refolding solution into a convenient, popular and easily accessible workflow for thousands of laboratories worldwide. As the
knowledge about this method spreads and feasibility of great economic impact of utilizing this approach at a production scale is demonstrated, PBI
plans to license high pressure refolding methods to its biopharmaceutical customers.
Many protein biopharmaceuticals must be kept in solution. Any physical factors such as exposure to temperature fluctuations in storage and
shipment, mechanical vibration, exposure to light, etc., could promote protein aggregation, if the biotherapeutic protein is stored in a suboptimal
chemical environment. Protein aggregates tend to be highly immunogenic, i.e., causing a patient’s immune system to recognize protein drug as a
foreign object and destroy it, leading to undesired inflammatory response and counteracting the desired therapeutic effect. Each protein drug may
require optimization of its chemical environment (formulations development) to guarantee maximal stability and shelf life.
Meanwhile, high pressure is a convenient tool for controlled protein unfolding. Partially unfolded proteins tend to aggregate more rapidly. Brief
exposure of the protein drug in a specific formulation to a “pressure shock” can be used to promote aggregation, allowing researchers to screen for
best formulations that prevent drug aggregation in a matter of only a few days.
Additionally, several new applications of high pressure in biopharmaceutical development are stemming from a combined BaroFold and PBI
intellectual property portfolio. One of these highly promising applications, namely, pressure-assisted accelerated protein stability testing, is
currently being developed by PBI’s R&D team in collaboration with the Center for Biomanufacturing Science and Technology of the University of
Delaware, headed by Professor Christopher J. Roberts. Conventional approaches for accelerated stability testing utilize exposure to high
temperature. Since thermal effects on proteins are stochastic (i.e., random), there is little chance that every protein molecule will follow the same
fate after thermal shock. Pressure exerts its effect on all protein molecules of the same type/conformation in exactly the same manner, making the
pressure shock more effective in such studies. Our collaborative research program with Professor Roberts’s team is directed towards development
of validated workflows for high pressure accelerated stability testing.
The UST Platform
a. Description
Animals and plants are water-based life forms. As such, they do not absorb oils very effectively, orally, transdermally or in any other manner. By
creating very small particles (<100nm) of oil and water, we are able to change many of the characteristics of these oils, including stability,
transparency, and absorbability. The UST™ Platform is based on the use of intense shear forces generated from ultra-high pressure (greater than
20,000 psi) discharged through a proprietary dynamically-controlled nanometer-scale valve orifice. UST has been shown to turn hydrophobic
extracts of desired oil-soluble active molecules into stable, effectively water-soluble formulations on a laboratory and small process production
scales, with a clear pathway to scale up for large scale production requirements. The UST Platform offers the potential to produce stable
nanoemulsions of oil-like products in water. Such formulations could potentially have enormous success in many markets, including
pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals (such as medically important plant oil extracts like CBD-enriched plant oil soluble in water), cosmeceuticals and
personal care products, liquid foods and beverages, agrochemicals, as well as inks, paints, lubricants and other industrial products. We believe that
UST has the potential to play a significant role in a number of commercially important areas, including (i) the creation of stable nanoemulsions of
otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water), and (ii) the preparation of higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature
stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be effectively preserved using existing non-thermal technologies, e.g., dairy products.
UST is an emerging technology that combines intense fluid shear forces with an instant, short-lived burst of heat achieved by specialized high-
pressure equipment that can produce commercially sterile, pumpable, homogeneous fluid products. The UST process can provide energetic cellular
disruption that results in the inactivation of bacteria, bacterial spores, viruses, and enzymes. Depending on operating conditions, low nano-scale
emulsions (nanoemulsions) of oil and water mixtures can be produced that have been shown to have improved room-temperature shelf stability, and
superior sensory profiles (taste, smell, texture and appearance). Of particular importance, oil-based active components delivered in such extreme
nano-emulsions in water facilitates greatly improved absorption and bioavailability in the water-based biochemistry of humans, animals and plants,
allowing for much lower loading quantities of actives required in manufacture, while ensuring safer and more controlled effective dosing.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 15

The Company received its second US patent in 2021 to complement two patents in China on UST, focused on a low cost, scalable approach for
product manufacturing. The Company believes this method can find use in various nanoemulsion applications for pharmaceutical (e.g., drug
delivery), biotechnology (e.g., protein recovery, biomolecule extraction), agrochemical, cosmetics, and food (e.g., shelf-stable “clean label”
products). We plan to design, develop, manufacture, and market UST-based production instruments, services and production to the life sciences
and other industries. We initiated the process to build full-scale UST systems initially at two sites, in order to address current customer demands
and the belief that a large number of foods, cosmetics/skincare, nutraceuticals, pharmaceutical, and other companies will follow. Our business
model for UST is focused on service contracts for product development, demonstration and optimization, followed by tolling for production at small
and intermediate scales, and finally by establishment of lease and licensing arrangements with companies desiring to control and integrate UST
production in-house.
b. Market
In 2019, we focused efforts on developing and demonstrating the UST protocol and seeding early adopters, which would provide insights into
market, formulation, product development, and ultimately end product requirements. Our initial market focus has been on cannabis extracts, as
this market’s unmet needs for nanoemulsions solutions offer high visibility and ready access to funding, versus many other important target
markets, such as cosmetics, food and beverage, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and industrial fluids and lubricants. In 2020, we refined the Ultra
Shear Technology ™ K45 instrument (the “BaroShear”) allowing us to run samples for multiple potential customers, which demonstrated the goal of
producing room-temperature-stable, nearly mono-disperse, low-droplet-size nanoemulsions, validated by excellent transparency. (Transparency is
achieved when nanoemulsion droplet sizes are well below ~150nm, i.e. smaller than the wavelength range of visible light – an important indicator
of achievement of extremely low-scale nanoemulsions.)
We also moved forward in the development of the BaroShear Mini: a bench-top, laboratory-based instrument for research, formulation, and
small volume processing; and the BaroShear Max: a high-volume, industrial-scale, clean-in-place (CIP), production-scale instrument.
In 2022, we demonstrated that our CBD nanoemulsion was stable for more than 30 months at room temperature or refrigerated conditions, and
after repeated freeze/thaw events. At the time of this publication, that product has remained stable for more the 30 months. We shipped the first
UltraShear Max system to our partners at The Ohio State University. We also initiated to process of setting up two bi-coastal facilities capable of
meeting the development and production needs for several customers. In the last month of the year, we shipped our first commercial batch and
announced important commercial relationships in both the cannabis market and cosmeceuticals. In 2023, we plan to commercialize UST in multiple
market segments.
c. Products
The Ultra Shear Technology™ platform instrument portfolio is currently comprised of three models for use in research, formulation, and
processing of oil and water nanoemulsions.
○ UltraShear Mini – bench-top instrument to be used for research, formulation, and small volume processing. Throughput of at least 1mL /
minute.
○ UltraShear K45 – pilot scale, floor standing instrument for throughput of at least 1L / hour.
○ UltraShear Max – floor standing, fully automated, CIP industrial production system for throughput of more than 4L / minute.
d. Customers
Cannabis extracts, cosmecetical & personal care products, liquid foods & beverages, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, inks,
paints, lubricants and other industrial products, and researchers and processors interested in developing stable, water-soluble nanoemulsions for
any application.
e. Competition - High Pressure
The following companies are either direct or indirect competitors of PBI:
● Avestin / ATA Scientific – Australia
● Bee International, Easton, MA – USA
● DyHydromatics, Maynard, MA - USA
● ELVEFLOW an Elvesys brand, Paris, FRANCE
● Microfluidics an IDEX Corp Company, Westwood, MA – USA
f. Manufacturing and Supply
PBI’s current commercialization strategy is to initially produce UST-processed bulk nanoemulsion products for companies in a variety of
markets. These concentrated products will either be used as a final form or infused into another product and packaged by our customers. The
development of both the machines and processed will be handled by PBI’s development and engineering team, with manufacturing at a combination
of our locations, and utilizing selected Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO), and, ultimately, with the end customers, where appropriate.
We believe the demand for these high value concentrates will generate necessary revenues and allow us to begin production and marketing of
devices for sale within two years. At that time, aftermarket service and support will initially be handled by PBI’s service and repair staff. As unit
placements grow, we will investigate expansion of PBI’s service and support organization or augment it with external partners.

The PBI Agrochem Platform
In February 2021, PBI announced a signed Letter of Intent to acquire the assets and senior management of a dormant company with an
extensive portfolio of innovative agrochemical products, utilizing natural product oils as active ingredients (similar to the use of orange oil or neem
oil for pest control). With the intense and growing focus of consumers and governments on the long term environmental and health challenges
presented by many conventional agrochemical products, this new class of “green” essential oil agrochemicals that are effective, while also
considered safe for humans and animals represent a highly attractive and high-growth segment of the agrochemicals market.
The ability of PBI to further differentiate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these products versus traditional agrochemicals, through the
application of UST to obtain all of the benefits of extremely low droplet-size nanoemulsions, offers a compelling growth and profitability
acceleration opportunity in the agrochemicals business sector. While PBI is pursuing a lease and license model for the rollout of its UST platform
into other business sectors, we elected to test a direct participation model in the agrochemical applications sector.
In July 2021, PBI established PBI Agrochem, Inc., a wholly owned agrochemicals subsidiary, in order to purchase up to $1M of “green”
agrochemical products from the targeted acquisition, to allow the management of the dormant agrochemicals company to demonstrate the
reestablishment of previous business relationships and sales channels, and to provide access to early agrochemical sales revenues for PBI (prior to
closing the asset acquisition transaction). PBI Agrochem leased a warehouse near Sparks, NV and hired a warehouse manager to facilitate the
shipping, storage and management of the “green” agrochemicals inventory. That management of the dormant agrochemicals company has not been
effective in the reestablishment of sales channels and revenues, but PBI Agrochem is continuing to focus on developing this important area of
market opportunity.
The year ended December 31, 2022 was very disappointing as sales of AgroChem did not materialize as expected. The historic prolonged
drought in California and much of the West significantly impacted the agricultural markets. With the profound shift in weather at the end of 2022,
there are some signs that the market will be more receptive in 2023.

a. Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and sales functions are led by John Hollister, our Director of Sales and Marketing. Mr. Hollister oversees and directs all
marketing and sales activities, including trade show attendance and sponsorship, on-line advertising, website maintenance and improvement,
search engine optimization, creation and dissemination of newsletters, market research initiatives, the arrangement of on-location seminars,
lectures, and demonstrations of instrumentation and consumables capabilities, and the supervision of our sales and marketing personnel. Mr.
Schumacher is also responsible for the overall coordination of our collaboration programs, from initial set-up, research plan design, and training,
service, and data analysis. Some of these responsibilities are shared with other departments such as Research and Development, but marketing and
sales drives the collaborative process. Mr. Hollister is also responsible for the continued coordination and support of our foreign distribution
partners. The Company is in the process of recruiting a field salesperson.
Our sales and marketing efforts are centered on using the independent data developed and disseminated by our collaboration partners to help
drive the installed base of our PCT Sample Preparation System, BaroFold services, and BaroShear UST platform. The development of scientific data
by our partners and our internal researchers provides our sales and marketing staff with additional tools that are essential in selling existing and
newly developed paradigm-shifting, high-value technologies and services. We believe that partnering with seasoned, capable equipment
distribution partners in the cannabis and other laboratory and process manufacturing markets will drive lead generation and purchase orders
faster than if we were to build our own sales force.

b. Marketing Strategy
We recognize that our enabling PCT, BaroFold, and UST pressure platforms are powerful, novel platform technologies. We also recognize that
the power of pressure is not yet widely understood, appreciated and utilized by researchers and engineers in today’s laboratories and prospective
industrial partners. Our first goal is to greatly broaden the awareness of pressure and its applications among research scientists and to ensure they
know that these technologies exist through our high-pressure instruments, requisite consumables, and unique services. To accomplish this
expansion of knowledge about the power of pressure and the subsequent adoption of our pressure-based technology platforms, we have developed
and are implementing a multi-faceted approach to marketing our products and services.
Key Opinion Leaders and Publications
To initially reach scientists, we have established collaborations with key opinion leaders (KOL) who recognized early the potential for our
pressure-based platforms and who went on to report their discoveries in peer reviewed journals. Among the KOLs working with us is Dr. Ruedi
Aebersold (Head of the Department of Biology, ETH, Zurich). Dr. Aebersold, a pioneer in proteomics, worked with our scientists and engineers to
develop PCT-SWATH (aka PCT-HD), a superior method for the extraction and preparation of proteins from samples intended for analysis by mass
spectrometry. Other KOLs include Dr. Jennifer van Eyk (Director of Advanced Clinical Biosystems Institute in the Department of Biomedical
Sciences, Cedar Sinai, Los Angeles, CA) and Dr. Wayne Hubble (Jules Stein Professor at the University of California, LA). Dr. van Eyk is a
recognized expert in the causes of heart disease and is using PCT in her attempt to discover cardiac disease biomarkers. Dr. Hubble, a member of
the National Academy of Sciences, is a leader in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). He uses PCT in his studies of protein-protein
interactions, which are highly important in the discovery of drug targets and drug design. The publications and presentations of these and other
world class scientists have been invaluable in gaining initial entry of PCT in several areas of research. In addition to publications by our numerous
KOLs, there are also many additional peer reviewed publications from dozens of other scientists discussing the advantages of the PCT platform in
bio-molecule sample preparation, as well as the advantages of our BaroFold technology and our UST platform. To this end, we do all we can to
disseminate the work of these scientists in an effort to increase the exposure of PCT, BaroFold, and UST to the worldwide research community.
Broadcasting Our PCT, BaroFold and UST Platform Technologies and Products
1. We attend, exhibit, and present at top scientific meetings such as the American Society of Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) and both the US and
International meetings of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO). These meetings are an opportunity to present our technology and to
showcase our products to scientists who require sample preparation in their research studies.
2. Routine and timely “blast” emails to scientists in our database. Topics include new PCT-related publications, announcements of meetings,
product advertisements, and a quarterly newsletter. The database we use is proprietary, as it has been built from attending scientific
meetings and searching the internet for relevant publications and contact information. Pardot Marketing automation software is utilized for
routing email campaigns, allowing us to measure customer engagement with our landing pages, articles and emails.
3. We manage our database with SalesForce, a state-of-the-art Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Through SalesForce, we
employ the marketing automation software Pardot to manage our email blasts. Pardot enables us to assess open rates, levels of interest, and
to create automatic and constant contact with potential clients.
4. We use social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook to broadcast publications, webinars, our presence at scientific meetings,
and press releases. We employ LeadForensics and SRAX to amplify our targeting and social media efforts. Social media enables us to easily
reach scientists world-wide.
5. We significantly upgraded our website. The upgraded website contains a state-of-the art search engine that enables researchers to rapidly
find PCT-related publications and products.
6. The website contains product information, published articles, and videos of our products to foster engagement, product interest, leads,
order placement, and learning.
7. Our scientists regularly present their findings and discuss our products at scientific sessions at regional, national, and international
scientific conferences, and at corporate, government, and academic laboratories.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 18

8. In addition to electronic advertising, we have used and will continue to use print media to showcase our products.
In 2023, we plan to expand our Sales and Marketing team, in order to support these efforts.
c. Foreign Distribution Network
We have previously established distribution arrangements covering China, Poland, South Korea, Japan, and 24 countries in Western Europe.
On December 3, 2021, we entered into a two-year distribution agreement with Westlake Omics Biotechnology, Ltd, in Hangzhou, China with the
belief that they were capable of rapidly expanding the market for Barocyclers in China.
In February 2016, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with Bioanalytic of Poland, pursuant to which PBI granted Bioanalytic
exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in Poland... In August of 2021, we expanded our relationship with Bioanalytic to reflect an
exclusive distribution relationship for all of the EU and non-EU members in Western Europe, in addition to Poland. In August 2021, we signed an
exclusive distribution agreement with Bioanalytic on Aug 1 2021 that expires on December 31, 2023.
In September of 2016, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with Vita Co. of Japan, pursuant to which we granted Vita Co.
exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in Japan. This agreement expired in 2019. We continue to maintain a distribution
relationship with Vita and are in contract renewal discussions.
In January 2020, we entered into a three-year distribution agreement with SCINCO Co., LTD of South Korea, pursuant to which PBI granted
SCINCO exclusive distribution rights to all of our PCT products in South Korea. The Companies are in discussion for an extension of this
agreement.
Non-Exclusive and Other Distribution Agreements
In November 2011, we entered into a distributor agreement with OROBOROS Instruments Corp. (“OROBOROS”) of Austria, pursuant to which
we granted OROBOROS non-exclusive world-wide distribution rights to our Shredder SG3 System and related products.
We are also the exclusive distributor, throughout the Americas, for Constant Systems, Ltd.’s (“CS”) cell disruption equipment, parts, and
consumables. CS, a British company located northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical equipment, related consumable
products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures high pressure cell disruption equipment used by
life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for the extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and
controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior, constant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units
installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The CS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such
as protein from yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, and other sample types.
The CS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and our PCT-based instrumentation complement each other in several important ways. While
both the CS and our technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that the other does not offer.
Our PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects. CS’s technology uses different,
proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number of routine laboratory applications, such as protein
extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein extraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we
believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and PBI products, either separately or together.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 19

In June 2013, CS and PBI signed an expanded distribution agreement that made us the exclusive distributor of CS products throughout all of the
Americas until the end of 2019. In October 2021, we renewed this distribution agreement for an additional two years.
d. Intellectual Property
We believe that protection of our intellectual property, through patents, trademarks and other trade secrets are essential to our business.
Subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources, our practice is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and
improvements to inventions that are important to our business development. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological
innovations to develop and maintain our potential competitive position.
The Company believes the UST method can find use in various nanoemulsion applications for effective delivery of desired oil-soluble
components in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, agrochemical, industrial and food/beverage (including shelf-stable “clean label”)
products. We plan to design, develop, manufacture, and market three different models of BaroShear UST instruments:
● a bench-top, research/formulation, low-throughput instrument that we will license for formulation development;
● a lab-or pilot scale production instrument that we will license into life science companies and other industries, and
● a production scale UST-based instrument for manufacturing applications that we will license to large-scale food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals,
and other processors worldwide.
Our issued patents expire between 2022 and 2030. Any failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection may adversely affect our
ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing, sale or licensing of any of our products or technology platforms. It
may also allow our competitors to duplicate our products without our permission and without compensation.

License Agreements Relating to Pressure Cycling Technology
BioMolecular Assays, Inc.
In 1996, we acquired our initial equity interest in BioSeq, Inc., which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology.
BioSeq, Inc. acquired its pressure cycling technology from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under a technology transfer and patent assignment
agreement. In 1998, we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of BioSeq, Inc., and at such time, the technology transfer and
patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc., a 5% royalty on our sales of products or services that
incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that BioSeq, Inc. acquired from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. We were also required to
pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc. 5% of the proceeds from any sale, transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology.
These payment obligations terminated March 7, 2016.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 20

In connection with our acquisition of BioSeq, Inc., we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to
BioMolecular Assays, Inc. This license is non-exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by BioMolecular Assays, Inc.
solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development. BioMolecular Assays, Inc.
is required to pay us a royalty equal to 20% of any license or other fees and royalties, but not including research support and similar payments, it
receives in connection with any sale, assignment, license or other transfer of any rights granted to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under the license.
BioMolecular Assays, Inc. was required to pay us these royalties until the expiration in March 2016 of the patents held by BioSeq, Inc. since 1998.
We have not received any royalty payments from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under this license.
Battelle Memorial Institute
In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”). The licensed
technology is the subject of a patent application filed by Battelle in 2008 and relates to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein
samples, including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter
period than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. In addition to royalty payments on
net sales of “licensed products,” we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent
license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the
patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013, the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 in 2014
and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties were $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in 2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar year thereafter during the
term of the agreement.

f. Liquidity
Management has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes controlling expenses, streamlining operations, and obtaining
capital through equity and/or debt financing. We have been successful in raising cash through debt and equity offerings in the past. We have efforts
in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings.
Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure our investors that our plans to
address these matters in the future will be successful. Additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to
us, if at all. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to:
● severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities, which could harm
our business. The accompanying financial statements do not include adjustments that may be required in the event of the disposal of assets
or the discontinuation of the business;
● obtain financing with terms that may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital
stock; or
● obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all our
technologies or products.
g. Regulation
Many of our activities are subject to regulation by governmental authorities within the United States and similar bodies outside of the United
States. The regulatory authorities may govern the collection, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping,
transportation, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products, as well as the training of our employees.
Currently, our PCT commercialization efforts are focused in the area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation.
We do not believe that our current Barocycler products used in sample preparation are considered “medical devices” under the United States Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDA Act”) and we do not believe that we are subject to the law’s general control provisions that include requirements
for registration, listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. We also do not believe that
we are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny. If, however, we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current
focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and
immunodiagnostics, our products may be considered “medical devices” under the FDA Act, at which point we would be subject to the law’s general
control provisions and regulation by the FDA that include requirements for registration listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling, and
prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. The process of obtaining approval to market these devices in the other potential applications of
PCT would be costly and time consuming and could possibly prohibit us from pursuing such markets.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 22

Some of our devices may also become subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet
certain quality and safety standards. We do not believe that we are currently subject to this directive because our Barocycler instruments are below
the threshold documented in the text of the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the
challenge, and we could face production and selling delays, all of which could harm our business.
We self-certified that our Barocycler instrumentation was electromagnetically compatible, or “CE” compliant, which means that our Barocycler
instruments meet the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. In order to maintain
our CE Marking, a requirement to sell equipment in many countries of the European Union, we are obligated to uphold certain safety and quality
standards.
h. Employees
On December 31, 2022, we had 15 full-time employees 2 part-time employees and 1 intern. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements
intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented
by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of
competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. Subject to our limited financial resources, we attempt to maintain employee benefit
plans to enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with us.
i. Corporate Information
We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in August 1978 as Boston Biomedica, Inc. In 1996, Boston Biomedica completed
a successful initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ market (where we maintained a listing until 2012). In September 2004, we
completed the sale of Boston Biomedica’s core business units and began to focus exclusively on the development and commercialization of the PCT
platform. Following this change in business strategy, we changed our legal name from Boston Biomedica, Inc. to Pressure BioSciences, Inc. We
began operations as PBI in February 2005, research and development activities in April 2006, early marketing and selling activities of our
Barocycler instruments in late 2007, and active marketing and selling of our PCT-based instrument platform in 2012. PBI maintained its listing on
NASDAQ until 2012, at which time it was down-listed to the OTCQB market. PBI continues to focus on its objective of up-listing to a major
exchange such as the NASDAQ or NYSE markets as soon as reasonably possible.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives,
expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applicable to all forward-
looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY
We have received an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm expressing substantial doubt regarding our
ability to continue as a going concern.
The audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report states
that our auditing firm determined that there was substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not
have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December 31, 2022 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve-month period; and
if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes continued control of expenses and obtaining equity or debt
financing. Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to
address these matters in the future will be successful.
The factors described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and may cause
investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects and may adversely affect our relationships with customers. There can be no assurance
that our auditing firm will not issue the same opinion in the future. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may
lose their entire investment.
Our revenue is dependent upon acceptance of our products by the market. The failure of such acceptance will cause us to curtail
or cease operations.
Our revenue comes from the sale of our products. As a result, we will continue to incur operating losses until such time as sales of our products
reach a mature level and we are able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products to meet our operating expenses. There can be no
assurance that customers will adopt our technology and products, or that businesses and prospective customers will agree to pay for our products.
In the event that we are not able to significantly increase the number of customers that purchase our products, or if we are unable to charge the
necessary prices, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.
Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting.
We concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not
effective. We have determined that we have limited resources for adequate personnel to prepare and file reports under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 within the required time periods and that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting exist relating to our
accounting for complex equity transactions. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and remediate
the material weaknesses in a timely manner, or if we identify other material weaknesses in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely
financial statements and public reports could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We identified a lack of
sufficient segregation of duties. Specifically, this material weakness is such that the design over these areas relies primarily on detective controls
and could be strengthened by adding preventive controls to properly safeguard assets. In addition, investors may lose confidence in our reported
information and the market price of our common stock may decline.
We have a history of operating losses, anticipate future losses and may never be profitable.
We have experienced significant operating losses in each period since we began investing resources in PCT and CP. These losses have resulted
principally from research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses associated with the development of our
PCT business and more recently our BaroFold and UST business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net loss available to
common shareholders of $17,803,953 or ($1.61) per share, as compared with $22,685,459 or ($3.42) per share, for the corresponding period in
2021. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until sales increase substantially. We cannot be certain when, if ever, we will become
profitable. Even if we were to become profitable, we might not be able to sustain such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 24

If we are unable to obtain additional financing, business operations will be harmed and if we do obtain additional financing then
existing shareholders may suffer substantial dilution.
We need substantial capital to implement our sales distribution strategy for our current products and to develop and commercialize future
products using our high-pressure technology products and services across all of our targeted markets. Our capital requirements will depend on
many factors, including but not limited to:
● the problems, delays, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by early-stage companies;
● market acceptance of our high-pressure technology products and services;
● the success of our sales and marketing programs; and
● changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions in the markets we intend to serve.
We expect the net proceeds from our financing plans, along with our current cash position, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months, during which time we expect to achieve profitability. If we do not achieve
profitability as planned, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and to otherwise implement our overall
business strategy. We currently do not have any contracts or commitments for additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing will
be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to then existing
shareholders.
If adequate funds are not available or if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing, we may be required to:
● severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities, which could harm
our business;
● obtain financing, including but not limited to via the issuance of convertible notes, with terms that may have the effect of substantially
diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital stock; or
● obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all of our
technologies or products.
We have incurred substantial debt, which could impair our flexibility and access to capital and adversely affect our financial position,
and our business would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.
As described in Note 9 to our audited financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, there were $17.8 million in convertible notes outstanding
some of which is past due. One lender holds approximately $9.4 million of this debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 we were making daily
payments of $11,670. As of March 31, 2023 we were making weekly payments totaling $60,157 to service Merchant Agreements.
We may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to implement our sales distribution strategy for our current products and to develop
and commercialize future products using our high-pressure technology products and services across all of our targeted markets.
Our substantial indebtedness may:
● require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and / or to issue substantial amounts of shares of common stock
(which may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders) to service our debt;
● increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and place us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged; or
● limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and limit our ability to pursue other business
opportunities, borrow more money for operations or capital in the future, and implement our business strategies.
In addition, our cash balance is significantly less than the principal amount of our outstanding debt, and we may not generate sufficient cash
flow from our operations to pay our substantial debt. Any debt financing that is available could cause us to incur substantial costs and subject us to
covenants that significantly restrict our ability to conduct our business.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 25

Our financial results depend on revenues from our high-pressure technology products and services, and from government grants.
We currently rely on revenues from PCT, CP, BaroFold and UST technology products and services, and from revenues derived from grants
awarded to us by governmental agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. Through 2021, we have not yet achieved product readiness for
BaroFold and UST, and/or market acceptance of our product offerings, to the extent necessary to achieve revenue growth sufficient to establish
profitability. Competition for government grants is very intense, and we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be awarded grants in the
future. If we are unable to increase revenues from sales of our high-pressure technology products and services and government grants, our
business will fail.
We may be unable to obtain market acceptance of our high-pressure technology products and services.
Many of the initial sales of our pressure cycling technology products and services have been to our collaborators, following their use of our
products in studies undertaken in sample preparation for genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and small molecules studies. Later sales have been to
key opinion leaders. Our technology requires scientists and researchers to adopt a method of sample extraction that is different from existing
techniques. Our PCT sample preparation system is also more costly than most existing techniques. Our ability to obtain market acceptance will
depend, in part, on our ability to demonstrate to our potential customers that the benefits and advantages of our technology outweigh the increased
cost of our technology compared with existing methods of sample extraction. Similar early technology introduction, trial and acceptance challenges
must be surmounted for the BaroFold and UST products and services, as well. If we are unable to demonstrate the benefits and advantages of our
products and technology as compared with existing technologies, we will not gain market acceptance and our business will fail.
Our business may be harmed if we encounter problems, delays, expenses, and complications that often affect companies that have
not achieved significant market acceptance.
Our high-pressure technology businesses will continue to face challenges in achieving market acceptance. If we encounter problems, delays,
expenses and complications, many of which may be beyond our control or may harm our business or prospects. These include:
● availability of adequate financing;
● unanticipated problems and costs relating to the development, testing, production, marketing, and sale of our products;
● delays and costs associated with our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and
● competition.
The sales cycle of our high-pressure technology products is lengthy. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant
expenses and we may not generate any significant revenue related to those products.
Many of our current and potential customers have required between three and six months or more to test and evaluate our high-pressure
technology products. This increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel its order or otherwise change its plans, which could reduce
or eliminate our sales to that potential customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant
research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense related to customers from whom we have not yet
generated any revenue from our products, and from whom we may never generate the anticipated revenue if a customer is not satisfied with the
results of the evaluation of our products or if a customer cancels or changes its plans.
Our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects.
We are continuously developing new and improving our existing, high-pressure technology products and we expect to do so across many areas
of life sciences applications depending upon the availability of our resources. Newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects.
In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and
testing by our collaborators, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to
enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at
considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity or legal claims
and could harm our business and prospects.
Our success may depend on our ability to manage growth effectively.
Our failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business and prospects. Given our limited resources and personnel, growth of our
business could place significant strain on our management, information technology systems, sources of manufacturing capacity and other
resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees and identify new sources of manufacturing capabilities.
Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product
quality or increased costs, any of which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Our success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management.
Our success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management, specifically our Chief Executive Officer, Richard T.
Schumacher. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve
our business goals. In addition, our failure to retain existing engineering, research and development, operations, and marketing/sales personnel
could harm our product development capabilities and customer and employee relationships, delay the growth of sales of our products, and result in
the loss of key information, expertise, or know-how.
We may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, required for
our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.
Competition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing, finance and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to
retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, either because of competition in our industry for such personnel or
because of insufficient financial resources, our growth may be limited. Our success also depends in particular on our ability to identify, hire, train
and retain qualified engineering and sales personnel with experience in design, development and sales of laboratory equipment.
Our reliance on a single third party for all of our manufacturing, and certain of our engineering, and other related services could
harm our business.
We currently solely rely on CBM Industries, a third-party contract manufacturer, to manufacture our Barocycler 2320EXT instrumentation,
provide manufacturing expertise, and manage the majority of our sub-contractor supplier relationships for this instrument. Because of our
dependence on one manufacturer, our success will depend, in part, on the ability of CBM to manufacture our products cost effectively, in sufficient
quantities to meet our customer demand, if and when such demand occurs, and meeting our quality requirements. If CBM experiences
manufacturing problems or delays, or if CBM decides not to continue to provide us with these services, our business may be harmed. While we
believe other contract manufacturers are available to address our manufacturing and engineering needs, if we find it necessary to replace CBM,
there will be a disruption in our business and we would incur additional costs and delays that would harm our business.
Our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business.
We have entered business relationships with four distribution partners and one co-marketing partner, and we may enter into additional
alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships to further develop, market and sell our pressure cycling technology product line. We may
not be able to:
● identify appropriate candidates for alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships;
● assure that any candidate for an alliance, joint venture or business relationship will provide us with the support anticipated;
● successfully negotiate an alliance, joint venture or business relationship on terms that are advantageous to us; or
● successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.
Furthermore, any alliance, joint venture or other business relationship may divert management time and resources. Entering into a
disadvantageous alliance, joint venture or business relationship, failing to manage an alliance, joint venture or business relationship effectively, or
failing to comply with any obligations in connection therewith, could harm our business and prospects.

We may not be successful in growing our international sales.
We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop our international sales channels to enable us to generate significant revenue from
international sales. We currently have four international distribution agreements that cover 24 countries in Europe, Asia and Australia. We have
generated limited sales to date from international sales and cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our sales. As we expand, our
international operations may be subject to numerous risks and challenges, including:
● multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including those that regulate high pressure equipment;
● reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
● protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;
● political and economic changes and disruptions;
● export and import controls;
● tariff regulations; and
● currency fluctuations.
Our operating results are subject to quarterly variation. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period
depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following:
● our ability to increase our sales of our pressure cycling technology products for sample preparation on a consistent quarterly or annual
basis;
● the lengthy sales cycle for our products;
● the product mix of the Barocycler instruments we install in a given period, and whether the installations are completed pursuant to sales,
rental or lease arrangements, and the average selling prices that we are able to command for our products;
● our ability to manage our costs and expenses;
● our ability to continue our research and development activities without incurring unexpected costs and expenses; and
● our ability to comply with state and federal regulations without incurring unexpected costs and expenses.
Our instrumentation operates at high pressures and may therefore become subject to certain regulations in the European
Community. Regulation of high-pressure equipment may limit or hinder our development and sale of future instrumentation.
Our Barocycler instruments operate at high pressures. If our Barocycler instruments exceed certain pressure levels, our products may become
subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet certain quality and safety standards. We
do not believe that we are subject to this directive because our Barocycler instruments are currently below the threshold documented in the text of
the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the challenge, and we could face production
and selling delays, all of which could harm our business.
We expect that we will be subject to regulation in the United States, such as by the Food and Drug Administration, and overseas, if
and when we begin to invest more resources in the development and commercialization of PCT in applications outside of sample
preparation for the research field.
Our current pressure cycling technology products in sample preparation for the research field are not regulated by the FDA. Certain
applications in which we intend to develop and commercialize pressure cycling technology, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and
immunodiagnostics, are expected to require regulatory approvals or clearances from regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, prior to
commercialization, when we expand our commercialization activities outside of the research field. We expect that obtaining these approvals or
clearances will require a significant investment of time and capital resources and there can be no assurance that such investments will receive
approvals or clearances that would allow us to commercialize the technology for these applications.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 28

If we are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary technology relating to our pressure cycling technology products, our
business will be harmed.
Our ability to further develop and successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part, on our ability to enforce our patents, preserve
our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To date, we have been awarded 26 total United States and
foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and one US patent and two additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear
Technology. We also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in December 2017.
There can be no assurance that (a) any patent applications filed by us will result in issued patents; (b) patent protection will be secured for any
particular technology; (c) any patents that have been or may be issued to us will be valid or enforceable; (d) any patents will provide meaningful
protection to us; (e) others will not be able to design around our patents; and (f) our patents will provide a competitive advantage or have
commercial value. The failure to obtain adequate patent protection would have a material adverse effect on us and may adversely affect our ability
to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing or sale of any product.
Our patents may be challenged by others.
We could incur substantial costs in patent proceedings, including interference proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, and comparable proceedings before similar agencies in other countries, in connection with any claims that may arise in the future. These
proceedings could result in adverse decisions about the patentability of our inventions and products, as well as about the enforceability, validity, or
scope of protection afforded by the patents.
If we are unable to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, others may develop technology
and products that could prevent the successful commercialization of our products.
We rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in our product development activities. To the extent we rely on trade
secrets and unpatented know-how to maintain our competitive technological position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently
develop the same or similar technologies. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, in part, through confidentiality
agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors. These agreements may not be sufficient to effectively prevent disclosure of
our confidential information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If our
employees, consultants, advisors, or contractors develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our products, disputes
may arise about ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our
property but may remain the property of those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and
determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, for any reason, could harm our business.
If we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business may be harmed.
It is possible that the manufacture, use or sale of our pressure cycling technology products or services may infringe patent or other intellectual
property rights of others. We may be unable to avoid infringement of the patent or other intellectual property rights of others and may be required
to seek a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents or other intellectual property rights in court. We may be
unable to secure a license on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all. Also, we may not prevail in any patent or other intellectual property
rights litigation. Patent or other intellectual property rights litigation is costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will have
sufficient resources to bring any possible litigation related to such infringement to a successful conclusion. If we do not obtain a license under such
patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we are found liable for infringement, or if we are unsuccessful in having such patents declared
invalid, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in successfully commercializing and developing our
pressure cycling technology products, or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use, or sale of our pressure cycling technology
products or services requiring such licenses.
We may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology and the development of new industry standards.
The introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing
pressure cycling technology products and related services obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. We may be unable to
allocate the funds necessary to improve our current products or introduce new products to address our customers’ needs and respond to
technological change. In the event that other companies develop more technologically advanced products, our competitive position relative to such
companies would be harmed.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 29

We may not be able to compete successfully with others that are developing or have developed competitive technologies and
products.
Several companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. We compete with
companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules from cells and tissues, including but not
limited to methods such as mortar and pestle, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French press, bead beating, freezer milling, enzymatic
digestion, and chemical dissolution.
We are aware that there are additional companies pursuing new technologies with similar goals to the products developed or being developed
by us. Some of the companies with which we now compete, or may compete in the future, have or may have more extensive research, marketing,
and manufacturing capabilities, more experience in genomics and proteomics sample preparation, protein purification, pathogen inactivation,
immunodiagnostics, and DNA sequencing and significantly greater technical, personnel and financial resources than we do, and may be better
positioned to continue to improve their technology to compete in an evolving industry. To compete, we must be able to demonstrate to potential
customers that our products provide improved performance and capabilities. Our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and
prospects.
We will need to increase the size of our organization and may experience difficulties in managing growth.
We are a small company with a minimal number of employees. We expect to experience a period of expansion in headcount, facilities,
infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth and market opportunities. Future
growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate
new managers. Our future financial performance and its ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to manage any future
growth effectively.
Provisions in our articles of organization and bylaws may discourage or frustrate stockholders’ attempts to remove or replace our
current management.
Our articles of organization and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult or discourage changes in our management that our
stockholders may consider to be favorable. These provisions include:
● a classified board of directors;
● advance notice for stockholder nominations to the board of directors;
● limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors; and
● a provision that allows most of the directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors.
These provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts to make changes in our management that our stockholders consider to be beneficial and
could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.
The costs of compliance with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, and with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may place a strain on our limited resources and our
management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.
As a result of the regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, we incur legal, accounting, and other expenses that are significant in
relation to the size of our Company including expenses related to complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and OTC Markets Group, Inc. These requirements
have placed and will continue to place a strain on our systems and on our management and financial resources.
Certain of our net deferred tax assets could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code.
Certain of our net operating losses (“NOLs”) give rise to net deferred tax assets. Our ability to utilize NOLs and to offset our future taxable
income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by
“5 percent shareholders,” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage
of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5 percent shareholders” at any time over the preceding three years.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 30

An ownership change under Section 382 of the Code would establish an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our
taxable income in any single taxable year to an amount equal to (i) the product of a specified rate, which is published by the U.S. Treasury, and the
aggregate value of our outstanding stock plus; and (ii) the amount of unutilized limitation from prior years. The application of these limitations
might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs. We may have or will have experienced an ownership change as
defined by Section 382 through the sale of equity and, therefore, we will consider whether the sale of equity units will result in limitations of our
net operating losses under Section 382 when we start to generate taxable income. However, whether a change in ownership occurs in the future is
largely outside of our control, and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur.
We continue to face risks related to Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) which could continue to significantly disrupt our research and
development, operations, sales, and financial results.
Our business was adversely impacted by the effects of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments could continue to cause disruption to our
operations, research and development, and sales activities. Our third-party manufacturers, third-party distributors, and our customers have been
and will be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on employees’ ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to
ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects
on our activities or the operations of our third-party manufacturers and third-party distributors, the supply of our products will be delayed, which
could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships. In addition, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) or other disease
outbreak will in the short-run and may over the longer term adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an
economic downturn that will affect demand for our products and impact our operating results. There can be no assurance that any decrease in
sales resulting from the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods. Although the magnitude of the
impact of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued spread of the Novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) or the occurrence of other epidemics and the imposition of related public health measures and travel and business
restrictions will adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we have experienced and will
experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other movement and restrictions on the ability of
our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to develop and design our products in a timely manner or meet required milestones
or customer commitments.
RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES
The holders of our Common Stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices.
The holders of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices, which, in the past few years, have
included private placements and a registered direct offering. As of December 31, 2022, there were 13,682,910 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding. As of December 31, 2022 there were 300 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and convertible into
25,000 shares of common stock, 80,570 shares of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 26,857 shares of
common stock, 10,000 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 33,334 shares of common stock, 21
shares of Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 70,000 shares of common stock, 3,458 shares of Series J
Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 115,267 shares of common stock, 6,880 shares of Series K Convertible
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 229,334 shares of common stock and 8,645 shares of Series AA Convertible Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 8,645,000 shares of common stock.
Further, in connection with private placement offerings and the Series D registered direct offering, we issued warrants to purchase common
stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had issued notes and debentures convertible into common stock at $2.50 per common share and
outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 17,540,209 shares of common stock; and debt convertible into 5,232,118 shares of
common stock.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 31

If all of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series J Convertible Preferred Stock, Series K Convertible Preferred Stock and Series AA Convertible
Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock and all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
exercised and all convertible notes and debentures were converted, each as of December 31, 2021, an additional 31,921,119 shares of common
stock would be issued and outstanding, summing to a total dilution of 41,041,645 common shares.. This additional issuance of shares of common
stock would cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our
common stock.
From time to time, we also may increase the number of shares available for issuance in connection with our equity compensation plan, we may
adopt new equity compensation plans, and we may issue awards to our employees and others who provide services to us outside the terms of our
equity compensation plans. Our board of directors may fix and determine the designations, rights, preferences or other variations of each class or
series of preferred stock and may choose to issue some or all of such shares to provide additional financing in the future.
The issuance of any securities for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon conversion of any preferred stock or exercise of warrants,
pursuant to our equity compensation plans, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of
our common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power
of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change in control of our Company.
Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception of such possible sales, could
depress the market price of our common stock.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, which include an offering of our preferred stock or common
stock could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-
related securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market
price of our common stock.
Our share price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.
The price of common stock has been and may in the future continue to be extremely volatile. Many factors could have a significant impact on
the future price of our shares of common stock, including:
● our inability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, whether through the issuance of equity securities or debt;
● our failure to successfully implement our business objectives;
● compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;
● market acceptance of our products;
● technological innovations and new commercial products by our competitors;
● changes in government regulations;
● general economic conditions and other external factors;
● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; and
● the degree of trading liquidity in our shares of common stock.
A decline in the price of our shares of common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact
our ability to continue operations.
The relatively low price of our shares of common stock, and a decline in the price of our shares of common stock, could result in a reduction in
the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations has been and will
continue to be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our shares of common stock could be especially detrimental to
our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions and declines may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant
negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to continue our current operations. If the price for our shares of common
stock declines, it may be more difficult to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, and we are unable to generate funds
from operations sufficient to meet our obligations, we will not have the resources to continue our operations.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 32

The market price for our shares of common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors.
Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and
sell our common stock.
FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for
believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment
objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their
customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our
shares.
Our Common Stock is subject to the “Penny Stock” rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which
makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant
to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
● That a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks; and
● The broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny
stock to be purchased.
In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:
● Obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and
● Make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge
and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
● Sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and
● That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult
for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the
commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies
available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price
information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future.

Our shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to certain rights, privileges and preferences over our common
stock, including a preference upon a liquidation of our Company, which will reduce amounts available for distribution to the holders
of our common stock.
The holders of our shares of Series D are entitled to payment, prior to payment to the holders of common stock in the event of liquidation of the
Company. If we are dissolved, liquidated or wound up at a time when the Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series D
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive only an amount equal to the liquidation preference (as it may be adjusted from time to time), plus any
accumulated and unpaid dividends, to the extent that we have funds legally available. Any remaining assets will be distributable to holders of our
other equity securities.
Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.
From time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary
brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general,
pursuant to amended Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information
requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information
and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price
of our common stock.
We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. As result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your
investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.
We currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, in the future we may enter into agreements that
prohibit or restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. As a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your
investment will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit.
We could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our Common Stock.
Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares.
Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock. In
addition, in order to raise capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. These issuances
would dilute the percentage ownership interest, which would have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our shareholders vote
and might dilute the book value of our common stock. Shareholders may incur additional dilution if holders of stock warrants or options, whether
currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our
common stock.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our corporate office is currently located at 14 Norfolk Avenue, South Easton, Massachusetts 02375. We are currently paying $7,650 per month,
on a lease extension, signed on December 31, 2022, that expires December 31, 2023, for our corporate office. We expanded our space to include
offices, warehouse, and a loading dock on the first floor starting May 1, 2017, with a monthly rent increase already reflected in the current
payments.
On October 18, 2017, we signed a lease extension for our lab space in Medford, MA. The lease will now expire on December 30, 2023, and
required monthly payments of $7,282 that started January 1, 2021, and $8,237 started January 1, 2023, subject to annual cost of living increases.
The lease shall be automatically extended for additional three years unless either party terminates at least six months prior to the expiration of the
current lease term.
On August 9, 2021, we entered into an operating lease agreement for our warehouse space in Sparks, NV for the period from September 1,

Not Applicable.
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.
OVERVIEW
We are a leader in the development & sale of innovative, broadly enabling, pressure-based platform solutions for the worldwide life sciences
industry. Our solutions are based on the unique properties of both constant (i.e., static) and alternating (i.e., pressure cycling technology, or “PCT”)
hydrostatic pressure. PCT is a patented enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and
ultra-high levels to safely and reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., cell lysis, biomolecule extraction). Historically, our primary
focus has been in the development of PCT-based products for biomarker and target discovery, drug design and development, biotherapeutics
characterization and quality control, soil & plant biology, forensics, and counter-bioterror applications. In more recent years, major new market
opportunities have emerged in the use of our pressure-based technologies in the following areas: (1) the use of our recently acquired, patented
technology from BaroFold, Inc. (the “BaroFold” technology platform) to allow entry into the bio-pharma contract services sector, and (2) the use of
our recently-patented, scalable, high-efficiency, pressure-based Ultra Shear Technology (“UST”) platform to (i) create stable nanoemulsions of
otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and water) and to (ii) prepare higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable
low-acid liquid foods that cannot be effectively preserved using existing non-thermal technologies.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 36

On February 8, 2021, PBI announced plans to acquire the assets of a global eco-friendly agrochemical supplier. This opportunity is attractive as
it has the potential of readily producing significant revenue, as well as the potential to apply the UST technology to improve some of the product
line. In July 2021, a newly-formed subsidiary of PBI, PBI Agrochem, leased a warehouse in Sparks, NV, and hired a warehouse manager. See the
further description of this possible transaction in Item 1 – Business – “The PBI Agrochem Platform.”
Patents
To date, we have been awarded 26 total United States and foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and one US patent and two
additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear Technology. We also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in
December 2017. PBI also has 19 pending patents in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, China, and Taiwan.
Primary Fields of Use and Application for PCT
Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as
one of the key parts of sample preparation. The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies
includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting biomolecules such as nucleic acid i.e., DNA
and/or RNA, proteins, lipids, or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. Our current commercialization
efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution for sample extraction when compared to other
available technologies or procedures and thus might significantly improve the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result.
Within the broad field of biological sample preparation, in particular sample extraction, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant pressure
(“CP”) product development efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery (primarily through mass spectrometric analysis), forensics, and
histology. We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in
the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and quality extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small
molecules from a wide variety of plant, animal, and microbiological cells and tissues.
Biomarker Discovery and Precision Medicine
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for long-term storage and subsequent pathology
evaluation is to process them into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) samples. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is
highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule
recovery, and safety.
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and
other life science institutions in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/Pacific. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration in
these target areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler instrumentation to additional
laboratories within current customer organizations.
If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule
sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include
hospitals, reference laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and other sites involved in each specific application. If we are successful in
forensics, our potential customers could be forensic laboratories, military and other government agencies. If we are successful in biomarker
discovery and precision medicine - specifically the extraction of biomolecules from FFPE tissues, our potential customers could be pharmaceutical
companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or differentiation of disease states, subtypes and susceptibility to alternative
treatments.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 37

Forensics
The detection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide in their
efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas and Florida International
University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples (e.g., bone and hair) when using the PCT platform in the sample
preparation process. We believe that PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA from sperm cells and female epithelial cells captured in
swabs collected from rape victims and subsequently stored in rape kits. We also believe that there are many completed rape kits that remain
untested for reasons such as cost, time and quality of results. We further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from sperm and not
epithelial cells could reduce the cost of such testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process.
Going Concern
The audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022, contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report states
that our auditing firm determined that there was substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not
have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December 31, 2022 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve-month period; and
if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Management has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes continued control of expenses and obtaining equity or debt
financing. Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to
address these matters in the future will be successful.
The factors described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and may cause
investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects and may adversely affect our relationships with customers. There can be no assurance
that our auditing firm will not issue the same opinion in the future. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may
lose their entire investment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2022 as compared with December 31, 2021
Products and Services Revenue
Revenue from the sale of products and services was $1,729,343 in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with $2,002,365 in the year ended
December 31, 2021, a 13.6 % decrease. Revenue included sales of both PBI and Constant System pressure-based products, sales of BaroFold and
UST Contract Services and sales of PBI Agrochem products. Sales of instrumentation decreased in 2022 by $323,247 or 31%, from $1,046,845 in
2021 to $723,598 in 2022. Sales of consumables were $257,325 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $274,108 for the same period
in 2021, a decrease of $16,783 or 6%. Sales of BaroFold and UST Contract Services decreased by 27% from $268,157 in 2021 to $196,000 in 2022.
Products, Services, and Other Revenue included $79,901 from non-cash transactions in the current year while the prior year included non-cash
transactions of $11,046. Revenue from non-cash transactions was recognized based on the carrying value of the assets involved per ASC 845.
Cost of Products and Services
The cost of products and services was $2,014,004 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $942,383 in 2021. Our cost of products
and services increased $1,071,621 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
mostly attributed to an increase of our inventory reserve of $641,815 along with the full year expense of the warehouse space in Sparks NV to
house the Agrochem products and the staff and associated expenses for its management.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 38

Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $969,532 for 2022 compared to $1,101,509 in 2021, a decrease of $131,977 or 12%. The decrease was
mostly due to the termination of one full time equivalent employee (“FTE”) at the end of 2021.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses were $401,444 in 2022 compared to $324,728 in 2021, an increase of $76,716, or 24%. The reported increase was
attributable to the addition of one marketing FTE in mid-2022 and an increase in travel expenses due to now allowable customer visits and trade
shows.
General and Administrative
General and administrative costs were $3,242,652 in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $3,818,892 in 2021, a decrease of
$576,240 or 15%. The reported decrease was attributable to a decrease in investor relation contracts costs and the cost of issuable shares
associated with these contracts.
Operating Loss
Our operating loss was $4,898,289 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $4,185,147 for the prior year, an increase of $713,142 or
17%. This increase in operating loss was largely attributable to the increase of our inventory reserve of $641,815 and decreases in revenue and
gross margin in 2022.
Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $10,438,565 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to interest expense of $14,450,241 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the corresponding prior period, is
attributable to a reduction of common stock and warrants issued for interest and less accretion of interest and amortization of debt discounts.
Unrealized gain and loss on investment in equity securities
Unrealized gain on investments in equity securities was $3,662 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to an unrealized loss of $457,025
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The reported increase was attributable to the increase in the market price of the Company’s investment in
Nexity. As of December 31, 2022, we held 100,250 shares of common stock of Nexity Global SA, (a Polish publicly traded company).
Loss on extinguishment of liabilities
In connection with payments of interest in common stock and debt extensions, we calculated net losses on extinguishment of liabilities of $751,335
in the year ended December 31, 2022 and net losses of $1,061,073 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is attributable to a
reduction of common stock and warrants issued for interest.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain of $734,077 for the forgiveness of our two PPP loans by the U.S. which reduced our
loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 39

Net Loss attributable to common stockholders
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $17,803,953 or ($1.61) per share, as
compared with a net loss available to common shareholders of $22,685,459 or ($3.42) per share during the year ended December 31, 2021. This
decrease in the loss per share is principally attributable to the 67% increase in weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December
31, 2022 along with a smaller loss for 2022 as explained above.
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
As of December 31, 2022, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities. We have been successful in
raising cash through debt and equity offerings in the past. We have efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings.
We believe our current and projected capital raising plans, and our projected continued increases in revenue, will enable us to extend our cash
resources for the foreseeable future. Although we have successfully completed equity and debt financings and reduced expenses in the past, we
cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.
We believe we will need approximately $12 million in additional capital to fund our three-pronged operational plan, which was designed to help
increase revenues and reach profitability, by:
A. reducing/eliminating debt and cleaning up the balance sheet;
B. funding UST development, instrument build and commercialization;
C. facilitating up-listing PBIO to a major exchange; and
D. providing a minimum of two years of operational and growth capital.
However, if we are unable to obtain such funds through sales, the capital markets or other source of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we
will likely be required to cease our operations, pursue a plan to sell our operating assets, or otherwise modify our business strategy, which could
materially harm our future business prospects. These conditions raise substantive doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Net cash used in operating activities was $4,478,041 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with $4,868,573 for the year ended
December 31, 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $20,755 compared to $122,945 for the year ended December
31, 2021.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $4,370,350 as compared with $5,105,289 for the year
ended December 31, 2021.
Our common stock is currently traded on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets under the trading symbol “PBIO.”
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Battelle Memorial Institute
In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”). The licensed
technology is described in the patent application filed by Battelle on July 31, 2008 (US serial number 12/183,219). This application includes subject
matter related to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples including, through an automated system, utilizing pressure
and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter period of time than current methods, while maintaining the integrity
of the sample throughout the preparatory process. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we paid Battelle a non-refundable initial fee of $35,000.
In addition to royalty payments on net sales on “licensed products,” we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year we retain
the rights outlined in the patent license agreement; and, we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year
following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013, the minimum annual
royalty was $1,200 in 2014 and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties were $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in 2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar
year thereafter during the term of the agreement.

Target Discovery Inc.
In March 2010, we signed a strategic product licensing, manufacturing, co-marketing, and collaborative research and development agreement
with Target Discovery Inc. (“TDI”), a related party. Under the terms of the agreement, we have been licensed by TDI to manufacture and sell a
highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis (“TDI reagents”). The TDI reagents were designed for
use in combination with our pressure cycling technology. The companies believe that the combination of PCT and the TDI reagents can fill an
existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid extraction and recovery of intact, functional proteins associated with cell
membranes in tissue samples. We did not incur any royalty obligation under this agreement in 2022 or 2021.
In April 2012, we signed a non-exclusive license agreement with TDI to grant the non-exclusive use of our pressure cycling technology. We
executed an amendment to this agreement on October 1, 2016 wherein we agreed to pay a monthly fee of $1,400 for the use of a lab bench, shared
space and other utilities, and $2,000 per day for technical support services as needed. The agreement requires TDI to pay the Company a minimum
royalty fee of $60,000 in 2022 and $60,000 in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported expenses of $69,300 and
$82,800, respectively for these arrangements.
Severance and Change of Control Agreements
Each of Mr. Schumacher, Dr. Ting, and Dr. Lazarev, executive officers of the Company, are entitled to receive a severance payment if
terminated by us without cause. The severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of such executive officer’s
annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off. Additionally, the officer will be entitled to receive medical and dental insurance
coverage for one year following the date of termination.
Pursuant to severance agreements with each of Mr. Schumacher, Dr. Ting, and Dr. Lazarev, each such executive officer is entitled to receive a
change of control payment in an amount equal to one year (other than Mr. Schumacher) of such executive officer’s annualized base salary
compensation, accrued paid time off, and medical and dental coverage, in the event the officer is terminated as a result of a change of control of
our Company. In the case of Mr. Schumacher, his payment is equal to two years of annualized base salary compensation, accrued paid time off, and
two years of medical and dental coverage.
Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, any unvested stock options held by a named executive officer will become fully vested upon a change in
control (as defined in the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan) of our Company.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the
notes thereto. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We do not consider any of our policies or estimates to be critical. Refer to Note
3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Management believes its application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting
policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change.
Recent Accounting Standards
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of
the specified effective date. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Accounting for
Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of
applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among
other changes, the new guidance removes the beneficial conversion separation model for convertible debt. As a result, after adopting the guidance,
entities will no longer account for beneficial conversion features in equity. The guidance is effective for public business entities, other than small
reporting company’s financial statements starting January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is a small reporting company and
early adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect of adoption equal
to a $2,728,243 decrease in additional paid in capital and a $2,255,216 decrease in accumulated deficit. There is no material impact to the
Company’s statements of operations or cash flows as the result of the adoption of ASU 2020-06.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 filings are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and
management was necessarily required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As of December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to limited
resources for adequate personnel to prepare and file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the required periods, and material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting for complex equity transactions as described below under the
heading “Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Management plans to remediate this weakness by taking the
actions described below.
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
● pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets;
● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our
management and directors; and
● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013).
Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting because of the effect of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2 defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency, or combination of
significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based upon this definition, our management concluded that, as of December 31,
2022, a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for complex equity transactions.
Specifically, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the following matters:
● We identified a lack of sufficient segregation of duties. Specifically, this material weakness is such that the design over these areas relies
primarily on detective controls and could be strengthened by adding preventative controls to properly safeguard Company assets.
● Management has identified a lack of sufficient personnel in the accounting function due to our limited resources with appropriate skills,
training and experience to perform the review processes to ensure the complete and proper application of generally accepted accounting
principles, particularly as it relates to valuation of warrants and other complex debt /equity transactions. Specifically, this material
weakness resulted in audit adjustments to the annual consolidated financial statements and revisions to related disclosures.
● Limited policies and procedures that cover recording and reporting of financial transactions.
● Lack of multiple levels of review over the financial reporting process
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 43

Our plan to remediate those material weaknesses is as follows:
● Improve the effectiveness of the accounting group by augmenting our existing resources with additional consultants or employees to assist
in the analysis and recording of complex accounting transactions, and to simultaneously achieve desired organizational structuring for
improved segregation of duties. We plan to mitigate this identified deficiency by hiring an independent consultant once we generate
significantly more revenue or raise significant additional working capital.
● Improve expert review and achieve desired segregation procedures by strengthening cross approval of various functions including quarterly
internal audit procedures where appropriate.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

the circumstances (including (a) a subcommittee consisting of a single member and (b) a subcommittee consisting of at least two members, each of
whom qualifies as a “non-employee director,” as such term is defined from time to time in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and an “outside director,” as such term is defined from time to time in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations there under).
Compensation Objectives
In light of the relatively early stage of commercialization of our products, we recognize the importance of attracting and retaining key
employees with sufficient experience, skills, and qualifications in areas vital to our success, such as operations, finance, sales and marketing,
research and development, engineering, and individuals who are committed to our short- and long-term goals. The Compensation Committee has
designed our executive compensation programs with the intent of attracting, motivating, and retaining experienced executives and, subject to our
limited financial resources, rewarding them for their contributions by offering them a competitive base salary, potential for annual cash incentive
bonuses, and long-term equity-based incentives, typically in the form of stock options. The Compensation Committee strives to balance the need to
retain key employees with financial prudence given our history of operating losses, limited financial resources and the early stage of our
commercialization.
Executive Officers and Director Compensation Process
The Compensation Committee considers and determines executive compensation according to an annual objective setting and measurement
cycle. Specifically, corporate goals for the year are initially developed by our executive officers and are then presented to our board of directors
and Compensation Committee for review and approval. Individual goals are intended to focus on contributions that facilitate the achievement of the
corporate goals. Individual goals are first proposed by each executive officer, other than the president and CEO, then discussed by the entire senior
executive management team and ultimately compiled and prepared for submission to our board of directors and the Compensation Committee, by
the president and chief executive officer. The Compensation Committee sets and approves the goals for the president and chief executive officer.
Generally, corporate and individual goals are set during the first quarter of each calendar year. The objective setting process is coordinated with
our annual financial planning and budgeting process so our board of directors and Compensation Committee can consider overall corporate and
individual objectives in the context of budget constraints and cost control considerations. Annual salary increases, bonuses, and equity awards,
such as stock option grants, if any, are tied to the achievement of these corporate and individual performance goals as well as our financial position
and prospects.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K 51

Under the annual performance review program, the Compensation Committee evaluates individual performance against the goals for the
recently completed year. The Compensation Committee’s evaluation generally occurs in the first quarter of the following year. The evaluation of
each executive (other than the president and chief executive officer) begins with a written self-assessment submitted by the executive to the
president and chief executive officer. The president and chief executive officer then prepares a written evaluation based on the executive’s self-
assessment, the president and chief executive officer’s evaluation, and input from others within the Company. This process leads to a
recommendation by the president and chief executive officer for a salary increase, bonus, and equity award, if any, which is then considered by the
Compensation Committee. In the case of the president and chief executive officer, the Compensation Committee conducts his performance
evaluation and determines his compensation, including salary increase, bonus, and equity awards, if any. We generally expect, but are not required,
to implement salary increases, bonuses, and equity awards, for all executive officers, if and to the extent granted, by April 1 of each year.
Non-employee director compensation is set by our board of directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. In developing
its recommendations, the Compensation Committee is guided by the following goals: compensation should be fair relative to the required services
for directors of comparable companies in our industry and at our Company’s stage of development; compensation should align directors’ interests
with the long-term interest of stockholders; the structure of the compensation should be simple, transparent, and easy for stockholders to
understand; and compensation should be consistent with the financial resources, prospects, and competitive outlook for the Company.
In evaluating executive officer and director compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the practices of companies of similar size,
geographic location, and market focus. In order to develop reasonable benchmark data the Compensation Committee has referred to publicly
available sources such as www.salary.com and the BioWorld Survey. While the Compensation Committee does not believe benchmarking is
appropriate as a stand-alone tool for setting compensation due to the unique aspects of our business objectives and current stage of development,
the Compensation Committee generally believes that gathering this compensation information is an important part of its compensation-related
decision making process.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to hire and fire advisors and compensation consultants as needed and approve their fees. No
advisors or compensation consultants were hired or fired in fiscal 2021. The Compensation Committee is also authorized to delegate any of its
responsibilities to sub committees or individuals as it deems appropriate. The Compensation Committee did not delegate any of its responsibilities
in fiscal 2021.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS; AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The following is a summary of transactions since January 1, 2020 to which we have been or will be a party in which the amount involved
exceeded or will exceed $25,675 (one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for our last two completed fiscal years) and in which
any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of any class of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of,
or person sharing a household with, any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation
arrangements that are described under the section captioned “Executive Compensation.”
In March 2010, we signed a strategic product licensing, manufacturing, co-marketing, and collaborative research and development agreement
with Target Discovery Inc. (“TDI”), a related party. Under the terms of the agreement, we have been licensed by TDI to manufacture and sell a
highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis (“TDI reagents”). The TDI reagents were designed for
use in combination with our pressure cycling technology. The respective companies believe that the combination of PCT and the TDI reagents can
fill an existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid extraction and recovery of intact, functional proteins associated with
cell membranes in tissue samples. We did not incur any royalty obligation under this agreement in 2017 or 2016. We executed an amendment to
this agreement on October 1, 2016 wherein we agreed to pay a monthly fee of $1,400 for the use of a lab bench, shared space and other utilities,
and $2,000 per day for technical support services as needed. Mr. Jeffrey N. Peterson, the chief executive officer of TDI, has served as a director of
the Company since July 2011 and as Chairman of the Board starting in 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we reported
expenses of $82,800 and $69,300, respectively for these arrangements.
Related Party Notes
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received short-term non-convertible loans of $958,100 from related parties and made payments
of $315,300, for an ending balance of $634,885, which includes an unamortized debt discount of $7,915. At December 31, 2021 there were no
related parties loans outstanding.
Board Independence
Our board of directors has reviewed the qualifications of each of Messrs. Peterson, Mangiardi, Pollack, and Dr. Urdea constituting more than a
majority of our directors and has affirmatively determined that each individual is “independent” as such term is defined under the current listing
standards of the OTC Markets. The board of directors has determined that none of these directors has a material relationship with us that would
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee is independent as required under Section
10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Pressure Biosciences, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pressure Biosciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the
years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Matter
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to
the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring negative cash flows from operations and has a working capital deficit that raises
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved
our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

PRESSURE BIOSCIENCES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Business Overview
Pressure Biosciences, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “the Company”) develops and sells innovative, broadly enabling, high pressure-based platform
technologies and related consumables for the worldwide life sciences, agriculture, food and beverage, and other key industries. Our solutions are
based on the unique properties of both constant (i.e., static) and alternating (i.e., pressure cycling technology, or “PCT”) hydrostatic pressure. PCT
is a patented enabling technology platform that uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels to safely and
reproducibly control bio-molecular interactions (e.g., cell lysis, biomolecule extraction). Historically, our primary focus has been in the development
of PCT-based products for biomarker and target discovery, drug design and development, biotherapeutics characterization and quality control, soil
& plant biology, forensics, and counter-bioterror applications. In more recent years, major new market opportunities have emerged in the use of
our pressure-based technologies in the following areas: (1) the use of our recently acquired, patented technology from BaroFold, Inc. (the
“BaroFold” technology) to allow entry into the bio-pharma contract services sector, and (2) the use of our recently-patented, scalable, high-
efficiency, pressure-based Ultra Shear Technology (“UST”) platform to (i) create stable nanoemulsions of otherwise immiscible fluids (e.g., oils and
water) and to (ii) prepare higher quality, homogenized, extended shelf-life or room temperature stable low-acid liquid foods that cannot be
effectively preserved using existing non-thermal technologies.
On February 8, 2021, PBI announced plans to acquire the assets of a global eco-friendly agrochemical supplier. On April 14, 2021, PBI finalized
terms and executed a new letter of intent to purchase the assets of the agrochemical supplier. This opportunity is attractive as it has the potential
of readily producing significant revenue, as well as the potential to apply the UST technology to improve some of the product line. In July 2021, a
newly formed subsidiary of PBI, PBI Agrochem, leased a warehouse in Carson City, NV, and hired a warehouse manager.
(2) Going Concern
We have experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have adequate working
capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities and as a result we have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.. We
have been successful in raising debt and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 9 and 10. In addition, we raised debt and equity capital
after December 31, 2022 as described in Note 11. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings.
Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these
matters in the future will be successful. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.
The conditions described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and may cause
investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects and may adversely affect our relationships with customers. If we cannot successfully
continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment.
(3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
i. Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pressure BioSciences, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries PBI BioSeq, Inc and
PBI Agrochem, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-8

ii. Use of Estimates
To prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. In addition, significant estimates were made in deferred tax assets, the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the
instruments that we sell, and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ
from the estimates and assumptions used.
iii Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard is effective for the
Company for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Accounting for
Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of
applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among
other changes, the new guidance removes the beneficial conversion separation model for convertible debt. As a result, after adopting the guidance,
entities will no longer account for beneficial conversion features in equity. The guidance is effective for public business entities, other than small
reporting company’s financial statements starting January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company is a small reporting company and
early adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect of adoption equal
to a $2,728,243 decrease in additional paid in capital and a $2,255,216 decrease in accumulated deficit, which results in an increase in total
stockholder’s deficit of $473,027. There is no material impact to the Company’s statements of operations or cash flows as the result of the adoption
of ASU 2020-06.
iv. Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred
Costs—Contracts with Customers. Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales
incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We enter sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations
where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period. We measure and allocate revenue according
to ASC 606-10.
We identify a performance obligation as distinct if both the following criteria are true: the customer can benefit from the good or service either
on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the
customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of
consideration from a contract to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, is the result of
significant qualitative and quantitative judgments. Management considers a variety of factors such as historical sales, usage rates, costs, and
expected margin, which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making
these estimates. While changes in the allocation of the SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized
for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which would have a material effect on our financial
position and result of operations. This is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation, delivered or undelivered,
at the inception of the contract based on the SSP of each distinct performance obligation.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are
collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a
fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of revenues as consistent with treatment in prior periods.
Our current Barocycler instruments require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set-up for initial operation. To support a favorable first
experience for our customers, upon customer request, and for an additional fee, we will send a highly trained technical representative to the
customer site to install Barocyclers that we sell, lease, or rent through our domestic sales force. The installation process includes uncrating and
setting up the instrument, followed by introductory user training. Our sales arrangements do not provide our customers with a right of return. Any
shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-9

Most of our instrument and consumable contracts contain pricing that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our
obligations to deliver product volumes are typically satisfied and revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to our customers.
Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to payment for the shipped product and the customer has significant risks
and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing
components.
Revenue from scientific services customers is recognized upon completion of each stage of service as defined in service agreements.
We apply ASC 845, “Accounting for Non-Monetary Transactions”, to account for products and services sold through non-cash transactions
based on the fair values of the products and services involved, where such values can be determined. Non-cash exchanges would require revenue to
be recognized at recorded cost or carrying value of the assets or services sold if any of the following conditions apply:
a) The fair value of the asset or service involved is not determinable.
b) The transaction is an exchange of a product or property held for sale in the ordinary course of business for a product or property to be sold
in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers other than the parties to the exchange.
c) The transaction lacks commercial substance.
We recognize revenue for non-cash transactions at recorded cost or carrying value of the assets or services sold.
We account for lease agreements of our instruments in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. We record revenue over the life of the lease term and
we record depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the thirty-six-month estimated useful life of the Barocycler instrument. The
depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included in the “Cost of PCT products and services” line item in our
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Many of our lease and rental agreements allow the lessee to purchase the instrument at any
point during the term of the agreement with partial or full credit for payments previously made. We pay all maintenance costs associated with the
instrument during the term of the leases.
Revenue from government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award.
Deferred revenue represents amounts received from grants and service contracts for which the related revenues have not been recognized
because one or more of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met. Revenue from service contracts is recorded ratably over the length of
the contract.

All consideration from contracts with customers is included in the amounts presented above.
Contract Costs
The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that
the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The
costs to obtain a contract are recorded immediately in the period when the revenue is recognized either upon shipment or installation. The costs to
obtain a service contract are considered immaterial when spread over the life of the contract so the Company records the costs immediately upon
billing.
v. Beneficial Conversion Features
In accordance with FASB ASC 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” the Company records a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”)
related to the issuance of convertible debt or preferred stock instruments that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in-the-money when
issued. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of
that feature to additional paid-in capital. The intrinsic value is generally calculated at the commitment date as the difference between the
conversion price and the fair value of the common stock or other securities into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of
shares into which the security is convertible. If certain other securities are issued with the convertible security, the proceeds are allocated among
the different components. The portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible security is divided by the contractual number of the conversion
shares to determine the effective conversion price, which is used to measure the BCF. The effective conversion price is used to compute the
intrinsic value. The value of the BCF is limited to the basis that is initially allocated to the convertible security.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-11

vi. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our policy is to invest available cash in short-term, investment grade interest-bearing obligations, including money market funds, and bank and
corporate debt instruments. Securities purchased with initial maturities of three months or less are valued at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates fair value, and are classified as cash equivalents.
vii. Research and Development
Research and development costs, which are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including wages and
associated employee benefits, facilities, consumable products and overhead costs that are expensed as incurred. In support of our research and
development activities we utilize our Barocycler instruments that are capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated over their expected useful life.
viii. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (average cost) or net realizable value. The cost of Barocyclers consists of the cost charged by the
contract manufacturer. The cost of manufactured goods includes material, freight-in, direct labor, and applicable overhead. The composition of
inventory as of December 31, is as follows:
2022 2021
Raw materials $ 188,587 $ 296,892
Finished goods 1,480,769 1,193,158
Inventory reserve (982,973) (342,496)
Total $ 686,383 $ 1,147,554
ix. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is recognized using
the straight-line method, allocating the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives of three years for certain laboratory equipment, from
three to five years for management information systems and office equipment, and three years for all PCT finished units classified as fixed assets.
x. Intangible Assets
We have classified as intangible assets, costs associated with the fair value of acquired intellectual property. Intangible assets, including
patents, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over nine years. We perform an annual review of our intangible assets for impairment. We
capitalize any costs to renew or extend the term of our intangible assets. When impairment is indicated, any excess of carrying value over fair value
is recorded as a loss. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the outstanding balance for intangible assets was $317,308 and $403,846, respectively.
xi. Long-Lived Assets
The Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the FASB ASC 360-10-05, Property, Plant, and
Equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had not experienced impairment losses on its long-
lived assets.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-12

xii. Concentrations
Credit Risk
Our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade
receivables. We have cash investment policies which, among other things, limit investments to investment-grade securities. We perform ongoing
credit evaluations of our customers, and the risk with respect to trade receivables is further mitigated by the fact that many of our customers are
government institutions and university labs. Allowances are provided for estimated amounts of accounts receivable which may not be collected. At
December 31, 2022, we determined that no allowance against accounts receivable was necessary.

As of December 31, 2022, we held 100,250 shares of common stock of Nexity Global SA, (a Polish publicly traded company). On October 23,
2020 Everest Investments S.A. changed its name to Nexity Global S.A. Nexity is and Everest was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
We had exchanged 33,334 shares of our common stock for the 100,250 shares we had held in Everest (before the Nexity Merger). We account
for this investment in accordance with ASC 320 “Investments — Debt and Equity Securities.” ASC 320 requires equity investments with readily
determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated balance sheet reflected the fair value, determined on a recurring basis based on Level 1 inputs, of
our investment in Nexity to be $63,638. We recorded $3,662 as unrealized gain during the year ended December 31, 2022 for changes in market
value.
As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet reflected the fair value, determined on a recurring basis based on Level 1 inputs, of
our investment in Nexity to be $59,976. We recorded $457,025 as unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 for changes in
market value.
xiii. Computation of Loss per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. For
purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, common stock dividends, warrants to acquire preferred stock convertible into common
stock, and warrants and options to acquire common stock, are all considered common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive
effect and are excluded from this calculation in periods in which these are anti-dilutive. The following table illustrates our computation of loss per
share for the years ended December 31:
2022 2021
Numerator:
Net loss attributable to common shareholders $ (17,803,953) $ (22,685,459)
Denominator for basic and diluted loss per share:
Weighted average common shares outstanding 11,058,356 6,636,523
Loss per common share - basic and diluted $ (1.61) $ (3.42)
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-13

The following table presents securities that could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future. For all periods presented, the potentially
dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because these securities would have been anti-dilutive for the
years ended December 31:
2022 2021
Stock options 1,307,822 1,333,101
Convertible debt 6,915,754 5,232,118
Common stock warrants 16,278,769 16,207,108

Series AA Convertible Preferred 8,645,000 8,649,000
33,647,137 31,921,119
xiv. Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets, subject to valuation
allowances, and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or
tax returns. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our
deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carry-
forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than
not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. If substantial changes in the Company’s ownership should occur, as
defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, there could be significant limitations on the amount of net loss carry forwards that could be
used to offset future taxable income.
Tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. No interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued on December 31,
2022 and 2021.
xv. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
We maintain equity compensation plans under which incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are granted to employees,
independent members of our Board of Directors and outside consultants. We recognize equity compensation expense over the requisite service
period using the Black-Scholes formula to estimate the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant. Employee and non-employee awards are
accounted for under ASC 718 where the awards are valued at grant date.
Determining Fair Value of Stock Option Grants
Valuation and Amortization Method - The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing
model based on certain assumptions. The estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense using the straight-line method
over the vesting period, which generally is over three years.
Expected Term - The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected life, described in the FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation, as the Company does not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term. Using this
method, the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted.
Expected Volatility - Expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the award.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-14

Risk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield
currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.
Forfeitures - As required by FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, the Company records stock-based compensation expense only
for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimated a forfeiture rate of 5% for awards granted based on historical experience and
future expectations of options vesting. We used this historical rate as our assumption in calculating future stock-based compensation expense.
The following table summarizes the assumptions we utilized for grants of stock options to the three sub-groups of our stock option recipients
during the year ended December 31, 2021 (there were no options granted in 2022):
CEO, other Officers
Assumptions and Employees
Expected life 6.0(yrs)
Expected volatility 155.02%
Risk-free interest rate 0.62%
Forfeiture rate 5.00%
Expected dividend yield 0.0%
We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $215,098 and $254,615 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The following table summarizes the effect of this stock-based compensation expense within each of the line items within our accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31:
2022 2021
Research and development $ 79,891 $ 128,094
Selling and marketing 24,687 22,233
General and administrative 110,520 104,288
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 215,098 $ 254,615
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the total fair value of stock options awarded was $0 and $49,135,
respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested stock-based awards was $15,312, which is expected to
be recognized over weighted average period of 1.09 years.
As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested stock-based awards was $140,455, which is expected to
be recognized over weighted average period of 1.09 years.
xvi. Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. We incurred $487 in 2022 and $17,594 in 2021 for advertising.
xvii. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Due to their short maturities, the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and
debt approximate their fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value due to interest rates that approximate prevailing
market rates.
xviii. Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) as it related to financial
assets and financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-15

The Company generally defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies
the inputs used in measuring fair values. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments
in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level
3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company has determined that its financial assets are currently classified within Level 1. The Company does not have any financial liabilities
that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
The following tables set forth the Company’s financial assets that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,
2022:

Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-16

(5) Intangible Assets
Intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 reflect the purchase price attributable to patents received in connection with the acquisition of
assets of BaroFold Corp. Acquired BaroFold patents are being amortized to expense on a straight line basis at the rate of $80,000 per year over
their estimated remaining useful lives of approximately 9 years. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of approximately four
succeeding fiscal years is $80,000 annually. We performed a review of our intangible assets for impairment. When impairment is indicated, any
excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss. An impairment analysis of intangible assets was performed as of December 31, 2022.
We have concluded that there is no impairment of intangible assets. Intangible assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following:
December 31,
2022 2021
BaroFold Patents $ 750,000 $ 750,000
Less accumulated amortization (432,692) (346,154)
Net book value $ 317,308 $ 403,846
Amortization expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $86,538 for both years.
(6) Retirement Plan
We provide all our employees with the opportunity to participate in our retirement savings plan. Our retirement savings plan has been qualified
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees are permitted to contribute to the plan through payroll deductions within
statutory limitations and subject to any limitations included in the plan. During 2022 and 2021 we contributed $12,777 and $11,752, respectively,
in the form of discretionary Company-matching contributions.
(7) Income Taxes
Tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. No interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued at December 31,
2022 and 2021. Our tax returns for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are open to examination.
Significant items making up the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:
2022 2021
Long term deferred taxes:
Inventory reserve $ 268,548 $ 93,570
Other accruals 99,362 91,792
Other 15,715 15,169
Non-cash, stock-based compensation, nonqualified 872,967 814,202
Impairment loss on investment 104,609 104,609
Operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 31,026,899 28,435,535
Less: valuation allowance (32,388,100) (29,554,877)
Total net deferred tax assets $ - $ -
A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly,
we established a valuation allowance in 2022 and 2021 for the full amount of our deferred tax assets for the uncertainty of realization. We believe
that based on our projection of future taxable operating income for the foreseeable future, it is more likely than not that we will not be able to
realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2022.
We have net operating loss carry-forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $110,385,351 as of December 31, 2022. Included in
these numbers are loss carry-forwards that were obtained through the acquisition of BioSeq, Inc. and are subject to Section 382 NOL limitations.
These net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates from 2023 through 2037. Under the Tax Reform Act, NOL’s generated after
December 31, 2017 can offset only 80% of a corporation’s taxable income in any year. With limited exceptions, NOL’s generated after 2017,
$70,711,859, cannot be carried back, but they can be carried forward indefinitely.
We have net operating loss carry-forwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $106,651,967 at December 31, 2022. These net
operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates from 2031 through 2038.
We have research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,338,308 as of December 31,
2022 and research and development tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $356,424 as of December 31, 2022.
The federal credit carryforwards expire at various dates from 2022 through 2037. The state credit carryforwards expire at various dates from 2023
through 2034.

Operating Leases
The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842. The Company has elected to apply the short-term lease exception to leases of one year or
less.
Our corporate office is currently located at 14 Norfolk Avenue, South Easton, Massachusetts 02375. We are currently paying $7,650 per month,
on a lease extension, signed on December 5, 2022, that expires December 31, 2023, for our corporate office. We expanded our space to include
offices, warehouse and a loading dock on the first floor starting May 1, 2017 with a monthly rent increase already reflected in the current
payments.
We extended our lease for our space in Medford, MA (the “Medford Lease”) from December 30, 2020 to December 30, 2023. The lease required
monthly payments of $7,282 subject to annual cost of living increases. The lease shall be automatically extended for additional three years unless
either party terminates at least six months prior to the expiration of the current lease term.
The Company accounted for the lease extension of our Medford Lease as a lease modification under ASC 842. At the effective date of
modification, the Company recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $221,432 based on the net present
value of lease payments discounted using an estimated borrowing rate of 12%.
On August 9, 2021, we entered into an operating lease agreement for our warehouse space in Sparks, NV (the “Sparks Lease”) for the period
from September 1, 2021 through September 30, 2026. The lease contains escalating payments during the lease period. The lease can be extended
for an additional three years if the Company provides notice at least six months prior to the expiration of the current lease term.
The Company accounted for the Sparks Lease as an operating lease under ASC 842. Upon the commencement of the lease, the Company
recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of $239,327 based on the net present value of lease payments discounted using an
estimated borrowing rate of 12%.

Battelle Memorial Institute
In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”). The licensed
technology is the subject of a patent application filed by Battelle in 2008 and relates to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein
samples, including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter
period than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. In addition to royalty payments on
net sales on “licensed products,” we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent
license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the
patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013, the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 in 2014
and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties were $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in 2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar year thereafter during the
term of the agreement.
Target Discovery Inc.
In March 2010, we signed a strategic product licensing, manufacturing, co-marketing, and collaborative research and development agreement
with Target Discovery Inc. (“TDI”), a related party. Under the terms of the agreement, we have been licensed by TDI to manufacture and sell a
highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis (“TDI reagents”). The TDI reagents were designed for
use in combination with our pressure cycling technology. The companies believe that the combination of PCT and the TDI reagents can fill an
existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid extraction and recovery of intact, functional proteins associated with cell
membranes in tissue samples. We did not incur any royalty obligation under this agreement in 2022 or 2021.
In April 2012, we signed a non-exclusive license agreement with TDI to grant the non-exclusive use of our pressure cycling technology. We
executed an amendment to this agreement on October 1, 2016 wherein we agreed to pay a monthly fee of $1,400 for the use of a lab bench, shared
space and other utilities, and $2,000 per day for technical support services as needed. The agreement requires TDI to pay the Company a minimum
royalty fee of $60,000 in 2022 and $60,000 in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported expenses of $69,300 and
$82,800, respectively for these arrangements.
Severance and Change of Control Agreements
Each of Mr. Schumacher, and Drs. Ting, and Lazarev, executive officers of the Company, are entitled to receive a severance payment if
terminated by us without cause. The severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of such executive officer’s
annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off. Additionally, the officer will be entitled to receive medical and dental insurance
coverage for one year following the date of termination.
Each of these executive officers, other than Mr. Schumacher, is entitled to receive a change of control payment in an amount equal to one year
of such executive officer’s annualized base salary compensation, accrued paid time off, and medical and dental coverage, in the event of their
termination upon a change of control of the Company. In the case of Mr. Schumacher, this payment would be equal to two years of annualized base
salary compensation, accrued paid time off, and two years of medical and dental coverage. The severance payment is meant to induce the
aforementioned executives to remain in the employ of the Company, in general, and particularly in the occurrence of a change in control, as a
disincentive to the control change.
(9) Debt
Convertible Debt
On various dates during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued convertible notes for net proceeds of approximately $4.9
million which contained varied terms and conditions as follows: a) 1-12 month maturity date; b) interest rates of 0-18% per annum c) convertible to
the Company’s common stock at issuance at a fixed rate of $2.50 or at variable conversion rates upon the Company’s up-listing to NASDAQ or
NYSE or an event of default. These notes were issued with shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock that were fairly valued
at issuance dates. The aggregate relative fair value of the shares of common stock issued with the notes of $873,854 was recorded as a debt
discount to be amortized over the term of the notes. The aggregate relative fair value of the warrants issued with the notes of $93,576 was also
recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the notes. Deferred financing costs and OID issued with the debt are $541,313 and the
Company repaid $1,522,494 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Finally, we evaluated our convertible notes for derivative liability treatment on
an on-going basis and have determined that all our notes did not qualify for derivative accounting treatment at December 31, 2022. In the year
ended December 31, 2022 the amortization of debt discount on convertible notes was $1,694,028.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-19

On various dates during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued convertible notes for net proceeds of approximately $5.5
million which contained varied terms and conditions as follows: a) 6-12 month maturity date; b) interest rates of 10-18% per annum and c)
convertible to the Company’s common stock at issuance at fixed rates of $2.50 and $3.00 or at a variable conversion rates upon the Company’s up-
listing to NASDAQ or NYSE or an event of default. These notes were issued with shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock
that were fair valued at issuance dates. The aggregate relative fair value of the shares of common stock issued with the notes of $646,718 was
recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the notes. The aggregate relative fair value of $1.4 million for the warrants issued
with the notes was recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the notes. We then computed the effective conversion price of the
notes and recorded a BCF of $1.3 million as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the notes. Finally, we evaluated our convertible notes
for derivative liability treatment on an on-going basis and have determined that all our notes did not qualify for derivative accounting treatment at
December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2021 the amortization of debt discount on convertible notes was approximately $6.7 million.
The summary of specific terms of the convertible notes and outstanding balances as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are listed in
the tables below. The convertible notes are from numerous parties and with original issue dates from June, 2019 to December, 2022, and maturity
dates from March, 2020 to December, 2023. There are approximately $12 million of notes that are past due as of December 31, 2022.

Standstill and Forbearance Agreements
The Company has entered into Standstill and Forbearance Agreements with lenders who hold variable-rate convertible notes with a total
principal as of December 31, 2022 of $574,984. Pursuant to the Standstill and Forbearance Agreements, the lenders agreed to not convert any
portion of their notes into shares of common stock at a variable rate until March 31, 2021 for convertible notes with a principal balance of $469,000
and until April 16, 2021 for convertible notes with a principal balance of $1.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
settled one note with total principal of $166,703, leaving two final lenders (four notes) with total principal of $574,984 outstanding and incurred
interest, penalties and fees of approximately $0.8 million in connection with the Standstill and Forbearance Agreement. During the year ended
December 31, 2021, the Company settled three lenders (five notes) with a total principal of $827,500 and incurred interest, penalties, and fees of
approximately $1.47 million in connection with the Standstill and forbearance agreements.
Convertible Loan Modifications and Extinguishments
We refinanced certain convertible loans during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 at substantially the same terms for extensions
ranging over a period of three to six months. We amortized any remaining unamortized debt discount as of the modification date over the
remaining, extended term of the new loans. We applied ASC 470 of modification accounting to the debt instruments which were modified during
the period or those settled with new notes issued concurrently for the same amounts but different maturity dates. The terms such as the interest
rate, prepayment penalties, and default rates will be the same over the new extensions. According to ASC 470, an exchange of debt instruments
between or a modification of a debt instrument by a debtor and a creditor in a nontroubled debt situation is deemed to have been accomplished
with debt instruments that are substantially different if the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument is at least
10 percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. If the terms of a debt
instrument are changed or modified and the cash flow effect on a present value basis is less than 10 percent, the debt instruments are not
considered to be substantially different and will be accounted for as modifications.
The cash flows of new debt exceeded 10% of the remaining cash flows of the original debt on several loans in 2022 and 2021. We recorded
losses on extinguishment of liabilities of $751,335 in 2022 and $1,061,073 in 2021. Our gains and losses were measured by calculating the
difference of the fair value of the new debt and the carrying value of the old debt.
Other Debt
On October 11, 2019 we received a non-convertible loan with a one month term and a 2% interest charge for $25,000 from a private investor. In
the year ended December 31,2021 the Company issued 17 shares of Series AA preferred stock and 17,000 warrants to acquire common stock (five
year term and $3.50 exercise price) to the investor to settle principal and interest on this loan.
No notes in Other Debt are past due as of December 31, 2022.

convertible debt is past due.
(2) The Company entered into a COVID-19 government loan in 2020, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (or “EIDL”). The Company’s EIDL loan,
$150,000, accrues interest at 3.75% and requires monthly payments of $731 for principal and interest beginning in December 2022. The
balance of the principal will be due in 30 years. In connection with the EIDL loan the Company entered into a security agreement with the
SBA, whereby the Company granted the SBA a security interest in all of the Company’s right, title and interest in all of the Company’s
assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company borrowed $367,039 (two-year term and 1% interest rate per annum) under
Payroll Protection program (or “2020 PPP”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company borrowed $367,039 through a second
Payroll Protection program (or “2021 PPP”) and extended the monthly payment date on the EIDL to December 2022. In year 2021, both
2020 PPP and 2021 PPP was forgiven by the United States and SBA.
(3) During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we signed various Merchant Agreements which are secured by second position rights
to all customer receipts until the loan has been repaid in full and subject to interest rates of 4.1% - 14% per month. Under the terms of these
agreements, we received the disclosed Purchase Price and agreed to repay the disclosed Purchase Amount, which is collected by the
Merchant lenders at the Daily Payment Rate. We accounted for the Merchant Agreements as loans under ASC 860 because while we
provided rights to current and future receipts, we still had control over the receipts. The difference between the Purchase Amount and the
Purchase Price is imputed interest that is recorded as interest expense when paid each day. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer
guarantees the Company’s performance of all representations, warranties, and covenants made by the Company in the Agreement. For loans
outstanding on December 31, 2022, the maturity dates ranged from April 4, 2023 to June 6, 2023. For loan outstanding on December 31,
2021, the maturity dates ranged from January 7 to January 11, 2022.

Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”) convertible into 84 shares of our
common stock, (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalization, etc.) and (ii) one five-year warrant to purchase
approximately 21 shares of our common stock at a per share exercise price of $24.30, subject to adjustment as provided in the Warrants (“Series D
Warrant”). The Series D Warrants were exercisable beginning on May 11, 2012 and until the close of business on the fifth anniversary of the initial

The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will rank senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to payments made upon liquidation,
winding up or dissolution. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, after payment of the Company’s debts and liabilities,
and before any payment is made to the holders of any junior securities, the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will first be entitled to
be paid $1,000 per share subject to adjustment for accrued but unpaid dividends.
We may not pay any dividends on shares of common stock unless we also pay dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in the same
form and amount, on an as-if-converted basis, as dividends actually paid on shares of our common stock. Except for such dividends, no other
dividends may be paid on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 84 shares of common stock (based upon an initial conversion price of
$19.50 per share) at any time at the option of the holder, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, and similar
recapitalization transactions (the “Series D Conversion Ratio”). Subject to certain exceptions, if the Company issues any shares of common stock or
common stock equivalents at a per share price that is lower than the conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the conversion
price will be reduced to the per share price at which such shares of common stock or common stock equivalents are issued. Each share of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the Series D Conversion Ratio then in effect if, after six
months from the closing of the Series D Placement, the common stock trades on the OTCQB (or other primary trading market or exchange on which
the common stock is then traded) at a price equal to at least 300% of the then effective Series D Convertible Preferred Stock conversion price for
20 out of 30 consecutive trading days with each trading day having a volume of at least $50,000. Unless waived under certain circumstances by the
holder of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may not be converted if upon such
conversion the holder’s beneficial ownership would exceed certain thresholds.
In addition, in the event we consummate a merger or consolidation with or into another person or other reorganization event in which our
shares of common stock are converted or exchanged for securities, cash or other property, or we sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of our assets or we or another person acquire 50% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, then following such event,
the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock the
same kind and amount of securities, cash or property which the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would have received had they
converted the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to such fundamental transaction.
The holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote on any matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for
their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), except that
the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may vote separately as a class on any matters that would (i) amend, our Restated Articles of
Organization, as amended, in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) alter or change adversely
the powers, preferences or rights of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock or alter or amend the certificate of designation, (iii) authorize or
create any class of shares ranking as to dividends, redemption or distribution of assets upon liquidation senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, or (iv) increase the number of authorized shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.
If, within 12 months of the initial issuance of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, we issue any common stock, common stock equivalents,
indebtedness or any combination thereof (a “Subsequent Financing”), the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to
participate on a pro-rata basis in up to 50% of such Subsequent Financing.

Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrants
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with accredited investors pursuant to
which the Company sold an aggregate of 406 shares of Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock, each preferred share convertible into 1,000 shares
of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for an aggregate Purchase price of approximately $1,015,000. We issued to the
investors warrants to purchase an aggregate 406,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.50 per share. The Company did not incur
any placement agent fees for this transaction. The relative fair value of warrants is $509,130. In this time the Company also issued 200 shares of
Series AA Preferred Stock and 200,100 warrants to acquire common stock (five year term and $3.50 exercise price) for settlement of liabilities,
including accrued expense, accrued Compensation to employees and non-convertible debt and related interest. The relative fair value of warrants is
$245,635. The Company also recognized a $23,004 loss on settlement of liabilities, which is included in losses on extinguishment of liabilities on the
consolidated statement of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, there was 4,400 common stock issued for preferred stock conversions from Series AA Convertible
Preferred Stock. During year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company accrued dividend for the amount of $1,727,275 and $1,658,175,
respectively to holders of Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock
The issuances of our convertible preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants are accounted for under the fair value and relative fair
value method.
Pressure BioSciences, Inc. December 31, 2022 Form 10K F-27

The warrant is first analyzed per its terms as to whether it has derivative features or not. If the warrant is determined to be a derivative, then it
is measured at fair value using the Black Scholes Option Model and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The warrant is re-measured at its
then current fair value at each subsequent reporting date (it is “marked-to-market”).
If the warrant is determined to not have derivative features, it is recorded into equity at its fair value using the Black Scholes option model,
however, limited to a relative fair value based upon the percentage of its fair value to the total fair value including the fair value of the convertible
preferred stock.
We analyzed these warrants issued in 2021 and determined that they were not considered derivatives and therefore recorded the aggregate
relative fair value of $509,130 into equity relating to the 406,000 investor warrants issued during 2021.
The convertible preferred stock is recorded at its fair value, limited to a relative fair value based upon the percentage of its fair value to the
total fair value including the fair value of the warrant. Further, the convertible preferred stock is examined for any intrinsic beneficial conversion
feature (“BCF”) of which the convertible price of the preferred stock is less than the closing stock price on date of issuance. If the relative fair value
method is used to value the convertible preferred stock and there is an intrinsic BCF, a further analysis is undertaken of the BCF using an effective
conversion price which assumes the conversion price is the relative fair value divided by the number of shares of common stock the convertible
preferred stock is converted into by its terms. The adjusted BCF value of $0 and $873,798 was accounted for as a deemed dividend within equity
and was included in the earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company did not
recognize any BCF for the year ended December 31, 2022, since the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022.

stock is created via the filing of a Certificate of Designation with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These 400.6885 shares of preferred stock
will be convertible into approximately 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
