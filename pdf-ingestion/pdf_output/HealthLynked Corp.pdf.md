PART I.
Item 1. Business
Overview
HealthLynked Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,”) is a growth stage company incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 6, 2014. We
currently operate in three distinct divisions: the Health Services Division, the Digital Healthcare Division, and the Medical Distribution Division.
The Health Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) Naples Women’s Center (“NWC”), a multi-specialty medical group
including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology) and General Practice, (ii) Naples Center for Functional Medicine (“NCFM”), a Functional
Medical Practice engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care, (iii) Bridging the Gap Physical
Therapy (“BTG”), a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida that provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed
patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery, and (iv) Aesthetic Enhancements Unlimited (“AEU”), a patient service
facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services acquired by the Company in May 2022.
The Digital Healthcare division develops and operates an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked
Network,” which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system.
The Medical Distribution Division is comprised of the operations of MedOffice Direct LLC (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted
medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States.
Sale of ACO Health Partners
During October 2022, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell our ACO/MSO (Accountable Care Organization / Managed
Service Organization) Division, comprised of the operations of Cura Health Management LLC (“CHM”) and its subsidiary ACO Health Partners LLC
(“AHP”), which operate an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) and Managed Service Organization (“MSO”) that assists physician practices in
providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) as administered by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”). On January 17, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “AHP Merger
Agreement”) pursuant to which PBACO Holding, LLC, an operator of ACOs (“Buyer”), agreed to buy, and we agreed to sell, AHP (the “AHP Sale”).
Concurrent with the AHP Merger Agreement, AHP and the Buyer also entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “MSA”),
pursuant to which the Buyer assumed full control of managing AHP’s business operations and paying AHP’s operating expenses after January 16,
2023. Concurrent with the AHP Merger Agreement and the MSA, and as a result of the Buyer assuming control and responsibility of AHP’s
operations, we discontinued our operations of CHM.
Health Services Division
In August 2014, we acquired NWC, an Obstetrical and Gynecological practice in Naples, Florida established in 1996 that provides medical
services to female patients in the Southwest Florida region.
1

In April 2019, we acquired a 100% interest in Hughes Center for Functional Medicine (“HCFM”), a medical practice engaged in improving
the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care. HCFM, which was rebranded as NCFM upon acquisition, is a leader in
functional medicine focusing on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis. NCFM employs three
physicians, four nurses and support staff. NCFM provides cutting-edge treatments to improve health and slow aging, including hormones, thyroid
treatment, weight loss, wellness and prevention. NCFM’s income streams are derived from Medical Membership fees,, patient office visits, a
dedicated IV room, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, ozone, UVlrx, and the sale of supplements.
In May 2022, we acquired AEU, a patient service facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services including fat
reduction, body sculpting, wrinkle reduction, hair removal, IV hydration, and feminine rejuvenation.
In January 2020, we launched a new physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida called Bridging the Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”).
BTG employs one physical therapist who provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain
without pain medication or surgery.
Medical Distribution Division
In October 2020, we acquired MOD, a Naples, Florida-based virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and
medical practices throughout the United States. With over 15,000 name brand medical products in over 150 different categories, MOD leverages
Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) pricing discounts with a small unit-of-measure direct-to-consumer shipping model to make ordering medical
supplies both convenient and highly cost-effective for its users. The MOD online marketplace can be found at www.medofficedirect.com.
Digital HealthCare Division
We operate a cloud-based Patient Information Network (PIN) and record archiving system, referred to as the “HealthLynked Network”,
which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. Through our website,
www.HealthLynked.com and our mobile apps, patients can complete a detailed online personal medical history including past surgical history,
medications, allergies, and family medical history. Once this information is entered, patients and their treating physicians can update the
information as needed, to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date medical history.
We believe that the HealthLynked Network offers several advantages to patients and physicians not available in the market today. We
provide a comprehensive marketing solution allowing physicians to market to both active and inactive patients, and an easy-to-use connection at
the point of care through our Patient Access Hub (“PAH”). Patient members can access medical newsfeeds and groups. Our real-time appointment
scheduling application allows patients to book appointments online with participating and non-participating healthcare providers through our call
center. Our database and record archives allow for seamless sharing of medical records between healthcare providers and keeps patients in control
of shared access. In the HealthLynked Network, parents can create accounts for their children that are linked to their family account, allowing
them to provide access to healthcare providers, track vaccination records, and allow hospitals and schools access to important medical information
in case of emergencies. The HealthLynked Network is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, via the internet and on mobile applications for both
Android and iOS devices. We believe this type of accessibility is important for schools and during office visits, but more important, in times of a
medical emergency.
We anticipate that our system will also provide 24-hour access to medical specialist healthcare providers who can answer medical questions
and direct appropriate care to paying members. In addition to 24-hour access, patients may also schedule telemedicine consultations at set times
with participating healthcare providers who have expertise in various specialized areas of medicine. Participating physicians can elect to allow
patients to request online appointments either via our real-time app or by setting, in their administrator dashboard panel, times and days of the
week that patients may request appointments. Appointment requests are then sent by our system to an email address specified by the physician’s
office, requesting a follow up to confirm or automatically accept the appointment request.
2

HealthLynked has developed an extensive directory featuring over 880,000 profiles of physicians and medical offices across the United
States, all of which are accessible for online search through the HealthLynked directory. This platform enables physicians and medical practices to
claim their profiles at no cost by joining the HealthLynked network via a BAA agreement with their practices, thus ensuring the accuracy of their
information and compliance of their staff.
There are two principal categories of practices and providers within the HealthLynked Network: in-network and out-of-network. To become
an in-network practice, a one-time setup fee of $450 is required. This fee covers the cost of a HealthLynked setup specialist who trains the practice
manager on accessing and configuring the practice’s and providers’ profiles connected to the medical facility. This status allows practices to
manage their profiles, including updating basic information, adding videos and images, and setting times for online appointment bookings and
secure medical record sharing within their practice. Additionally, in-network practices are preferred by patients for convenience, and even patients
from out-of-network are permitted to book online with in-network practices and providers. Practices incur a $30 booking fee for each new patient
booking obtained through the HealthLynked network.
Providers within in-network practices gain the ability to edit their profiles and enhance patient engagement by enabling online bookings and
sharing medical records, thereby increasing patient convenience and practice efficiency. The designation of in-network status is essential for
practices aiming to optimize their visibility and patient management processes within the HealthLynked ecosystem.
By participating in the HealthLynked Network, both in-network and out-of-network practices can utilize the platform to enhance patient care
and improve practice operations. Specifically, in-network practices benefit from advanced features and services designed to attract and retain
patients, streamline administrative tasks, and elevate the overall patient experience.
Patient data is stored in conformity with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology
for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the regulations promulgated under each by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of
Civil Rights (collectively, “HIPAA”). The network utilizes Amazon AWS infrastructure which uses Amazon HIPPA compliant servers along with
Amazon RDS with LAMP, HTML5 and several JavaScript frameworks, including Angular and React. Recommendations for end users are a 512
kbps+ internet connection speed and a web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or handheld devices such as
iOS devices, android phones or tablets. Our developers utilize third party controls for functionality and user interface where the use of those
controls adds value to the system beyond custom creation of new tools. We intend to adjust forward compatibility for major browser version
updates, new browsers, operating system updates or new operating system as needed. The HealthLynked Network is EMR agnostic, and is
compatible with all electronic medical records systems, allowing for minimal barriers to participation and broader penetration of the market.
The HealthLynked Network- How It Works
Our system walks patients through a series of easy-to-use pages with point and click selections and drop-down menus that allow them to
enter their past medical history, past surgical history, allergies, medications, and family medical history. In addition, members can create accounts
for children under the age of 18 and keep track of required visits and vaccines. Members select physicians, schools, hospitals and other parties to
whom they wish to grant access to their records. This access can be either ongoing, or restricted by time and date, in accordance with the patient’s
control settings.
Practices are required to have a claimed active account in order to access patients’ online records. Once a patient has granted the practice
access to their medical charts, office intake paperwork can be downloaded by the practice without the need for the patient to fill out lengthy and
repetitive paperwork. Upon completion of the office visit, practices are required to upload the patient’s medical record into the online patients’ file
within 24 hours via eFax, APIs with select EMRs (including AthenaNet) or through the HealthLynked Portal. Each patient’s account has a unique
bar code that when faxed into our system is recognized for that patient, and archived in the patient’s chart, by date and provider. The
HealthLynked Network is independent of any EMR system and physicians only require a fax machine or computer to participate, allowing for
minimal barriers to participation and broader penetration of the market.
In addition to serving as a complete medical record archive, we believe that the HealthLynked Network allows for shorter wait times at
doctors’ offices by giving doctors immediate access to patients’ complete medical information, insurance information and required treatment
consent forms. Patients only need to verify their treating physician’s access to their files upon or prior to their next doctor’s visit. Patients are also
able to coordinate multiple physician visits and keep an updated and complete personal medical record archive. These files may also be shared
among a patient’s different specialty physicians, a function that we believe is especially helpful for patients who travel and may need to access their
records or obtain physician referrals in multiple localities. We also believe that the HealthLynked Network is especially useful in medical
emergencies when patients are unable to provide a medical history on their own because our system allows patients the option to grant healthcare
providers, in advance, special access in emergency situations.
3

The HealthLynked Network also provides an online scheduling function for patients to book appointments with participating and non-
participating practices through the use of our Online Concierge staffed call center. The Online Concierge service allows participating healthcare
providers to offer specific times for available appointments. If a practice or provider has not yet claimed their listing in the HealthLynked Network
directory, HealthLynked’s concierge team facilitates the appointment request with that provider on behalf of the patient.

Applications, Product Releases, and Partnerships
In 2020, we released our COVID-19 tracker application for IOS mobile devices. We released our Android version on March 5, 2020. The
application allowed users to report how they are feeling and if they had any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. In addition, the
application included a detailed global map tracking the virus, the latest twitter feeds, and a real-time chat for users to engage with people from
around the world to share information. The application had millions of downloads in a ten-week period after launch and was the number one
tracking application in the Apple Medical Store for the month of March 2020. During 2022, we launched an update to the app to include confirmed
cases of the Omicron variant, as reported by the CDC and local state health departments. During 2023, we launched an additional mapping features
and improved interface.
In 2020, we launched Oohvie, a new iOS application focused on women’s healthcare. Oohvie offers unique features over competitive
menstrual tracking apps, including the ability to connect with a user’s healthcare providers and share menstrual cycle data. This important
information allows gynecologists to better evaluate patients for the causes of hormonal irregularities, infertility, pelvic pain, endometriosis and
many other medical conditions and provides data that could help identify gynecological problems such as fibroids, polyps, or cervical or uterine
cancer. Oohvie users also have access to a health forum designed specifically for women, covering topics such as contraception, menopause,
hormones, pregnancy, sexual health, and pelvic infections. Oohvie offers a real time chat feature where users can discuss their experiences with
birth control pills, menstrual symptoms, and other issues in private. In addition, users can purchase name brand feminine hygiene products that are
shipped directly to their home at significantly discounted prices. Users can also use the app to schedule reminders for taking birth control pills or
hormones. In 2022, we launched an update to the Oohvie app that allows users to chat with a live nurse to answer their medical questions and
order feminine products at low cost.
5

In 2021, we released CareLynk, an innovative AI-enabled healthcare directory allowing users to call one number and connect to any doctor
across the U.S. CareLynk utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and voice-to-text technology to understand what healthcare provider a caller
is looking for. The system includes doctors from over 88 different medical specialties. Providers can be located by last name, zip code and specialty.
Results are filtered in order of relevance allowing the user to quickly and efficiently locate the provider they are searching for, hands-free.
CareLynk was first released in Florida, connecting patients to over 33,000 doctors throughout the state. CareLynk, which is capable of connecting
to over 300,000 doctors across all 50 states, is expected to be expanded to include the rest of the United States in 2024.
During 2021, we launched DocLynk, a telemedicine service enabling users to connect to healthcare providers in the HealthLynked Network
from the convenience of their home by phone, web or mobile app.
During 2021, we released QwikCheck, a streamlined process for practices to institute remote patient check-in without the need for any
additional hardware. The QwikCheck system uses dynamic linking, which allows a single QR code tied to a practice that works seamlessly with both
Android and iOS platforms. Patients can check in for their doctor’s appointment using their mobile devices regardless of their smart phone’s
operating system, age, or model. QwikCheck allows patients to maintain social distance from the office staff and other patients while waiting for
their appointments. Patient intake information is provided to the practice via the application and eliminates front office exposure, time and
redundant paperwork. QwikCheck also provides all the back-end analytics for practices to manage their patient flow and optimize their provider’s
schedules.
In January 2023, we introduced significant enhancements to our Telehealth Service delivered through the HealthLynked app and web
portal. The upgraded Telehealth Service platform includes the unique ability for both patients and physicians to have immediate access to patient
records and allows for the downloading of medical images that could play a crucial role in the telehealth patient care experience. We also manage
all services associated with the Telehealth Service platform, including scheduling, documentation, and patient and physician communication.
HealthLynked Telehealth Service is available at a fixed fee of $60 per visit and is currently available in Florida.
In March 2023, we launched our Online Concierge service for physician appointment bookings. Patients can now book appointments with
any healthcare provider across the country through the HealthLynked Network’s online medical directory of over 880,000 healthcare providers and
practice locations. The new Online Concierge service allows participating healthcare providers to offer specific times for available appointments. If
a practice or provider has not yet claimed their listing in the HealthLynked Network directory, our concierge team will facilitate the appointment
request with that provider. Once patients have booked an appointment, they can download the HealthLynked app and update their medical
information in their secure HealthLynked profile. HealthLynked’s concierge staff is available to help patients update their health records for their
upcoming appointment if needed.
In June 2023, rolled out updates to our HealthLynked app, including Online Nurse Chat, Secure Direct Communication with Medical
Practices, Integrated Health Journal, Medical Record Uploading & Sharing, Mobile Check-In Process, and Copay Alerts and Payment.
In December 2023, we launched a search functionality update on our HealthLynked website and mobile applications, including a refined
provider search algorithm, a new geolocation-driven distance filter, new provider ratings, and improved filtering options.
Business Model
Our business model is focused on market penetration and recruiting physician practices and patients to use our system for archiving patient
medical records, comprehensive marketing to active and inactive patients, connecting on a regular basis utilizing news feeds and groups, accessing
new patients, and for on-line “real-time” scheduling physician appointments.
6

We charge physician practices a one-time activation fee of $450 to participate in the network. Participating practices upload their patient
files into a secure patient portal to market to their active and inactive patients. The practices initially send to all of their patients an email invitation
to claim their HLYK profiles free of charge, update their profiles and bring their profiles with them to their next visit to the physician’s office.
We also anticipate charging certain healthcare facilities either an annual or monthly fee that will vary per facility based upon number of
professionals per facility. Currently, it is anticipated that hospitals and emergency rooms would be charged a higher activation fee for our services
once our patient and physician network has been expanded.
The base services of the HealthLynked Network are free for patients. Access to the Online Concierge service, including personalized
appointment scheduling, 24-hour nurse hotline, and telehealth, was available for a free 30-day trial following its launch and thereafter paid member
plans start at $12/month per patient, or $20/month for a family plan.
We initially began deployment of the HealthLynked Network by registering NWC’s approximately 6,000 active patients and 6,500 inactive
patients. We then added patients from the healthcare providers serviced by CHM and AHP following our 2020 acquisition of CHM and AHP. While
we have generated minimal revenues from physician and patient fees related to such deployment through 2022, we believe that establishing the
patient database will be a valuable marketing tool for telesales, product sales and other marketing opportunities to physician practices and
patients. With the sale of AHP in January 2023, we plan on offering our online concierge service to the buyer’s patients and our practice tools to the
buyer’s ACO participating practices.
HealthLynked has launched other applications that provide valuable user patient services while also growing the number of patients in the
HealthLynked Network. We launched women’s health application Oohvie, with a new subscription plan as part of our Online Concierge service,
including new features. The original free launch had over 30,000 downloads free of charge.
During 2021, we updated our COVID-19 tracker application to include Omicron variant cases. The original tracker launched in March 2020
had millions of downloads in the first 45 days and was the number one tracking app in the Apple medical store. We also launched our automated
phone routing system, CareLynk, allowing patients to connect with any doctor in the United States via AI enabled speech recognition system, a new
telemedicine platform, DocLynk, and QwikCheck, a streamlined process for practices to institute remote patient check-in.
These applications and others are for the purpose of providing specific services to our patients and physician practices and to help grow the
number of users in the HealthLynked Network.
Sales Strategy
Starting in 2019, we deployed our PAH, providing free Wi-Fi to practice patients at no cost to our in-network physicians. Physician members
receive patient analytics from the PAH. In 2021 we developed software where we can offer the same services the PAH offered using direct QR code
technology, without the PAH hardware requirement. Our marketing efforts towards physicians emphasize how our systems can provide patient
analytics, increase practice revenues, improve office efficiencies, and improve the accuracy of recorded patients’ medical histories. Once a
physician becomes a HealthLynked Network member, they upload all their patient files in a secured portal in the cloud, email their patients to
claim their profiles, update them and bring their profiles in for their next office visit.
We also utilize internet-based search engine marketing and optimization (SEM/SEO) to increase our presence in certain targeted
geographical areas. These campaigns are focused on both physician practices and patients. We believe that direct-to-consumer marketing through
email campaigns is an effective way to build interest and drive patient and physician practice demand for our services. We anticipate that we will
be able to foster faster market penetration and increase demand for our services by marketing to both consumers and physician practices.
7

Our campaigns direct patients to look for physician practices in the HealthLynked Network to ensure that they maintain the accuracy and
completeness of their medical records. Our system further allows patients to search for “in-network” physician providers and schedule online “real-
time” appointments via our system. We believe that physician practices in the HealthLynked Network will see an increase in new patients as a
result of their participation and as more patients claim their profiles, from the use of the PAH, our new direct QR code software option, and our
digital marketing campaigns. The value to physician practices for joining our network will increase from not only existing patient marketing, but
also for acquisition of new patients registered in the HealthLynked Network.
Our new applications, Oohvie, COVID-19 tracker, CareLynk and DocLynk were all launched with the purpose of growing the HealthLynked
Network and generating incremental revenue for the business. These services are being marketed by our executive team to large health systems,
hospitals, universities and other potential clients and ACO partners.
We also believe that affiliated marketing campaigns will be very helpful in attracting new users and increasing market awareness. We
intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies, medical distributors, insurance companies, medical societies, large healthcare systems and
others to cross market our products.
Intellectual Property
On March 7, 2023, we were issued patent No. 11600395 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”). The patent,
entitled “Secure patient access via healthcare service provider specific wireless access point,” encompasses systems and methods for providing a
healthcare service provider-specific wireless access point, or “HUB”, that facilitates secure communication amongst patients, providers, and third-
party services. When in range of the HUB (e.g., in a doctor’s office waiting room), patient devices can connect to the healthcare service provider’s
wireless access point. The access point can be configured to detect the presence of a patient device, obtain identifying information, and send the
information to a server. The server uses the obtained information to create or update a profile for the patient associated with their device. This
profile can be updated with additional information derived from the patient’s interaction with the network, provider input, or the patient updating
their profile or inputting additional information. This innovative approach allows for streamlined communication and enhanced data security within
the healthcare setting.
In October 2023, we filed a patent application for our artificial intelligence (AI) program, ARI (Augmented Real-time Interface). ARI is a
healthcare companion designed to make healthcare more interactive, personalized, and user-friendly. By leveraging the capabilities of artificial
intelligence, ARI looks to blend technology and human touch, with the goal to provide timely and relevant healthcare advice.
We have registered “HealthLynked” and our corporate logo as a service mark with the USPTO.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts consist of building, developing, and enhancing the HealthLynked Network, including comprehensive
marketing to active and inactive patients, the real time scheduling of appointments through our new mobile application, regular appointment
scheduling, telemedicine appointment scheduling, sharing of secured documents between physicians and patients, and independent access via
mobile, tablet and web browser. Further, we are developing our systems to provide for secured data storage, drug interaction alerts, and the
barcoding of documents for retrieval and storage.
Professional and General Liability Coverage
We maintain directors’ and officers’, professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers generally on a claims-
made basis, subject to deductibles, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe
that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, no assurance can
be given that any pending or future claim against us will not be successful or if successful, will not exceed the limits of available insurance
coverage. Our business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. We contract and pay
premiums for professional liability insurance that indemnifies us and our affiliated healthcare professionals generally on a claims-made basis for
losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation. Professional liability coverage is required in order for our physicians to maintain hospital
privileges.

Employees
As of April 1, 2024, we had 38 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our
relationship with our employees to be excellent.
Competition
The markets for our Digital Healthcare products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology
and product standards, as well as frequent introduction of new products and services. Most of our competitors are more established, benefit from
greater name recognition, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Our principal existing
competitors include, but are not limited to, ZocDoc, Inc., AthenaHealth Inc., All-scripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Cerner Corporation, Epic
Systems Corporation, Teledoc Health Inc., Veritone Inc., Oscar Health, Good RX and Doximity. In addition, we expect that major software
information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers, start-up companies, managed care companies and
others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products and services. Amazon, Google, and Apple have also entered into the
digital healthcare space, including in the area of patient health records.
We believe that we differ from our competitors in that we are not a practice management software or an EMR provider. Companies like
AthenaHealth Inc., Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Cerner and Epic Systems Corporation offer software solutions to operate and manage a
medical practice. Functions of these systems include patient billing, monitoring patient account balances and payments, tracking of appointments
and creating encounter visits and a medical record for each patient seen. HealthLynked works in conjunction with these practice management
software systems and does not seek to replace them. Patients’ medical records created by these systems are uploaded to the patient’s profile in the
HealthLynked Network. The HealthLynked Network can incorporate any physical or digital documents into a patient’s medical record history and
thus allow it to be utilized across all healthcare platforms. HealthLynked provides an online appointment scheduling application that is similar to
ZocDoc, Inc.’s offering, but in addition offers telemedicine appointments through our own patient interface, and we do not charge practices for
cancelled appointments.
The advantage of having a healthcare network independent of any one practice management or EMR software allows the HealthLynked
system to be fully utilized across the entire medical community. Integration and participation by both patients and healthcare providers in a unified
platform offers significant advantages in the quality and nature of healthcare delivery in the future. To our knowledge a unified healthcare network
like HealthLynked currently does not exist in the market.
Competitors in our Patient Services division include women’s health, functional medicine, physical therapy practices and day spas
throughout southwest Florida.
Competitors in our Medical Distribution division indirectly include large unit-of-measure distributors such as McKesson Corp. and Medline
as well as small unit-of-measure distributor Henry Schein offering direct to physician, dental and veterinary practices. We attempt to differentiate
MOD’s model from these large distributors by focusing on small unit-of-measure distribution direct to patients and physician practices at
competitive pricing.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws, rules and regulations that are extensive and complex and for
which, in many cases, the industry has the benefit of only limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. If we are found to have violated these laws,
rules, or regulations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, healthcare
reform continues to attract significant legislative interest, regulatory activity, new approaches, legal challenges, and public attention that create
uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in
government policy or regulation may affect our reimbursement, restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business, or impose
additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.

Healthcare Reform
Health care laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and
Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the ACA, were enacted. The ACA includes a variety of health care reform
provisions and requirements, which became effective at varying times since its enactment and substantially changed the way health care is
financed by both governmental and private insurers.
In January 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal.” The order directed agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant
exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals,
health care providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In October 2017, President Trump issued a second
executive order relating to the ACA titled “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” which further directs federal
agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented, and soon after announced the termination of the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers
under the ACA. To date, Congressional efforts to completely repeal and replace the ACA have been unsuccessful. However, the individual mandate
for health insurance coverage under the ACA was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December
22, 2017.
Other proposed changes and reforms to the ACA have included, or may include the following: prohibiting the federal government from
operating health insurance marketplaces; eliminating the advanced premium tax credits, and cost sharing reductions for low income individuals
who purchase their health insurance through the marketplaces; expanding and encouraging the use of private health savings accounts; providing
for insurance plans that offer fewer and less extensive health insurance benefits than under the ACA’s essential health benefits package, including
broader use of catastrophic coverage plans, or short-term health insurance; establishing and funding high risk pools or reinsurance programs for
individuals with chronic or high cost conditions; and allowing insurers to sell insurance across state lines.
Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the timing of and potential for legal challenges, repeal
or amendment of that legislation and the future of the health insurance exchanges, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely
impact of the ACA on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Licensing and Certification
Our clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state, and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things,
professional credentialing and professional ethics. Penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards include loss of professional license,
civil or criminal fines and penalties, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. Our
clinical professionals are also subject to state and federal regulation regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Every physician
who administers, prescribes, or dispenses any controlled substance must be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”).
Additionally, our clinical personnel are required to meet applicable Medicaid and Medicare provider requirements, as set forth under state and
federal laws, rules, and regulations. Further, our facilities are also subject to federal, state, and local licensing regulations: we may have to obtain
regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of healthcare facilities, offering certain services, or expending
amounts in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part,
upon our ability and the ability of our clinicians and facilities to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, certifications, accreditations, and other
approvals.
Fraud and Abuse Provisions
Existing federal laws, as well as similar state laws, relating to government-sponsored or funded healthcare programs, or “GHC Programs,”
impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare companies like us. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by
multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) and various state agencies. In addition, in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress established a Medicaid Integrity Program
to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse and provide financial incentives for states to enact their own false
claims legislation as an additional enforcement tool against Medicaid fraud and abuse. Since then, a growing number of states have enacted or
expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
10

The fraud and abuse provisions include extensive federal and state laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, particularly on the services
offered through NWC. In particular, the federal anti-kickback statute has criminal provisions relating to the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of
any remuneration in return for either referring Medicaid, Medicare or other GHC Program business, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging
for or recommending any service or item for which payment may be made by GHC Programs. In addition, the federal physician self-referral law,
commonly known as the “Stark Law,” applies to physician ordering of certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare from an entity
with which the physician has a prohibited financial relationship. These laws are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by federal
courts, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation and prosecution, which can be costly and time
consuming. Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative remedies,
criminal sanctions (in the case of the anti-kickback statute), exclusion from participation in GHC Programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in
violation of such laws, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws authorizing the imposition of criminal, civil and
administrative penalties for filing false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement with government healthcare programs. These laws include the civil
False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits the submission of, or causing to be submitted, false claims to GHC Programs, including Medicaid,
Medicare, TRICARE (the program for military dependents and retirees), the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and insurance plans
purchased through ACA exchanges. Substantial civil fines and multiple damages, along with other remedies, can be imposed for violating the FCA.
Furthermore, proving a violation of the FCA requires only that the government show that the individual or company that submitted or caused to be
submitted an allegedly false claim acted in “reckless disregard” or in “deliberate ignorance” of the truth or falsity of the claim or with “willful
disregard,” notwithstanding that there may have been no specific intent to defraud the government program and no actual knowledge that the
claim was false (which typically are required to be shown to sustain a criminal conviction). The FCA also applies to the improper retention of known
overpayments and includes “whistleblower” provisions that permit private citizens to sue a claimant on behalf of the government and thereby share
in the amounts recovered under the law and to receive additional remedies. In recent years, many cases have been brought against healthcare
companies by such “whistleblowers,” which have resulted in judgments or, more often, settlements involving substantial payments to the
government by the companies involved. It is anticipated that the number of such actions against healthcare companies will continue to increase
with the enactment or enhancement of a growing number of state false claims acts, certain amendments to the FCA and enhanced government
enforcement.
Further, HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program under the joint direction of the Attorney General and
the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Inspector General, designed to coordinate federal,
state, and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and abuse. Under HIPAA, a healthcare benefit program includes any
private plan or contract affecting interstate commerce under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided. A person or entity that
knowingly and willfully obtains the money or property of any healthcare benefit program by means of false or fraudulent representations in
connection with the delivery of healthcare services is subject to a fine or imprisonment, or both. In addition, HIPAA authorizes the imposition of
civil money penalties against entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded Medicare or Medicaid program participants if such entities
provide services to federal health program beneficiaries.
In addition, federal and state agencies that administer healthcare programs have at their disposal statutes, commonly known as “civil money
penalty laws,” that authorize substantial administrative fines and exclusion from government programs in cases where an individual or company
that filed a false claim, or caused a false claim to be filed, knew or should have known that the claim was false or fraudulent. As under the FCA, it
often is not necessary for the agency to show that the claimant had actual knowledge that the claim was false or fraudulent in order to impose
these penalties.
The civil and administrative false claims statutes are being applied in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. For example,
government authorities have asserted that claiming reimbursement for services that fail to meet applicable quality standards may, under certain
circumstances, violate these statutes. Government authorities also often take the position, now with support in the FCA, that claims for services
that were induced by kickbacks, Stark Law violations or other illicit marketing schemes are fraudulent and, therefore, violate the false claims
statutes. Many of the laws and regulations referenced above can be used in conjunction with each other.
11

If we were excluded from participation in any government-sponsored healthcare programs, not only would we be prohibited from submitting
claims for reimbursement under such programs, but we also would be unable to contract with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to
provide services to them. It could also adversely affect our ability to contract with, or to obtain payment from, non-governmental payors.
Although we intend to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of the laws,
rules and regulations applicable to us, including those relating to billing and those relating to financial relationships with physicians and hospitals,
are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to
violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. Moreover, the standards of business conduct expected of healthcare companies under these laws and
regulations have become more stringent in recent years, even in instances where there has been no change in statutory or regulatory language. If
there is a determination by government authorities that we have not complied with any of these laws, rules and regulations, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.
False or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding
Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-
regulatory guidance. We provide billing and coding services, claims processing and other solutions to providers that relate to, or directly involve,
the reimbursement of health services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal and state healthcare programs and private payers. These
services may subject us to, or we may be contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent
claims including but not limited to the FCA, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”), and state equivalents. We rely on our customers
to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so.
The FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly to include not only actual knowledge of a claim’s falsity, but also reckless disregard of the
truth of the information, or deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The FCA may be
enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may use the
FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors and billing for services not rendered. Further,
submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. When
an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus
substantial civil penalties for each false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. We rely on our customers to
provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so.
Government Reimbursement Requirements
In order to participate in the various state Medicaid programs and in the Medicare program, we must comply with stringent and often
complex enrollment and reimbursement requirements. Moreover, different states impose differing standards for their Medicaid programs. While we
believe that we adhere to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the government programs in which we participate, any failure to comply with
these laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, GHC Programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations,
requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program
payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to providers. Moreover, because these programs generally
provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue by increasing
the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs,
and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift
to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will
continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for various services. Our business may be
significantly and adversely affected by any such changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare
costs associated with Medicaid, Medicare and other government healthcare programs.
Our business also could be adversely affected by reductions in, or limitations of, reimbursement amounts or rates under these government
programs, reductions in funding of these programs or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs.
12

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
Numerous federal and state laws, rules, and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, and confidentiality of protected health
information, including HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, violations of which are punishable by monetary fines, civil penalties and, in some
cases, criminal sanctions. As part of the HealthLynked Network and our medical record keeping, third-party billing and other services, we collect
and maintain protected health information on the patients that we serve.
Pursuant to HIPAA, the HHS has adopted standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known
as the Privacy Standards and Security Standards. HHS’ Privacy Standards apply to medical records and other individually identifiable health
information in any form, whether electronic, paper or oral, that is used or disclosed by healthcare providers, hospitals, health plans and healthcare
clearinghouses, which are known as “covered entities.” HHS’ Security Standards require healthcare providers to implement administrative,
physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of individually identifiable health information that is
electronically received, maintained or transmitted (including between us and our affiliated practices). To the extent permitted by applicable privacy
regulations and contracts and associated Business Associate Agreements with our customers, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health
information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require
written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations In addition, with respect to our managed
physician practices, the HIPAA administrative simplification provisions require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards of
healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. Further, the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) strengthened and expanded HIPAA, increased penalties for violations, gave patients new rights to restrict
uses and disclosures of their health information, and imposed a number of privacy and security requirements directly on business associates that
perform functions or services on behalf of covered entities. Specifically, HITECH requires that covered entities report any unauthorized use or
disclosure of protected health information that meets the definition of a “breach” to the affected individuals. In addition, HITECH requires that
business associates report breaches to their covered entity customers. HITECH also authorizes state Attorneys General to bring civil actions in
response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. Final regulations implementing the HITECH requirements were issued
in January 2013.
To the extent we are permitted under our customer contracts, we may de-identify protected health information and use de-identified
information for our purposes without obtaining patient authorization or further complying with HIPAA. Determining whether protected health
information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex
factual and statistical analyses. Any failure by us to meet HIPAA requirements with respect to de-identification could subject us to penalties.
In addition to the federal HIPAA and HITECH requirements, numerous other state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality
of patient information, including state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection laws, state genetic privacy laws, human
subjects research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and
confidentiality of patient information. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal
rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and are
also subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities.
13

Data Protection and Breaches
Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards, and all states have laws that require certain actions in response
to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state’s attorney general. In some states, these
laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. The laws are inconsistent
across states, which can increase the costs of compliance. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on Business Associates. In
certain circumstances involving large breaches, media notice is required. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is
presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Business Associate or covered entity establishes that there is a low probability the information
has been compromised consistent with the risk assessment requirements enumerated in HIPAA. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission uses its
consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches.
Compliance Programs
Organizations that receive reimbursement from a federal or state government payor are expected by the federal government to have a
compliance program. Specifically, compliance programs are integral to identifying and rectifying fraud and abuse risk areas, billing and coding
violations, and educating employees about the law and other legal requirements or restrictions within the scope of their practice. We maintain a
program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare entities. We believe that our compliance
program meets the relevant standards provided by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Environmental Regulations
Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws,
rules and regulations. Our office-based operations are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Such
compliance does not, and we anticipate that such compliance will not, materially affect our capital expenditures, financial position or results of
operations.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable state
laws. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer
debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring
compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Florida’s Consumer Collection Practices Act is broader than the
federal legislation, applying the regulations to “creditors” as well as “collectors,” whereas the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is applicable only
to collectors. This prohibits creditors who are attempting to collect their own debts from engaging in behavior prohibited by the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act and Consumer Collection Practices Act. The Consumer Collection Practices Act has very specific guidelines regarding
which actions debt collectors and creditors may engage in to collect unpaid debt.
Government Investigations
We expect that audits, inquiries and investigations from government authorities, agencies, contractors and payors will occur in the ordinary
course of business. Such audits, inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.
14

Item 1A. Risk Factors
FINANCIAL AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS
We believe our current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our business for the next twelve months from the date
these financial statements are issued, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2023, we had cash balances of $247,222, a working capital deficit of $1,755,864 and an accumulated deficit of
$42,033,136. Based on our current business plan, management believes that our available cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund
its operations for the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
10-K without generating positive cash flows and by raising additional capital from outside sources. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our current operating plan is based on current assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and
we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be forced to delay or reduce the scope of its
commercialization or development programs and/or limit or cease our operations if we are unable to obtain additional funding to support its
current business plan.
A failure to obtain financing could prevent us from executing our business plan or operate as a going concern
We anticipate that current cash resources and opportunities will be insufficient for us to execute our business plan for twelve months after
the date these financial statements are issued. It is possible that if future financing is not obtained, we will not be able to operate as a going
concern. We believe that securing substantial additional sources of financing is possible, but there is no assurance of our ability to secure such
financing. A failure to obtain additional financing could prevent us from making necessary expenditures for advancement and growth to partner
with businesses and hire additional personnel. If we raise additional financing by selling equity, or convertible debt securities, the relative equity
ownership of our existing investors could be diluted, or the new investors could obtain terms more favorable than previous investors. If we raise
additional funds through debt financing, we could incur significant borrowing costs and be subject to adverse consequences in the event of a
default.
Without raising additional capital, whether via additional advances made pursuant to the July 5, 2022 Standby Equity Purchase Agreement
(the “SEPA”), from the sale of equity or debt instruments, from the collection of remaining contingent consideration related to the sale of AHP, or
from other sources, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Any equity capital raised may result in substantial
dilution in the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock.
We may never be able to implement our proposed online personal medical information and archiving system and as such, an
investment in us at this stage of our business is extremely risky.
The HealthLynked Network was soft launched in 2018. The success of the HealthLynked Network depends in large part on the population of
the network with physicians and patients. We continually develop additional functionality of the Network. However, we cannot predict the scale of
how many physicians and patients will adopt our technology, or if and when they do, the timing of such large-scale adoption. Further, it is possible
that other competitors with greater resources could enter the market and make it more difficult for us to attract or keep customers. Consequently,
at this phase of our development, our future is speculative and depends on the proper execution of our business model, including but not limited to
deploying the PAH, populating the HealthLynked Network with a substantial number of patients, registering paying physicians in the HealthLynked
Network, and continuing to develop additional applications and functionality for the HealthLynked Network.
Our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan by fully developing our online medical records platform and
recruiting physicians and patients to adopt and use the system. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully
implement our business plan.
Our operations to date have been limited to providing patient services at our NWC, NCFM and BTG facilities, generating MSSP and
consulting revenue from our now discontinued ACO/MSO segment, and generating product revenue from our Medical Distribution segment. We
have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully develop or market the online medical records platform we seek to provide through the
HealthLynked Network. We have not entered into any agreements with third party doctors or patients to use our system for their medical records
and there is no assurance that we will be able to enter into such agreements in the future.
Failure to remediate a material weakness in internal accounting controls could result in material misstatements in our financial
statements.
Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that, due to such
material weakness, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023. If not remediated, our failure to establish
and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in
our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.
15

We may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth.
Our strategy envisions a period of potentially rapid growth in our physician network over the next five years based on aggressively
increasing our marketing efforts. We currently maintain a small in-house programming, IT, administrative, marketing and sales function. The
capacity to service the online medical records platform and our expected growth, including growth via acquisition, may impose a significant burden
on our future planned administrative and operational resources. The growth of our business may require significant investments of capital and
increased demands on our management, workforce and facilities. We will be required to substantially expand our administrative and operational
resources and attract, train, manage and retain qualified employees, management and other personnel. Failure to do so, or to satisfy such
increased demands would interrupt or have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The departure or loss of Dr. Michael Dent could disrupt our business.
During 2022 and 2023, we depended heavily on the continued efforts of Dr. Michael Dent, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board. Dr. Dent is essential to our strategic vision and day-to-day operations and would be difficult to replace. While we have entered into a written
employment contract with Dr. Dent, we cannot be certain that Dr. Dent will continue with us for any particular period of time. The departure or loss
of Dr. Dent, or the inability to hire and retain a qualified replacement, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.
Our sales strategy may not be successful.
Since 2018, we have used a telesales model in lieu of a direct sales force, in large part to reduce our costs. There is no assurance that our
telesales model will be effective, and this could have a negative effect on the HealthLynked and MOD businesses and their growth.
Key components of our product sales made through MOD are provided by a sole supplier, and supply shortages or loss of this supplier
could result in interruptions in supply or increased costs.
We rely on a sole supplier for the fulfillment of nearly all product sales made through MOD. If this sole supplier is unable to supply to us in
the quantities we require, or at all, or otherwise defaults on its supply obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain alternative supplies form
other suppliers on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. In the event the sole supplier breaches its contract with us, our legal remedies
associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages we may suffer.
The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable
laws, rules, or regulations.
The healthcare industry, healthcare information technology, the online medical records platform services that we provide, and the
physicians’ medical practices we engage in through our Health Services segment are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local
laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which imposes substantial costs on us. Of particular importance are the provisions summarized as
follows:
● federal laws (including the Federal False Claims Act) that prohibit entities and individuals from knowingly or recklessly making claims to
Medicaid, Medicare and other government-funded programs that contain false or fraudulent information or from improperly retaining
known overpayments;
● a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the “anti-kickback” statute, that prohibits the knowing and willful offer,
payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral or
recommendation of patients for items and services covered, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and
Medicare;
16

● a provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, applies when
physicians refer Medicare patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of
such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including a compensation arrangement) with the entity;
● similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, fee splitting, self-referral and false claims issues, which typically are not limited
to relationships involving government-funded programs;
● provisions of the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) that prohibit knowingly
and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material

items or services;
● state laws that prohibit general business corporations from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in

● federal and state healthcare programs may deny our application to become a participating provider that could in turn cause us to not be
able to treat those patients or prohibit us from billing for the treatment services provided to such patients;
● federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicaid or Medicare for services unless the
services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level
of services rendered;
● federal and state laws pertaining to the provision of services by non-physician practitioners, such as advanced nurse practitioners,
physician assistants and other clinical professionals, physician supervision of such services and reimbursement requirements that may
be dependent on the manner in which the services are provided and documented; and
● federal laws that impose civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded
healthcare programs, inappropriately reducing hospital care lengths of stay for such patients, or employing individuals who are excluded
from participation in federally funded healthcare programs.
In addition, we believe that our business, including the business conducted through our Health Services segment, will continue to be subject
to increasing regulation, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict.
We may in the future become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings, and our interpretations of applicable laws,
rules and regulations may be challenged. For example, regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that our arrangements with physicians
using the HealthLynked Network constitute fee splitting and seek to invalidate these arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. Regulatory authorities or other
parties also could assert that our relationships violate the anti-kickback, fee splitting or self-referral laws and regulations. Such investigations,
proceedings and challenges could result in substantial defense costs to us and a diversion of management’s time and attention. In addition,
violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government-sponsored
healthcare programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.
Furthermore, changes in these laws and regulations, or administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, may require us to change our
business practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the complex
and far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in
compliance with these laws.
We rely on Amazon Web Services, or AWS, for the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. Any
disruption of or interference with our use of the platform would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business.
Amazon provides distributed computing infrastructure platforms for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud”
computing service. We currently run the vast majority of our computing on AWS, have built our software and computer systems to use computing,
storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services AWS, and our systems are not fully redundant on the platform. Any transition of the cloud
services currently provided by AWS to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and would cause us to incur significant time and
expense. Given this, any significant disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would negatively impact our operations and our business
would be seriously harmed. If our users or partners are not able to access the HealthLynked Network or specific HealthLynked features, or
encounter difficulties in doing so, due to issues or disruptions with AWS, we may lose users, partners, or revenue. The level of service provided by
AWS or similar providers may also impact our users’ and partners’ usage of and satisfaction with our web-based product offerings and could
seriously harm our business and reputation. If AWS or similar providers experience interruptions in service regularly or for a prolonged basis, or
other similar issues, our business would be seriously harmed. Hosting costs also have and will continue to increase as our user base and user
engagement grows and may seriously harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of AWS
or similar providers.
17

Federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of protected health information may increase our costs and limit our
ability to collect and use that information and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of individually
identifiable health information. These laws include:
● Provisions of HIPAA that limit how healthcare providers may use and disclose individually identifiable health information, provide
certain rights to individuals with respect to that information and impose certain security requirements;
● The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which strengthens and expands the HIPAA
Privacy Standards and Security Standards and imposes data breach notification obligations;
● Other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, many of which
are not preempted by HIPAA;
● Federal and state consumer protection laws; and
● Federal and state laws regulating the conduct of research with human subjects.
Through the HealthLynked Network, we collect and maintain protected health information in paper and electronic format. New protected
health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, HITECH, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect
on the manner in which we handle healthcare-related data and communicate with third parties, and compliance with these standards could impose
significant costs on us, or limit our ability to offer certain services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us.
In addition, if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protected health information, we could be subject to
remedies that include monetary fines, civil or administrative penalties, civil damage awards or criminal sanctions.
RISKS RELATED TO THE HEALTHLYNKED NETWORK
The market for Internet-based personal medical information and record archiving systems may not develop substantially further or
develop more slowly than we expect, harming the growth of our business.
It is uncertain whether personal medical information and record archiving systems will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and
market acceptance we anticipate. Further, even though we expect patients and physicians within our own Health Services segment to use the
HealthLynked Network, our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the willingness of unaffiliated patients, physicians and hospitals to use
our services. Some patients, physicians and hospitals may be reluctant or unwilling to use our services, because they may have concerns regarding
the risks associated with the security and reliability, among other things, of the technology model associated with these services. If our target users
do not believe our systems are secure and reliable, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect,
either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
If we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to our target users, we may not remain competitive, and our
revenues and operating results could suffer.
Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements,
and obtain market acceptance. Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to
our clients and users. As a result, we will be required to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing
services and introduce new high-quality services that clients and users will want, while offering these services at competitive prices.
If we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely or cost-effective
basis, we may lose clients and target users. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients
and users, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our
competitors may be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services.
This may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.
18

We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing, our intellectual property and other
proprietary rights.
Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We expect to rely upon a
combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and unfair competition laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual
provisions, to protect these rights.
Our attempts to protect our intellectual property through copyright, patent, and trademark registration may be challenged by others or
invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have submitted the application for our first two provisional patents for our PAH
and intend to submit other patent applications covering our integrated technology, the scope of issued patents, if any, may be insufficient to
prevent competitors from providing products and services similar to ours, our patents may be successfully challenged, and we may not be able to
obtain additional meaningful patent protection in the future. There can be no assurance that our patent registration efforts will be successful.
Our expected agreements with clients, users, vendors and strategic partners will limit their use of, and allow us to retain our rights in, our
intellectual property and proprietary information. Further, we anticipate that these agreements will grant us ownership of intellectual property
created in the performance of those agreements to the extent that it relates to the provision of our services. In addition, we require certain of our
employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and assignment of inventions agreements. We also require certain of our
vendors and strategic partners to agree to contract provisions regarding confidentiality and non-competition. However, no assurance can be given
that these agreements will not be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Further, no assurance can be given that
these agreements will be effective in preventing the unauthorized access to, or use of, our proprietary information or the reverse engineering of our
technology. Agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any
particular case. In any event, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technology or authoring clinical
information that is substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or the information we distribute.
To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our
proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially
harm our business. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. In addition, if we resort to legal
proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights
of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition.
In addition, our platforms incorporate “open source” software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses.
While we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use, open
source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of
these licenses. Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. For example, some open source licenses
require that those using the associated code disclose modifications made to that code and such modifications be licensed to third parties at no cost.
We monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our
proprietary source code. However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur.
We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.
The software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by
frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may receive in the future
communications from third parties claiming that we, our technology, or components thereof, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.
We may not be able to withstand such third-party claims against our technology, and we could lose the right to use third-party technologies that are
the subject of such claims. Any intellectual property claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve,
divert management attention from executing our business plan, and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing
agreements. Although we intend that many of our third-party service providers will be obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights
of others, such indemnification may not be effective or adequate to protect us or the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual
obligations.
19

Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a
license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology
or information. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, from third parties
asserting an infringement claim; that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all; that we would be able to obtain
a license to use a suitable alternative technology or information to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, our affected
services; or that we would not need to change our product and design plans, which could require us to redesign affected products or services or
delay new offerings. Accordingly, an adverse determination could prevent us from implementing our strategy or offering our services and products,
as currently contemplated.
We may not be able to properly safeguard the information on the HealthLynked Network.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of new technologies and the increased activities of perpetrators
of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business or financial information. A failure in, or a breach of our information systems as a
result of cyber-attacks could disrupt our business, result in the release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation,
and increase our administrative expenses. Further, any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under U.S. federal and state laws and
could adversely impact our business. Although we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats
continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate
and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our employees may not take all appropriate measures to secure and protect confidential information in their possession.
Each of our employees is advised that they are responsible for the security of the information in our systems and to ensure that private
information is kept confidential. Should an employee not follow appropriate security measures, including those that have been put in place to
prevent cyber threats or attacks, the improper release of protected health information could result. The release of such information could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
RISKS RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES
Any state budgetary constraints could have an adverse effect on our reimbursement from Medicaid programs.
As a result of slow economic growth and volatile economic conditions, many states are continuing to collect less revenue than they did in
prior years and as a consequence are facing budget shortfalls and underfunded pension and other obligations. Although the shortfalls for the more
recent budgetary years have declined, they are still significant by historical standards. The financial condition in Florida or other states in which we
may operate in the future could lead to reduced or delayed funding for Medicaid programs and, in turn, reduced or delayed reimbursement for
physician services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Healthcare reform may have a significant effect on our business.
The ACA contains a number of provisions that could affect us over the next several years. These provisions include the establishment of
health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans, and expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Further, under
the ACA, payment modifiers are being developed that will differentiate payments to physicians under federal healthcare programs based on quality
and cost of care. In addition, other provisions authorize voluntary demonstration projects relating to the bundling of payments for episodes of
hospital care and the sharing of cost savings achieved under the Medicare program.
The ACA also allows states to expand their Medicaid programs through an increase in the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a state’s
current eligibility levels to 133% of the federal poverty level. It remains unclear to what extent states will expand their Medicaid programs by
raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level.
The ACA also remains subject to continuing legislative scrutiny, including efforts by Congress to further amend or repeal a number of its
provisions as well as administrative actions delaying the effectiveness of key provisions. As a result, we cannot predict with any assurance the
ultimate effect of the ACA on our Company, nor can we provide any assurance that its provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
20

Government-funded programs or private insurers may limit, reduce or make retroactive adjustments to reimbursement amounts or
rates.
A portion of the net patient service revenue derived from services rendered through our Health Services segment is from payments made by
Medicare and Medicaid and other government-sponsored or funded healthcare programs (the “GHC Programs”). These government-funded
programs, as well as private insurers, have taken and may continue to take steps, including a movement toward increased use of managed care
organizations, value-based purchasing, and new patient care models to control the cost, eligibility for, use and delivery of healthcare services as a
result of budgetary constraints and cost containment pressures due to unfavorable economic conditions, rising healthcare costs and for other
reasons. These government-funded programs and private insurers may attempt other measures to control costs, including bundling of services and
denial of, or reduction in, reimbursement for certain services and treatments. As a result, payments from government programs or private payors
may decrease significantly. Also, any adjustment in Medicare reimbursement rates may have a detrimental impact on our reimbursement rates not
only for Medicare patients, but also because Medicaid and other third-party payors often base their reimbursement rates on a percentage of
Medicare rates. Our business may also be materially affected by limitations on, or reductions in, reimbursement amounts or rates or elimination of
coverage for certain individuals or treatments. Moreover, because government-funded programs generally provide for reimbursements on a fee-
schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount we
charge for services rendered by our physicians. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these
programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-government-funded insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to
recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In addition, funds we receive from third-party payors are subject to audit with
respect to the proper billing for physician and ancillary services and, accordingly, our revenue from these programs may be adjusted retroactively.
Any retroactive adjustments to our reimbursement amounts could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and the trading price of our common stock.
We may become subject to billing investigations by federal and state government authorities.
Federal and state laws, rules and regulations impose substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, exclusion from participation in
government healthcare programs and imprisonment, on entities or individuals (including any individual corporate officers or physicians deemed
responsible) that fraudulently or wrongfully bill government-funded programs or other third-party payors for healthcare services. CMS issued a
final rule requiring states to implement a Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program effective January 1, 2012. States are required to
contract with one or more eligible Medicaid RACs to review Medicaid claims for any overpayments or underpayments, and to recoup overpayments
from providers on behalf of the state. In addition, federal laws, along with a growing number of state laws, allow a private person to bring a civil
action in the name of the government for false billing violations. We believe that audits, inquiries and investigations from government agencies will
occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our operations, which could result in substantial defense costs to us and a diversion of
management’s time and attention. We cannot predict whether any future audits, inquiries or investigations, or the public disclosure of such
matters, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our
common stock.
We may not appropriately record or document the services provided by our physicians.
We must appropriately record and document the services our doctors provide to seek reimbursement for their services from third-party
payors. If our physicians do not appropriately document, or where applicable, code for their services, we could be subjected to administrative,
regulatory, civil, or criminal investigations or sanctions and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
adversely affected.
We may not be able to successfully recruit and retain qualified physicians, who are key to our Health Services segment’s revenues
and billing.
We have experienced substantial turnover of physicians at our Health Service Division facilities. Our ability to operate profitably will
depend, in part, upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified physicians, who are key to our Health Services segment’s revenues and billing. We
compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and health systems and other
practice groups, for the services of qualified doctors, nurses, physical therapists and other skilled healthcare providers essential to our Health
Services segment. We may not be able to continue to recruit new, qualified providers or renew contracts with existing providers on acceptable
terms. If we do not do so, our ability to service execute our business plan may be adversely affected.
21

A significant number of physicians could leave our practices and we may be unable to enforce the non-competition covenants of
departed employees.
We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our physicians that can be terminated without cause by any party upon prior
written notice. In addition, substantially all of our physicians have agreed not to compete with us within a specified geographic area for a certain
period after termination of employment. The law governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to
state. Although we believe that the non-competition and other restrictive covenants applicable to our affiliated physicians are reasonable in scope
and duration and therefore enforceable under applicable state law, courts and arbitrators in some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-
compete agreements and restrictive covenants against physicians. Our physicians may leave our practices for a variety of reasons, including
providing services for other types of healthcare providers, such as teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and health systems
and other practice groups. If a substantial number of our physicians leave our practices or we are unable to enforce the non-competition covenants
in the employment agreements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially, and adversely affected.
We cannot predict whether a court or arbitration panel would enforce these covenants in any particular case.
We may be subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits not covered by insurance.
Our business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. We may also be subject to
other lawsuits which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended
to cover professional liability and other claims, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising
out of claims asserted against us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common
stock. See “Professional and General Liability Coverage.”
We may not be able to collect reimbursements for our services from third-party payors in a timely manner.
Approximately 8% of our net patient service revenue is derived from reimbursements from various third-party payors, including GHC
Programs, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for services provided by our physicians. We are responsible for submitting
reimbursement requests to these payors and collecting the reimbursements, and we assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed
reimbursements. In the current healthcare environment, payors continue their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare, including revisions to
coverage and reimbursement policies. Due to the nature of our business and our participation in government-funded and private reimbursement
programs, we are involved from time to time in inquiries, reviews, audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our
business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. We may be required to repay
these agencies or private payors if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed, or we may be subjected to pre-payment reviews, which
can be time-consuming and result in non-payment or delayed payment for the services we provide. We may also experience difficulties in collecting
reimbursements because third-party payors may seek to reduce or delay reimbursements to which we are entitled for services that our affiliated
physicians have provided. In addition, GHC Programs may deny our application to become a participating provider that could prevent us from
providing services to patients or prohibit us from billing for such services. If we are not reimbursed fully and in a timely manner for such services
or there is a finding that we were incorrectly reimbursed, our revenue, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Certain federal and state laws may limit our effectiveness at collecting monies owed to us from patients.
We utilize third parties to collect from patients any co-payments and other payments for services that are provided by our physicians. The
Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act restricts the methods that third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from
consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. State laws vary with respect to debt collection practices, although most state requirements are
similar to those under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, is broader than the federal legislation,
applying the regulations to “creditors” as well as “collectors,” whereas the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is applicable only to collectors. This
prohibits creditors who are attempting to collect their own debts from engaging in behavior prohibited by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
and Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act. The Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act has very specific guidelines regarding which actions
debt collectors and creditors may engage in to collect unpaid debt. If our collection practices or those of our collection agencies are inconsistent
with these standards, we may be subject to actual damages and penalties. These factors and events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.
22

We may not be able to maintain effective and efficient information systems.
The profitability of our business is dependent on uninterrupted performance of our information systems. Failure to maintain reliable
information systems, disruptions in our existing information systems or the implementation of new systems could cause disruptions in our business
operations, including errors and delays in billings and collections, disputes with patients and payors, violations of patient privacy and
confidentiality requirements and other regulatory requirements, increased administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR ORGANIZATION
Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board to create a new series of preferred stock without further approval by our
stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.
Our Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board also has the authority to
issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that
would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to
the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.
In addition, our Board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is
convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing
stockholders.
Stockholders’ ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because Michael Dent, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the Board, currently owns a controlling percentage of the voting power of our common stock.
Currently, our officer and directors as a group beneficially control approximately 70.0% of our voting power, of which approximately 68.4%
is controlled by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Michael Dent. As a result of this voting control, our officer and directors can control all matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other
stockholders may desire. In addition, as the interests of our officer and directors and our minority stockholders may not always be the same, this
large concentration of voting power may lead to stockholder votes that are inconsistent with the best interests of our minority stockholders or the
best interest of the Company as a whole.
If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results
accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation
and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.
Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial
reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our
business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical
undiscovered failures of internal controls exist and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.
We are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require our
management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not yet required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and will not be required to do so for as long as we are a “non-
accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
23

The public market for our common stock is limited. Failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively affect its value
and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.
Our common stock has traded on the OTCQB under the symbol “HLYK” since May 10, 2017. There is a limited public market for our
common stock and a more active public market for our common stock may not develop. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market
could make it difficult to sell shares or recover any part of an investment in our common shares. Even if a market for our common stock does
develop, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating to future operating performance
and the profitability of operations, factors such as variations in interim financial results or various, as yet unpredictable, factors, many of which are
beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.
Our common stock is subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes
transactions in our common stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock.
Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that
has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any
transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in
penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity
of the penny stock to be purchased.
In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information,
investment experience, and investment objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are
suitable for that person and that the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of
transactions in penny stocks.
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the
penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b)
confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less
willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our
common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the
commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and
remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price
information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
We are a “smaller reporting company”, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller
reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are able to take
advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
periodic reports and proxy statements and providing only two years of audited financial statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our
common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there
may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
24

Our stockholders are subject to significant dilution upon the occurrence of certain events which could result in a decrease in our
stock price.
As of April 1, 2024, we had approximately 88,364,663 shares of our common stock reserved or designated for future issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding options, warrants, unvested employee grants, common stock issuable, and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Future
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public and the issuance of the shares reserved for future issuance, in payment of our
debt, and/or upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants, will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and could result in a decrease in our
stock price.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
We rely on information systems and the data stored on them to conduct its operations. We have adopted and maintain a cybersecurity risk
management program in accordance with our risk profile and business that is informed by and incorporates elements of industry standards.
Our cybersecurity risk management program incorporates multiple components, including, but not limited to, ongoing monitoring of critical
risks from cybersecurity threats using automated tools. Additionally, we have implemented an employee education and training program, which we
provide on an annual basis, that is designed to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. To support our cybersecurity risk management program,
we leverage managed service providers and other third-party information technology and cybersecurity providers and consultants, including to
perform regular system scans and threat intelligence analysis. Additionally, we require certain third-party providers and consultants to adhere to
contractual requirements relating to privacy and cybersecurity standards.
We have not identified any cybersecurity incidents or threats that have materially affected us or are reasonably likely to materially affect us,
including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, like other companies in our industry, we and our third-party
vendors have from time-to-time experienced threats and security incidents that could affect our information or systems. For more information,
please see the section entitled “Risk Factors.”

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. We are not aware of any such legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or operating results.

Revenue
Patient service revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $76,862, or 1% year-over-year, from $5,407,416, to $5,484,278,
primarily as a result of a 5% year-over-year increase at our NCFM practice of $158,803, a 21% year-over-year increase at our BTG practice of
$49,315, and the addition of AEU revenue of $67,187 following its acquisition in May 2022. The increases were offset by a 30% decrease of
$198,443 at NWC.
Subscription and event revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $38,066, or 183% year-over-year, to $58,901, from
$20,835, due to an increase in HealthLynked Network paid subscriptions.
Product revenue was $179,200 in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $429,951 in the year ended December 31, 2022, a
decrease of $250,751, or 58%. Product revenue was earned by the Medical Distribution Division, comprised of the operations of MOD. During the
fourth quarter of 2022, we restructured our pricing in MOD to more accurately recapture the price of products sold with more consistent profit.
The price increases led in part to the decline in revenue.
Operating Expenses and Costs
Practice salaries and benefits decreased by $104,578, or 3%, to $3,231,117 in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3,335,695
in the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of cost reduction efforts at NWC and BTG, offset by increased production pay and personnel costs
corresponding to increased revenue and the addition of AEU salaries and benefits in 2023 with only a partial period of corresponding cost in 2022.
Other practice operating costs decreased by $361,106 or 14%, to $2,205,085 in the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2,566,191 in the
year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of focused cost reduction efforts at all of our practices in 2023.
Cost of product revenue was $142,501 in the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $320,655, or 69%, compared to $463,156 in the
same period of 2022, corresponding to the decline in product sales for the period compared to the same period in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $954,088, or 21%, to $3,623,402 in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to
$4,577,490 in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower personnel, legal and consulting, and other overhead costs in our corporate
function resulting from focused cost cutting efforts.
Depreciation and amortization decreased in the year ended December 31, 2023 by $477,454, or 58%, to $352,027 compared to $829,481 in
the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the full impairment of MOD depreciable intangible assets in fourth quarter 2022,
eliminating approximately $177,000 in quarterly depreciation in 2023 and after. This decrease was offset by depreciation on NCFM intangible
assets that were previously treated as indefinite lived and for which depreciation was initiated in 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required impairment assessments of
goodwill related to our AEU business. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, and (ii) an
inability of the business to achieve profitability since its acquisition. We determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, which consists
of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $319,958 to adjust
carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of $-0- in the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we determined that triggering events had occurred that required impairment assessments of the MOD Website. The triggering events included (i) a
material decline in revenue during 2022, and during fourth quarter 2022 in particular, from the reporting unit’s existing customer base, (ii) delays
in realization of material increases in revenue from new marketing channels, and (iii) an inability to achieve profitability during 2022 despite a
fundamental pricing and profit margin restructuring implemented in fourth quarter of 2022. We determined that the asset group, which included
the MOD Website and goodwill related to MOD, was not recoverable and, accordingly, recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $2,745,563
to adjust carrying value to its estimated fair value of $-0-. The impairment charge was allocated $1,979,314 to the intangible Website asset and
$766,249 to goodwill.
Loss from operations decreased by $4,507,663, or 52%, to $4,151,711 in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $8,659,374 in the
year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the MOD impairment charge in 2022, as well as lower selling, general and administrative
costs in our corporate function and practice operating costs in our patient service facilities from focused cost cutting efforts.
29

Other Income (Expenses)
Loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2023 was $145,212 resulting from extension and early repayment of notes
payable during the year. Losses represent the excess of the repayment amount over the carrying value (net of unamortized discounts) of the debt
instruments at the time of repayment and the excess of the fair value of extended debt and related warrant consideration over the fair value of debt
before its extension. There were no gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Gain from expiration of liability classified equity instruments was $92,641 in the year ended December 31, 2023 and resulted from the
expiration of liability-classified warrants issued in 2020.
Financing cost in the year ended December 31, 2022 was $110,000, resulting from cash and stock-based fees paid in connection with the
July 2022 SEPA (as defined herein). There were no financing costs in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Amortization of original issue and debt discounts on notes payable and convertible notes in the year ended December 31, 2023 was
$427,808, an increase of $372,526, or 674%, compared to $55,282 in the year ended December 31, 2022. Amortization of discounts arose from
warrants attached to debt instruments and original issue discounts on notes payable. The increase was due to higher notes payable balances, and
therefore corresponding amortizable discount balances, in 2023 compared to 2022.
Gain from realization of contingent sale consideration receivable was $1,090,857 in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting from
actual proceeds received from contingent sale consideration related to the sale of AHP in the third quarter 2023 in excess of the amount estimated
to be received at the time of the sale. Receipts of contingent sale consideration during the year ended December 31, 2023 included $1,750,000
gross ($1,540,000 net) in Incremental Cash Consideration and $1,873,993 gross ($1,186,231 net) from the 2022 MSSP Consideration.
Gain from the change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration decreased by $768,905, or 99%, to $11,094 in the year ended
December 31, 2023, compared to $779,999 in the year ended December 31, 2022. Because contingent acquisition consideration related to our
acquisition of MOD is payable in a fixed number of shares, changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration fluctuates with our
share price. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our share price decreased substantially, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the
contingent acquisition consideration liability and a corresponding gain from the change in fair value. With the repayment of NCFM contingent
acquisition consideration in 2022 and the derecognition of CHM/AHP contingent acquisition consideration with the AHP Sale, the only remaining
contingent acquisition consideration relates to MOD earnout year 4.
Interest expense increased by $60,987, or 267%, to $83,812 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $22,825 in the year ended
December 31, 2022, due to an increase in interest-bearing notes payable to related parties and third parties since the fourth quarter of 2022.
Total other income (expenses) decreased by $54,132, or 9%, to income of $537,760 in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to
income of $591,892 in the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily a result of a $1,090,857 gain from realization of contingent
sale consideration receivable related to the collection of consideration in the AHP Sale in 2023 and financing costs incurred in 2022, offset by lower
gains from changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration and higher debt-related interest and discount amortization charges in 2023.
Loss from continuing operations decreased by $4,453,531, or 55%, to $3,613,951 in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to
$8,067,482 in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decreased loss was due primarily to reduced overhead and practice operating costs in 2023
from focused cost cutting efforts, lower impairment charges in 2023, and a gain from realization of contingent sale consideration receivable related
to the collection of consideration in the AHP Sale in 2023. These improvements were offset by lower gains from changes in fair value of contingent
acquisition consideration and higher debt-related interest and discount amortization charges in 2023.
30

Gain (loss) from operations of discontinued operations
As a result of the AHP Sale on January 17, 2023, our ACO/MSO Division was classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Loss from operations of discontinued operations decreased
by $675,941, or 90%, from $748,262 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $72,321 in the year ended December 31, 2023. The decreased loss
was due primarily to the fact that the business operated for a full year in 2022, while the 2023 loss reflects only two weeks of operations in 2023 as
well as winding down costs of the discontinued operation after the sale on January 17, 2023.
Effective January 17, 2023, we completed the AHP Sale, at which time we discontinued the operations of CHM and ceased to have a
controlling financial interest in AHP. In connection with the AHP Sale, as of January 17, 2023, we recognized the fair value of consideration
received and receivable from the AHP Sale, recognized an indemnification liability related to potential claims resulting from the AHP Sale,
derecognized the carrying value of assets and liabilities transferred to the Buyer or otherwise derecognized in connection with in the AHP Sale, and
recorded a gain on sale for the excess of consideration received over carrying value of assets derecognized and liabilities recognized. Accordingly,
we recorded a gain from disposal of AHP in the amount of $2,674,069 in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Net loss
Net loss decreased by $7,803,541, or 89%, to $1,012,203 in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8,815,744 in the year ended
December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of (i) the gain from disposal of AHP in the amount of $2,674,069 in the year ended December 31, 2023, (ii)
lower impairment charges in 2023, (iii) a $1,090,857 gain from realization of contingent sale consideration receivable related to the collection of
consideration in the AHP Sale in 2023, and (iv) lower selling, general and administrative costs in our corporate function and practice operating
costs from focused cost cutting efforts. The improvements were offset by lower gains from changes in fair value of contingent acquisition
consideration and higher debt-related interest and discount amortization charges in 2023.
Seasonal Nature of Operations
We do not experience any material seasonality related to any of our continuing operations. Prior to the discontinuation of our ACO/MSO
Division, that division’s primary source of revenue was from payments earned under the Medicare shared savings program for which shared
savings determinations were made annually by the CMS in the third calendar quarter of each year, resulting in potential revenue spikes in the third
quarter. With the sale of the ACO/MSO Division in January 2023, we will no longer be subject to this type of seasonality.
Impairment
Impairment reviews of long-lived assets
Long-lived assets (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset groups held for use are tested for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of
the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-
lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If
this comparison indicates that the asset is not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow model. An
impairment charge is then recorded for any excess carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances indicate that an
impairment may be necessary. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group.
Fair value is estimated using the same approach as described above for long-lived asset testing.
The significant assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow models are revenue growth rate, gross profit margins on product sales,
operating income margin, and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. Among other inputs, revenue
growth rate and operating income margin are determined by management using historical performance trends, projected performance from
existing partnerships, industry data, relevant changes in the reporting unit’s underlying business, and other market trends that may affect the
reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the
industry in which the reporting unit operates. The assumptions used in the DCF model are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty. Changes
in projected revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, projected operating income margins, or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market
conditions, loss of our sole product supplier in the Medical Distribution reporting unit, losses of key physicians in our Health Services reporting
unit, changes in technology, or other factors, could result in one or more of our reporting units with a significant amount of identifiable intangible
assets recognizing material impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations and financial position. Our historical or
projected revenues or cash flows may not be indicative of actual future results.
31

Impairment of MOD Website and Goodwill – 2022
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required impairment assessments of the MOD
Website. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during 2022, and during fourth quarter 2022 in particular, from the
reporting unit’s existing customer base, (ii) delays in realization of material increases in revenue from new marketing channels, and (iii) an inability
to achieve profitability during 2022 despite a fundamental pricing and profit margin restructuring implemented in fourth quarter of 2022. We
determined that the asset group, which included the MOD Website and goodwill related to MOD, was not recoverable and, accordingly, recorded
an impairment charge in the amount of $2,745,563 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to adjust carrying value to its estimated fair value of $-0-.
The impairment charge was allocated $1,979,314 to the intangible Website asset and $766,249 to goodwill.
The fair value of our MOD Website and goodwill was determined using an expected present value approach, which applies a market
discount rate to a probability-weighted stream of cash flows based on multiple scenarios, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of
the MOD Website and goodwill rely on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows
used in the impairment review.
Impairment of AEU Goodwill – 2023
During the third quarter of 2023, we determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the AEU
goodwill. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, and (ii) an inability of the business to achieve
profitability since its acquisition. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amount of
impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. We determined that the carrying amount of the
reporting unit, which consists of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge in the amount
of $319,958 to adjust carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of $-0- in the year ended December 31, 2023.
The fair value of AEU reporting unit was determined using an expected present value approach, which applies a market discount rate to a
probability-weighted stream of cash flows based on multiple scenarios, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of the AEU reporting
unit and goodwill rely on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows used in the
impairment review.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Condition
During the second quarter of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial
Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update
provided U.S. GAAP guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to
continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. Under this standard, we are required to evaluate whether there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating our ability to continue as a
going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern within 12 months after our financial statements were issued (April 1, 2025).
Management considered our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash
flows and our obligations due before April 1, 2025 and concluded that, without additional funding, we will not have sufficient funds to meet our
obligations within one year from the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. Without raising additional capital, either via additional
advances made pursuant to the SEPA or from other sources, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through
April 1, 2025. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. This
basis of presentation contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
We are subject to a number of risks, including uncertainty related to product development and generation of revenues and positive cash
flow from our Digital Healthcare division and a dependence on outside sources of capital. The attainment of profitable operations is dependent on
future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill our growth and operating activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to
support our cost structure.
As of December 31, 2023, we had cash balances of $247,222, a working capital deficit of $1,755,864 and an accumulated deficit of
$42,033,136. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $1,012,203, which included a gain from the sale of AHP of $2,674,069
and a gain from the realization of contingent sale consideration receivable related to the sale of AHP of $1,090,857. Loss from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,613,951 and we used cash from operating activities of $4,144,868. We expect to continue
to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next 12 months.
32

Significant Liquidity Transactions
Through December 31, 2023, we have funded our operations principally through a combination of sales of our common stock, convertible
and non-convertible promissory notes, government issued debt, and related party debt, as described below.
On July 5, 2022, we entered into the SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd. (“Yorkville”). Pursuant to the SEPA, we have the right to sell to Yorkville up to
30,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at our request any time during the three-year commitment period set forth in
the SEPA. Because the purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for the shares of common stock sold by us to Yorkville pursuant to the
SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of our common stock during the applicable pricing period, we cannot reliably predict the
actual purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for those shares, or the actual gross proceeds we will receive from those sales, if any.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 225,000 shares of common stock, receiving $18,765 in proceeds, all of which was applied to the
balance of a July 19, 2022 promissory note payable to Yorkville that was retired in the year ended December 31, 2023. We have not sold any shares
under the SEPA since January 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 19 notes payable, including 12 to related parties and 7 to third parties, for aggregate
net proceeds of $2,481,749. We also made repayments on notes payable totaling $2,507,662.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 15,952,992 shares of common stock to six separate sophisticated investors in private
placement transactions. We received $850,000 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with the stock sales, we also issued 7,330,662 five-year
warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.08 and $0.20 per share and a 6-month warrant to purchase 5,000,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.05.
On January 17, 2023, we entered into the AHP Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to buy, and we agreed to sell, AHP.
We received $750,000 upon signing of the AHP Merger Agreement, $31,381 in March 2023 for the Stub Period Reimbursement, $1,750,000
($1,540,000 net after commissions) in Incremental Cash Consideration during June, July and August for meeting participating physician transfer
milestones, and $1,873,993 gross ($1,186,231 net after commissions) in October 2023 from the 2022 MSSP Consideration. We may receive future
proceeds comprised of proceeds from sale of shares of the Buyer if the Buyer completes an initial public offering by February 1, 2025 and up to
$500,000 of the Physician Advance Consideration from the Buyer’s plan year 2023 (and if necessary, 2024) MSSP Shared Savings.
Without raising additional capital, whether via additional advances made pursuant to the SEPA, from the sale of equity or debt instruments,
from contingent consideration related to the sale of the ACO/MSO Division, or from other sources, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern through April 1, 2025. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of presentation contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
Plan of operation and future funding requirements
Our plan of operations is to profitably operate our Health Services business and continue to invest in our Digital Healthcare business,
including our cloud-based online personal medical information and record archiving system, the “HealthLynked Network.”
We are marketing the HealthLynked Network by targeting large health systems, hospitals and universities. In addition, we are marketing via
direct-to-patient marketing, affiliated marketing campaigns, co-marketing with our Medical Distribution businesses subsidiary MOD, and expanded
southeast regional sales efforts. Our initial sales strategy is utilizing Internet-based marketing to increase penetration to targeted geographical
areas. These campaigns are focused on both physician practices and patient members. We also are leveraging MOD’s discounted medical supplies
as an offering to our patient and physician members in the HealthLynked Network. We also intend to utilize physician telesales through the use of
telesales representatives whom we will hire as access to capital allows. If we fail to complete the development of, or successfully market, the
HealthLynked Network, our ability to realize future increases in revenue and operating profits could be impacted, and our results of operations and
financial position would be materially adversely affected.
We plan to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing plan of operation.

operations of our discontinued ACO/MSO Division, which was sold in January 2023. Net cash used in continuing operating activities increased by
$346,072, due primarily to more cash received in the fourth quarter of 2022 for the sale of NCFM Medical Membership and Concierge Services at

(net of $18,765 received from sales of common stock under the SEPA that were applied to the balance of the Note Payable) and $2,481,749 from
the issuance of notes payable, offset by $2,507,662 repayments made against notes payable balances (net of $18,765 received from sales of
common stock under the SEPA that were applied to the balance of the Note Payable). Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 was comprised

of the Note Payable), $943,300 from the issuance of notes payable, and $222,072 repayments against notes payable balances (net of $279,415

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
HealthLynked Corp. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HealthLynked Corp. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023
and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations, limited cash flow, and an
accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

HEALTHLYNKED CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 1 - BUSINESS AND BUSINESS PRESENTATION
HealthLynked Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2014. On September 2, 2014, the Company filed
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada setting the total number of authorized shares at 250,000,000
shares, which included up to 230,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock. On February 5, 2018,
the Company filed an Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares.
The Company currently operates in three distinct divisions: the Health Services Division, the Digital Healthcare Division, and the Medical
Distribution Division. The Health Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) Naples Women’s Center (“NWC”), a multi-specialty medical
group including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology) and General Practice, (ii) Naples Center for Functional Medicine (“NCFM”), a
Functional Medical Practice engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care, (iii) Bridging the
Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”), a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida that provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques
to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery, and (iv) Aesthetic Enhancements Unlimited (“AEU”), a patient
service facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services acquired by the Company in May 2022. The Digital Healthcare division
develops and operates an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked Network,” which enables patients and
doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. The Medical Distribution Division is comprised of the
operations of MedOffice Direct LLC (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices
throughout the United States.
During October 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell the Company’s ACO/MSO (Accountable Care
Organization / Managed Service Organization) Division, comprised of the operations of Cura Health Management LLC (“CHM”) and its subsidiary
ACO Health Partners LLC (“AHP”), which operates an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) and Managed Service Organization (“MSO”) that
assists physician practices in providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) as
administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”). On January 17, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the “AHP Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which PBACO Holding, LLC, an operator of ACOs, (“Buyer”) agreed to buy, and the
Company agreed to sell, AHP. See Note 4, “Discontinued Operations,” for additional information.
These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
On a consolidated basis, the Company’s operations are comprised of the parent company, HealthLynked Corp., and its five subsidiaries: NWC,
NCFM, BTG, MOD and AEU. Results through January 17, 2023 also include operations of AHP, which was sold, and CHM, which was discontinued,
both effective as of January 17, 2023. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. In addition,
certain amounts in the prior periods’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Uncertainty Due to Geopolitical Events
Due to the Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy. Although these events did
not have a direct material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, at this time the Company is
unable to fully assess the aggregate impact the Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine conflicts will have on its business due to various uncertainties,
which include, but are not limited to, the duration of the conflicts, the conflicts’ effect on the economy, the impact on the Company’s businesses and
actions that may be taken by governmental authorities related to the conflicts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows:
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. All amounts referred to in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions about fair valuation of acquired intangible assets; cash flow and fair value assumptions
associated with measurements of contingent sale consideration receivable, contingent acquisition consideration payable, and impairment of
intangible assets and goodwill; valuation of inventory; collection of accounts receivable; the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation
expense; valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and borrowing rate consideration for right-of-use (“ROU”) lease assets including related lease
liability and useful life of fixed assets.
Revenue Recognition
Patient service revenue
Patient service revenue is earned for patient services provided to patients at our NWC facility, functional medicine services provided to patients at
our NCFM facility, and physical therapy services provided to patients at our BTG facility. Patient service revenue is reported at the amount that
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing patient care. These amounts are due from patients
and third-party payors (including health insurers and government programs) and include variable consideration for retroactive revenue
adjustments due to settlement of audits, reviews, and investigations. Generally, the Company bills patients and third-party payors within days after
the services are performed and/or the patient is discharged from the facility. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by the Company. Revenue for performance obligations
satisfied over time includes revenue from NCFM annual access contracts (called the Medical Membership and Concierge Program prior to October
1, 2023 and Optimal Health 365 Access Plan thereafter), NWC annual administration fees, and BTG physical therapy bundles. Revenue from NCFM
Medical Memberships and Concierge contracts and NWC annual administration fees, which include bundled products and services that have
substantially the same pattern of transfer to the customer, is recognized over the period of delivery, which is the same as the period of the contract
(typically, one year). Revenue from prepaid BTG physical therapy bundles, for which performance obligations are satisfied over time as visits are
incurred, is recognized based on actual visits incurred in relation to total expected visits. At inception of such contracts, the Company recognizes
contract liabilities for the value of services to be provided and, where applicable, contract assets for recoverable amounts incurred to obtain a
customer contract that would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company believes that these methods provide a faithful
depiction of the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligations based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligation.
Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, which includes all patient service revenue other than NCFM annual access
contracts, NWC annual administration fees, and BTG physical therapy bundles, is recognized when goods or services are provided at the time of the
patient visit, and at which time the Company is not required to provide additional goods or services to the patient.
The Company determines the transaction price based on standard charges for goods and services provided, reduced by contractual adjustments
provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with the Company’s policy, and/or implicit price concessions
provided to uninsured patients. Estimates of contractual adjustments and discounts require significant judgment and are based on the Company’s
current contractual agreements, its discount policies, and historical experience. The Company determines its estimate of implicit price concessions
based on its historical collection experience with this class of patients. There were no material changes during the years ended December 31, 2023
or 2022 to the judgments applied in determining the amount and timing of patient service revenue.

HEALTHLYNKED CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Agreements with third-party payors typically provide for payments at amounts less than established charges. A summary of the payment
arrangements with major third-party payors follows:
● Medicare: Certain inpatient acute care services are paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge based on clinical, diagnostic and
other factors. Certain services are paid based on cost-reimbursement methodologies subject to certain limits. Physician services are paid
based upon established fee schedules. Outpatient services are paid using prospectively determined rates;
● Medicaid: Reimbursements for Medicaid services are generally paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge, per occasion of
service, or per covered member.
● Other: Payment agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider
organizations provide for payment using prospectively determined rates per discharge, discounts from established charges, and
prospectively determined daily rates.
Laws and regulations concerning government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are complex and subject to varying interpretation. As a
result of investigations by governmental agencies, various health care organizations have received requests for information and notices regarding
alleged noncompliance with those laws and regulations, which, in some instances, have resulted in organizations entering into significant
settlement agreements. Compliance with such laws and regulations may also be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as
significant regulatory action, including fines, penalties, and potential exclusion from the related programs. There can be no assurance that
regulatory authorities will not challenge the Company’s compliance with these laws and regulations, and it is not possible to determine the impact,
if any, such claims or penalties would have upon the Company. In addition, the contracts the Company has with commercial payors also provide for
retroactive audit and review of claims.
Settlements with third-party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and
are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing patient care. These settlements are estimated based on the terms
of the payment agreement with the payor, correspondence from the payor and the Company’s historical settlement activity, including an
assessment to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the
uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustment is subsequently resolved. Estimated settlements are adjusted in future periods as
adjustments become known, or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations.
The Company also provides services to uninsured patients, and offers those uninsured patients a discount, either by policy or law, from standard
charges. The Company estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and for those who are uninsured based on
historical experience and current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charge by
any contractual adjustments, discounts, and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally
recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of the change. Patient services provided by NCFM, BTG and AEU are provided on
a cash basis and not submitted through third party insurance providers.
Product and Other Revenue
Revenue is derived from the distribution of medical products that are sourced from a third party. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in
time when title transfers to customers and the Company has no further obligation to provide services related to such products, which occurs when
the product ships. The Company is the principal in its revenue transactions and as a result revenue is recorded on a gross basis. The Company has
determined that it controls the ability to direct the use of the product provided prior to transfer to a customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling
the promise to provide the product to its customer, has discretion in establishing prices, and ultimately controls the transfer of the product to the
customer. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in revenue. Contract liabilities related to product revenue are recognized
when payment is received but for which the Company has not met its product fulfillment performance obligation.
Sales are made inclusive of sales tax, where such sales tax is applicable. Sales tax is applicable on sales made in the state of Florida, where the
Company has physical nexus. The Company has determined that it does not have economic nexus in any other states. The Company does not sell
products outside of the United States.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Company maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product within a specified period of time prior to and subsequent to the
expiration date of the product. The Company analyzes the need for a product return allowance at the end of each period based on eligible products.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of six months or less to be cash and
cash equivalents. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company
had $-0- and $-0- in cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Accounts Receivable
Trade receivables related to NWC services billed to third party payors are carried at the estimated collectible amount. Trade credit is generally
extended on a short-term basis; thus trade receivables do not bear interest. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability
based on past collectability of the insurance companies, government agencies, and customers’ accounts receivable during the related period which
generally approximates 58% of total billings. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at this net amount. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the
Company’s gross patient services accounts receivable were $34,481 and $98,180, respectively, and net patient services accounts receivable were
$20,861 and $49,777, respectively, based upon net reporting of accounts receivable. The Company also had consulting accounts receivable of $-0-
and $22,506 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
was $-0- and $-0-, respectively.
Other Comprehensive Income
The Company does not have any activity that results in Other Comprehensive Income.
Leases
Upon transition under ASU 2016-02, the Company elected the suite of practical expedients as a package applied to all of its leases, including (i) not
reassessing whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) not reassessing the lease classification for any expired or existing
leases, and (iii) not reassessing initial direct costs for any existing leases. For new leases, the Company will determine if an arrangement is or
contains a lease at inception. Leases are included as ROU assets within other assets and ROU liabilities within accrued expenses and other
liabilities and within other long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company’s
leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date
in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease
expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 8 for more complete details on balances as of the
reporting periods presented herein.
Inventory
Inventory consisting of supplements, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Outdated inventory is directly charged to cost of goods sold.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is
not amortized, but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require. Impairment losses are recognized
whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.
F-11

HEALTHLYNKED CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or
whenever it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in
combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the estimated useful
life is determined to be indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized primarily over useful lives of five years. The straight-line
method of amortization is used as it has been determined to approximate the use pattern of the assets. Impairment losses are recognized if the
carrying amount of an intangible that is subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds
its fair value. See Note 7, “Intangible Assets and Goodwill,” for further discussion of impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2023
and 2022.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to a concentration of credit risk are cash and accounts receivable. There are no
patients/customers that represent 10% or more of the Company’s revenue or accounts receivable. Generally, the Company’s cash and cash
equivalents are in checking accounts. The Company relies on a sole supplier for the fulfillment of substantially all of its product sales made through
MOD.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. When retired or otherwise disposed, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the respective accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from disposition, is reflected in earnings. For consolidated
financial statement purposes, property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives of 5 to 7 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized.
The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their
recorded value may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its
book value.
Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities
Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. In determining fair value, the accounting standards have established a
three-level hierarchy that distinguishes between (i) market data obtained or developed from independent sources (i.e., observable data inputs) and
(ii) a reporting entity’s own data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability (i.e., unobservable data inputs).
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in one of the following categories, in order of priority of
observability and objectivity of pricing inputs:
● Level 1 – Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● Level 2 – Fair value based on significant directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant indirectly observable data
through corroboration with observable market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities or (iii) information derived from or corroborated
by observable market data;
● Level 3 – Fair value based on prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data inputs. Inputs would normally be a
reporting entity’s own data and judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The fair value measurement level for an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
F-12

HEALTHLYNKED CORP.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Company utilizes a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options, warrants, beneficial conversion features and
other Level 3 financial assets and liabilities. The Company believes that the binomial lattice model results in the best estimate of fair value because
it embodies all of the requisite assumptions (including the underlying price, exercise price, term, volatility, and risk-free interest-rate) necessary to
fairly value these instruments and, unlike less sophisticated models like the Black-Scholes model, it also accommodates assumptions regarding
investor exercise behavior and other market conditions that market participants would likely consider in negotiating the transfer of such an
instruments.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees and nonemployees under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” using the fair value-based method. Under this method,
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair
value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Company uses a binomial lattice
pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and warrants granted.
Income Taxes
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes (“ASC 740-10”) for recording the provision for income
taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets
and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred
income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability during each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for
deferred income taxes in the period of change. Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense
items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods. Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on
the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or
liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and are
considered immaterial. No income tax has been provided for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, since the Company has sustained a loss
for both periods. Due to the uncertainty of the utilization and recoverability of the loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets, management
has determined a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets, since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realizable.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The carrying value of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities is their cost, which may differ from fair value. The carrying value of
cash held as demand deposits, money market and certificates of deposit, marketable investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
accrued liabilities approximated their fair value.
Deemed Dividend
Through December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a deemed dividend on Series B Convertible Preferred Voting Stock (the “Series B Preferred”).
As the intrinsic price per share of the Series B Preferred was less than the deemed fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
issuance of the Series B Preferred, the Series B Preferred contained a beneficial conversion feature as described in FASB ASC 470-20, “Debt with
Conversion and Other Options.” The difference in the stated conversion price and estimated fair value of the common stock was accounted for as a
beneficial conversion feature and affected income or loss available to common stockholders for purposes of earnings per share available to common
stockholders. The Company may incur further deemed dividends on certain of its warrants containing a down-round provision equal to the
difference in fair value of the warrants before and after the triggering of the down round adjustment.

Net Loss per Share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported a net loss and excluded all outstanding
stock options, warrants and other dilutive securities from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because inclusion of these securities
would have been anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, potentially dilutive securities were comprised of (i) 77,414,648 and 68,109,094
warrants outstanding, respectively, (ii) 5,093,738 and 5,222,982 stock options outstanding, respectively, (iii) 1,484,488 and 1,651,435 unissued
shares subject to future vesting requirements granted pursuant to the Company’s Employee Incentive Plan, (iv) up to 2,764,352 and 2,585,542
common shares issuable that are earned but not paid under consulting and director compensation arrangements, and (v) up to 13,750,000 and
13,750,000 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series B Preferred.
Common Stock Awards
The Company grants common stock awards to non-employees in exchange for services provided. The Company measures the fair value of these
awards using the fair value of the services provided or the fair value of the awards granted, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value
measurement date of these awards is generally the date the performance of services is complete. The fair value of the awards is recognized on a
straight-line basis as services are rendered. The share-based payments related to common stock awards for the settlement of services provided by
non-employees is recorded on the consolidated statement of operations in the same manner and charged to the same account as if such settlements
had been made in cash. From time to time, the Company also issues stock awards settleable in a variable number of common shares. Such awards
are classified as liabilities until such time as the number of shares underlying the grant is determinable.
Warrants
In connection with certain financing, consulting and collaboration arrangements, the Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its
common stock. The outstanding warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are
classified as equity awards. The Company measures the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes pricing model as of the measurement date.
The Company uses a binomial lattice pricing model to estimate the fair value of compensation options and warrants. Warrants issued in conjunction
with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital of the common stock issued. All
other warrants are recorded at fair value as expense over the requisite service period, or at the date of issuance, if there is not a service period.
Certain of the Company’s warrants include a so-called down round provision. The Company accounts for such provisions pursuant to ASU No. 2017-
11, Earnings Per Share, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and Derivatives and Hedging, which calls for the recognition of a deemed dividend in
the amount of the incremental fair value of the warrant due to the down round when triggered.
Business Segments
The Company uses the “management approach” to identify its reportable segments. The management approach designates the internal
organization used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the basis for identifying the Company’s reportable
segments. Using the management approach, the Company determined that it has three operating segments: Health Services (multi-specialty
medical group including the NWC GYN practice, the NCFM functional medicine practice, the BTG physical therapy practice, and the AEU cosmetic
services practice), Digital Healthcare (develops and markets the “HealthLynked Network,” an online personal medical information and record
archive system), and Medical Distribution (comprised of the operations of MOD, a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both
consumers and medical practices).
The Company’s ACO/MSO segment was sold on January 17, 2023. As described in further detail in Note 4, “Discontinued Operations,” this unit’s
assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 and the unit’s results of operations are classified as “Income (loss) from
operations of discontinued operations” in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Recently Issued Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment
Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other
segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in
ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280, on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with
early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
(“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as
disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with
early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.
There have been no other recent accounting pronouncements, changes in accounting pronouncements or recently adopted accounting guidance
during the year ended December 31, 2023 that are of significance or potential significance to us.
Recently Adopted Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments.” The amendments in this update are to
clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to a variety of ASC topics. The changes in ASU 2020-03 are not expected to have a
significant effect on current accounting practices. The ASU improves various financial instrument topics in the Codification to increase stakeholder
awareness of the amendments and to expedite the improvement process by making the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by
eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2022 with early application permitted. The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2023. The adoption did
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to apply Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize
and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. Public entities must adopt
the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2023. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
No other new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on
our consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 3 – LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN ANALYSIS
Liquidity and Going Concern
During the second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update provided U.S. GAAP guidance on management’s
responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote
disclosures. Under this standard, the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, management
considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within 12
months after the Company’s financial statements were issued (April 1, 2025). Management considered the Company’s current financial condition
and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and the Company’s obligations due before April 1, 2025.
The Company is subject to a number of risks, including uncertainty related to product development and generation of revenues and positive cash
flow from its Digital Healthcare division and a dependence on outside sources of capital. The attainment of profitable operations is dependent on
future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill the Company’s growth and operating activities and generating a level of revenues
adequate to support the Company’s cost structure.

NOTE 3 – LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances of $247,222, a working capital deficit of $1,755,864 and an accumulated deficit of
$42,033,136. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $1,012,203, which included a gain from the sale of AHP of
$2,674,069 and a gain from the realization of contingent sale consideration receivable related to the sale of AHP of $1,090,857. Loss from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,613,951 and the Company used cash from operating activities of $4,144,868.
The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next 12 months.
Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions described above in relation to the Company’s ability to meet its obligations and
concluded that, without additional funding, the Company will not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations within one year from the date the
consolidated financial statements were issued.
As described further in Note 4, “Discontinued Operations,” on January 17, 2023, the Company entered into the AHP Merger Agreement, pursuant
to which the Buyer agreed to buy, and the Company agreed to sell, AHP. The Company received $750,000 upon signing of the AHP Merger
Agreement, the $31,381 Stub Period Reimbursement (defined below) in March 2023, $1,750,000 ($1,540,000 net after commissions) during June,
July and August 2023 for meeting 100% of the participating physician transfer milestones outlined in the AHP Merger Agreement, and $1,873,993
($1,186,231 net after commissions and other expenses) related to AHP’s Plan Year 2022 MSSP shared savings. The Company may also receive
future proceeds under the AHP Merger Agreement comprised of (i) up to $500,000 from the Buyer’s plan year 2023 (and if necessary, 2024) MSSP
Shared Savings to reimburse amounts advanced to participating physicians at signing, and (ii) proceeds from sale of shares of the Buyer’s common
stock if the Buyer completes an initial public offering by February 1, 2025.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company also (i) received net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable to related parties and
third parties totaling $2,481,749 for the issuance of 19 separate notes payable and made repayments on existing and new notes payable to related
parties and third parties totaling $2,507,662, and (ii) received $850,000 proceeds from the sale of its common stock.
On July 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the “SEPA”) with YA II PN, Ltd. (“Yorkville”) (See Note 13,
“Shareholders’ Equity,” below for additional information on the SEPA). Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company shall have the right to sell to Yorkville
up to 30,000,000 of its shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at the Company’s request any time during the three-year commitment
period set forth in the SEPA. Because the purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for the shares of common stock sold by the Company to
Yorkville pursuant to the SEPA, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of the Company’s common stock during the applicable pricing
period, the Company cannot reliably predict the actual purchase price per share to be paid by Yorkville for those shares, or the actual gross
proceeds to be raised by the Company from those sales, if any. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 225,000 shares of
common stock under the SEPA, receiving $18,765 in proceeds, all of which was applied to the balance of a July 19, 2022 promissory note payable to
Yorkville that was retired in March 2023.
Without raising additional capital, either via additional advances made pursuant to the SEPA or from other sources, there is substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through April 1, 2025. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of presentation contemplates the recovery of the Company’s
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

NOTE 4 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Description of Transaction
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Board approved a plan to sell the Company’s ACO/MSO Division, which assists physician practices in
providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the MSSP as administered by the CMS, which rewards providers for efficiency in
patient care. On January 17, 2023, the Company entered into the AHP Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to buy, and the
Company agreed to sell, AHP (the “AHP Sale”). Pursuant to the terms of the AHP Merger Agreement, the Company received or will receive the
following consideration: (1) $750,000 in cash paid upon signing of the definitive agreement (received January 18, 2023) (the “Upfront Cash
Consideration”); (2) up to $1,750,000 net incremental cash based on the agreement to participate in Buyer’s ACO by AHP’s existing physician
practices or newly added practices, scaled based on the number of covered patients transferred to PBACO by July 31, 2023 (the “Incremental Cash
Consideration”), of which $1,225,000 ($1,180,000 net after commissions) was received in June 2023 and $150,000 ($120,000 net after
commissions) was received in July 2023; (3) net proceeds, including allocation for expenses, from any MSSP Shared Savings related to AHP’s plan
year 2022 (the “2022 MSSP Consideration”), of which the Company realized gross receipts of $1,873,993 and net proceeds of $1,186,231 after
payments to participating physicians and commissions in October 2023; (4) in the event that Buyer completes a planned initial public offering
(“IPO”) by February 1, 2025, shares in the public entity at the time of the IPO with a value equal to AHP’s 2021 earnings before interest, taxes
depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) times the multiple of EBITDA used to value the public entity’s IPO shares, net of any cash consideration
previously paid by the Buyer and subject to vesting requirements detailed in the AHP Merger Agreement (the “IPO Share Consideration”); (5)
$500,000 of the Incremental Cash Consideration will be allocated to AHP’s participating physicians upon receipt and will be reimbursed to
HealthLynked by the Buyer in 2024 from the Buyer’s plan year 2023 (and if necessary, 2024) MSSP Shared Savings (the “Physician Advance
Consideration”); and (6) the Buyer shall reimburse the Company for expenses incurred by the Company in operating AHP from January 1, 2023 to
January 16, 2023 (the “Stub Period Reimbursement”)($31,381 paid in March 2023). The Company is also required to indemnify the Buyer against
liabilities arising from Buyer’s operation of AHP prior to the Buyer’s IPO date, less a deductible equal to 1% of the aggregate merger consideration
(the “Indemnification Clause”).
In the event Buyer goes public through means other than an IPO, the parties agreed to modify the terms of the IPO Share Consideration to
implement such alternate structure. In the event Buyer does not go public by IPO or other means by February 1, 2025, the Company receives no
IPO Share Consideration, and the Transaction consideration is capped at the cash consideration of up to $3,000,000 plus the MSSP Consideration.
Any participating physician advances will be repaid to the Company out of AHP’s 2023 performance year MSSP Shared Savings, which would be
received in 2024.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, formal transfer of the equity ownership of AHP from the Company to the Buyer will occur at the
earlier of (i) Buyer’s IPO, (ii) Buyer going public by other means, or (iii) if Buyer does not go public, on February 1, 2025. Until that time, the
Company has the right, but not the obligation, to reacquire AHP for a price equal to any consideration already paid by the Buyer for AHP, plus all
expenses incurred by Buyer in operating AHP after January 16, 2023.
Concurrent with the AHP Merger Agreement, AHP and the Buyer also entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “MSA”), pursuant to
which the Buyer assumed full control of managing AHP’s business operations and paying AHP’s operating expenses after January 16, 2023. The
term of the MSA is from January 17, 2023 to August 1, 2024, which is the latest date that equity ownership of AHP can transfer from the Company
to the Buyer. The Buyer agreed in the Merger Agreement to reimburse the Company for reasonable expenses incurred by the Company in
operating AHP from January 1, 2023 to January 16, 2023, which we refer to as the Stub Period Reimbursement, during which time the Company
had operational and financial control of AHP and CHM. Concurrent with the AHP Merger Agreement and the MSA, and as a result of the Buyer
assuming control and responsibility of AHP’s operations, the Company discontinued its operations of CHM.
Discontinued Operations
The Company has classified the results of the ACO/MSO Division as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the assets and liabilities associated with the ACO/MSO Division transferred to the Buyer in the
transaction are classified as held for sale in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.

Net cash used in operations of the ACO/MSO Division was $124,846 and $689,070 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
There were no cash flows from investing or financing activities of the ACO/MSO Division in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Derecognition and Gain from Disposal of Discontinued Operations
As a result of the AHP Sale and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the AHP Merger Agreement and the MSA, the Company ceased to have a
controlling financial interest in AHP as of January 17, 2023. Accordingly, in connection with the transaction, the Company deconsolidated AHP as of
January 17, 2023.
In connection with the deconsolidation, the Company recognized the fair value of consideration received and receivable from the AHP Sale,
recognized an indemnification liability related to potential claims resulting from the AHP Sale, derecognized the carrying value of assets and
liabilities transferred to the Buyer or otherwise derecognized in connection with in the AHP Sale, and recorded a gain on sale for the excess of
consideration received over carrying value of assets derecognized and liabilities recognized.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 4 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)
The Company elected to record the contingent portion of consideration receivable at fair value on the sale date pursuant to the guidance in FASB
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 09-4, “Seller Accounting for Contingent Consideration,” (“EITF 09-4”). The fair value of consideration received
and receivable is shown in the following table:
Upfront Cash Consideration paid at signing $ 750,000
Incremental Cash Consideration 1,311,567
IPO Share Consideration 1,463,517
2022 MSSP Consideration 312,987
Physician Advance Consideration 199,645
Stub Period Reimbursement 31,381
Total fair value of contingent consideration receivable 3,319,097
Total fair value of consideration received and receivable $ 4,069,097
The fair value of contingent consideration receivable was determined using an expected present value approach, which applies a discount rate to a
probability-weighted stream of net cash flows based on multiple scenarios, as estimated by management. As such, the fair values of contingent
consideration receivable rely on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions and there is uncertainty in the expected future cash flows used in
the fair valuation. Significant assumptions related to the valuation of contingent consideration receivable include the likelihood of a Buyer IPO, the
valuation of the Buyer’s common stock in a potential IPO, the likelihood that AHP would meet its performance benchmarks to the extent that it will
receive shared savings for plan year 2022, the likelihood that AHP under the management of the Buyer would receive sufficient shared savings in
plan years 2023 and/or 2024 to pay the Physician Advance Consideration, and the likelihood that the Company would be able to transfer or add new
participating physicians to AHP before July 31, 2023 in order to collect the Incremental Cash Consideration.
The book value of the assets and liabilities derecognized on January 17, 2023 in connection with the sale were as follows:
Prepaid expenses $ 1,500
Intangible asset - ACO physician contract 1,073,000
Goodwill 381,856
Contract liability (20,278)
Contingent acquisition consideration (185,024)
Net Book Value of Assets and Liabilities Sold $ 1,251,054
Prepaid expenses are prepaid services from which the Buyer will benefit following the AHP Sale. Intangible assets and goodwill represent the
carrying value of assets recorded at the time the Company acquired CHM and AHP in 2020 (the “Original Acquisition”). Contract liability
represents remaining unearned revenue for which the Buyer is required to provide the performance obligations after January 17, 2023. In
connection with the AHP Sale, the remaining value of contingent acquisition consideration (“CAC”) related to the Original Acquisition was written
off.
After recording the fair value of consideration and derecognition of assets and liabilities, and an estimated liability related to the Indemnification
Clause, the Company recorded a gain from disposal of discontinued operations in the amount of $2,674,069 as follows:
Total fair value of consideration received and receivable $ 4,069,097
Less: net book value of assets and liabilities sold (1,251,054)
Less: fair value of Indemnification Clause (143,974)
Gain from disposal of discontinued operations $ 2,674,069
After January 17, 2023, and as prescribed under EITF 09-4, the Company has elected to subsequently treat the contingent consideration receivable
using gain contingency guidance and only record a gain or loss when the contingency is resolved. Accordingly, the Company does not prospectively
remeasure the fair value of contingent consideration receivable each reporting period.

Intangible assets, net $ 883,848 $ 1,112,007
Goodwill $ --- $ 319,958
Goodwill and intangible assets recorded during 2022 and 2023 arose from the acquisitions of NCFM in April 2019, MOD in October 2020, and AEU
in May 2022. Prior to December 31, 2022, the NCFM medical database was assumed to have an indefinite life and was not amortized. As of
December 31, 2022, the Company determined that developing healthcare technologies have the potential to render certain of the protocols in the
NCFM medical database obsolete. Accordingly, the Company determined that the NCFM medical database should be prospectively amortized over
an estimated five-year useful life. Prior to its impairment in 2022 as described below, the Company had recorded an intangible asset related to the
MOD website, which was being amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of five years. Amortization expense related to
intangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $228,159 and $715,800, respectively.
Goodwill arose as a result of the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired related to the
acquisitions of MOD and AEU. Goodwill related to MOD and AEU was fully impaired in 2022 and 2023, respectively, as described below.

NOTE 8 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL (CONTINUED)
Impairment of MOD Website and Goodwill
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that triggering events had occurred that required impairment assessments of the MOD
Website. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during 2022, and during fourth quarter 2022 in particular, from the
reporting unit’s existing customer base, (ii) delays in realization of material increases in revenue from new marketing channels, and (iii) an inability
to achieve profitability during 2022 despite a fundamental pricing and profit margin restructuring implemented in fourth quarter of 2022. An
impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset that is subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future
cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s (or asset group’s)
carrying value over its fair value. The Company determined that the asset group, which included the MOD Website and goodwill related to MOD,
was not recoverable and, accordingly, recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $2,745,563 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to adjust
carrying value to its estimated fair value of $-0-. The impairment charge was allocated $1,979,314 to the intangible Website asset and $766,249 to
goodwill.
Impairment of AEU Goodwill
In connection with the acquisition of AEU in May 2022, the Company recorded goodwill of $319,958, representing the excess fair value of
consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
During the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined that triggering events had occurred that required an impairment assessment of the AEU
goodwill. The triggering events included (i) a material decline in revenue during third quarter 2023, and (ii) an inability of the business to achieve
profitability since its acquisition. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The amount of
impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. The Company determined that the carrying
amount of the reporting unit, which consists of the AEU practice, exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an
impairment charge in the amount of $319,958 to adjust carrying value of AEU goodwill to its estimated fair value of $-0- in the year ended
December 31, 2023.

Employee Equity Incentive Plans
On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 EIP”) for the purpose of having equity awards available to
allow for equity participation by its employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The 2016 EIP allowed for the issuance of up to 15,503,680
shares of the Company’s common stock, which may be issued in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, or common shares. The 2016
EIP is governed by the Board, or a committee that may be appointed by the Board in the future. The 2016 EIP expired during 2021 but allows for
the prospective issuance of common shares upon vesting of stock awards or exercise of stock options granted prior to expiration of the 2016 EIP.
On September 9, 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 EIP” and, together with the 2016 EIP, the “EIPs”) for the
purpose of having equity awards available to allow for equity participation by its employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The 2021 EIP
allows for the issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which may be issued in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, or common shares. The 2021 EIP is governed by the Board, or a committee that may be appointed by the Board in the future.

forfeiture rates were 20% and 20% in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Liability-Classified Equity Instruments
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made certain stock grants from the 2021 EIP that vest over a four-year period and that
are settleable for a fixed dollar amount rather than a fixed number of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made an
additional grant of stock options from the 2021 EIP with a fixed fair value that may be earned based on achievement of performance targets on a
quarterly basis through June 2025. At inception of each grant, the Company recognized an asset captioned “Deferred equity compensation” and an
offsetting liability captioned as a “Liability-classified equity instrument” related to such instruments. Amortization of deferred stock compensation
assets in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $10,353 and $46,771, respectively. The Company also de-recognized Deferred equity
compensation and Liability-classified equity instrument in the amount of $64,647 and $13,338 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, based on failure to achieve targets and termination of future rights under such grants.

NOTE 15 – CONTINGENT ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION
Contingent acquisition consideration relates to future earn-out payments potentially payable related to the Company’s acquisitions of Hughes
Center for Functional Medicine (“HCFM”) in 2019 and CHM and MOD in 2020. The terms of the earn-outs related to each acquisition require the
Company to pay the former owners additional acquisition consideration for the achievement of prescribed revenue and/or earnings targets for
performance of the underlying business for up to four years after the respective acquisition date. Contingent acquisition consideration for each
entity is recorded at fair value using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow projection. The fair value of the contingent acquisition
consideration is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and changes are included in the statement of operations under the caption
“Change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration.”
Contingent acquisition consideration as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the following:
December 31,

Net gain on change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration $ 11,094 $ 779,999
All of the remaining $2,189 contingent acquisition consideration related to MOD matures in 2024 based on the performance of the business unit for
the year ended December 31, 2024.
Hughes Center for Functional Medicine Acquisition – April 2019
On April 12, 2019, the Company acquired a 100% interest in HCFM, a medical practice engaged in improving the health of its patients through
individualized and integrative health care. Under the terms of acquisition, the Company paid the seller $500,000 in cash, issued 3,968,254 shares
of the Company’s common stock and agreed to an earn-out provision of $500,000 that may be earned based on the performance of NCFM in the
years ended on the first, second and third anniversary dates of the acquisition closing. The total consideration fair value represented a transaction
fair value of $1,764,672. In May 2020, the Company paid the seller $47,000 in satisfaction of the year 1 earn out. In May 2021, the Company paid
the seller $196,000 in satisfaction of the year 2 earn out. In May 2022, the Company paid the seller $207,384 in satisfaction of the year 3 earn out.
The Company has no further earn-out obligations related to the NCFM acquisition.
Cura Health Management LLC Acquisition – May 2020
On May 18, 2020, the Company acquired a 100% interest in CHM and its wholly owned subsidiary AHP. The acquisition consideration included an
earnout of up to $62,500, $125,000, $125,000 and $125,000 cash for years 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, based on achievement by the underlying
business of revenue of at least $2,250,000 (50% weighting) and profit of at least $500,000 (50% weighting) in the year preceding each anniversary
date of the closing (the “Future Earnout”). On January 17, 2023, the Company entered into the AHP Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the
Buyer agreed to buy, and the Company agreed to sell, AHP.

MedOffice Direct LLC Acquisition – October 2020
On October 19, 2020, the Company acquired a 100% interest in MOD, a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers
and medical practices throughout the United States. Under the terms of acquisition, the Company paid the following consideration: (i) 19,045,563
shares of Company common stock issued at closing, (ii) partial satisfaction of certain outstanding debt obligations of MOD in the amount of
$703,200 in cash paid by the Company, and (iii) up to 10,004,749 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock over a four-year period based
on MOD achieving revenue targets in calendar years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 of $1,500,000, $1,875,000, $2,344,000, and $2,930,000,
respectively. The first, second and third years of earnout measured based on performance in calendar years 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively,
were not met. Because the MOD earnout is payable in a fixed number of shares for each earnout year, the fair value of MOD contingent acquisition
consideration is dependent in large part on the price of the Company’s stock.

Employment/Consulting Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with certain of its physicians, nurse practitioners and physical therapists in the Health Services division.
The agreements generally call for a fixed salary plus performance-based pay.
On October 13, 2022, the Company entered into an offer letter (the “Agreement”) with George O’Leary in his continuing capacity as Chief Financial
Officer of the Company. The Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2022 and provides that Mr. O’Leary’s base salary will be $259,000 per year, with
annual review and adjustment at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, and an annual incentive bonus of 25% of annual salary based on the achievement of the Company of certain financial metrics as
approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, Mr. O’Leary will be eligible for a cash bonus of $50,000 upon the uplisting of the Company
and completion of a financing round at the time of uplisting. The Agreement provided that Mr. O’Leary would receive a grant of 100,000 shares of
restricted stock upon execution of the Agreement and additional grants of 100,000 restricted shares on each of July 1, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Mr.
O’Leary was also granted 1,200,000 stock options with an exercise price of $0.06, a portion of which are subject to time vesting and a portion of
which are subject to vesting upon the achievement of certain of the Company’s corporate objectives and Mr. O’Leary’s individual objectives.
Concurrently, the Company and Mr. O’Leary entered into a Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete Agreement, effective as of
September 20, 2022 that contains a non-solicitation and non-compete provision which will be in effect for a two-year period following the
termination of Mr. O’Leary’s employment relationship with the Company. On January 5, 2024, Mr. O’Leary tendered his resignation as Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, effective April 4, 2024. Mr. O’Leary will continue to serve the Company as a member of the Board.
On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Michael Dent, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of
Directors. Dr. Dent’s employment agreement continues until terminated by Dr. Dent or the Company. If Dr. Dent’s employment is terminated by the
Company (unless such termination is “For Cause” as defined in his employment agreement), then upon signing a general waiver and release, Dr.
Dent will be entitled to severance in an amount equal to 12 months of his then-current annual base salary, as well as the pro-rata portion of any
bonus that would be due and payable to him. In the event that Dr. Dent terminates the employment agreement, he shall be entitled to any accrued
but unpaid salary and other benefits up to and including the date of termination, and the pro-rata portion of any unvested time-based options up
until the date of termination.
Litigation
From time to time, the Company may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business.
However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
the Company’s business. The Company is not aware of any such legal proceedings that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.
NOTE 17 – INCOME TAXES
The tax reform bill that Congress voted to approve December 20, 2017, also known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, made sweeping modifications to
the Internal Revenue Code, including a much lower corporate tax rate, changes to credits and deductions, and a move to a territorial system for
corporations that have overseas earnings. The act replaced the prior-law graduated corporate tax rate, which taxed income over $10 million at
35%, with a flat rate of 21%. Due to the continuing loss position of the Company, management believes changes from the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”
should not be material in the periods presented.
The components of earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022
NOTE 17 – INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had available for income tax purposes approximately $36.8 million and $35.5 million,
respectively, in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, which may be available to offset future taxable income, of which $3.2 million
expire in 2035-37 and $33.6 million carry forward indefinitely. Due to the uncertainty of the utilization and recoverability of the loss carry-forwards
and other deferred tax assets, Management has determined a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets, since it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will not be realizable.
Prior to 2014, the Company was an S-Corporation, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. During 2014, the Corporation defaulted to C-
Corporation status. Pre C-Corporation losses were passed through to qualified S-Corporation shareholders. The net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryovers presented in this note are C-Corporation losses. NOLs are subject to limitations imposed by IRC Section 382/383 resulting from changes
in ownership. At the date of this filing, management has not reviewed the Company’s ownership changes and will perform the study in advance of
any potential use of the NOLs. Based upon management’s assessment, a full valuation allowance has been placed upon the net deferred tax assets,
since it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Therefore, no financial statement benefit has been taken for the deferred tax
assets, as of the filing date.
The Company has not taken any uncertain tax positions on any of its open income tax returns filed through the period ended December 31, 2022.
The Company’s methods of accounting are based on established income tax principles in the Internal Revenue Code and are reflected within its
filed income tax returns on an accrual basis. The Company re-assesses the validity of its conclusions regarding uncertain tax positions on a
quarterly basis to determine if facts or circumstances have arisen that might cause the Company to change its judgment regarding the likelihood of
a tax position’s sustainability under audit. The Company has determined that there were no uncertain tax positions for the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022.
NOTE 18 – SEGMENT REPORTING
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had three reportable segments: Health Services, Digital Healthcare, and Medical Distribution. The Health
Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) NWC, a multi-specialty medical group including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology),
and General Practice, (ii) NCFM, a Functional Medical Practice acquired in April 2019 that is engaged in improving the health of its patients
through individualized and integrative health care, (iii) BTG, a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, Florida that provides hands-on
functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery, and (iv) AEU, a patient
service facility specializing in minimally and non-invasive cosmetic services acquired by the Company in May 2022. The Digital Healthcare segment
develops and plans to operate an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked Network,” which will enable
patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. The Medical Distribution Division is comprised
of the operations of MOD, a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the
United States.
On January 17, 2023, the Company entered into the AHP Merger Agreement pursuant to which the Company sold AHP and discontinued the
operations of CHM, comprising its ACO/MSO Division. The Company has classified the results of the ACO/MSO Division as discontinued operations
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the assets and liabilities associated with the
ACO/MSO Division were classified as held for sale in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. See Note 4,

The Digital Healthcare made intercompany sales of $790 and $830 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to
subscription revenue billed to and paid for by the Company’s physicians for access to the HealthLynked Network. The Medical Distribution segment
made intercompany sales of $22,617 and $38,713 in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to medical products sold
to practices in the Company’s Health Services segment. Intercompany revenue and the related costs are eliminated on consolidation.
NOTE 19 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate
their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of such instruments. The Company measures certain financial instruments at fair value on
a recurring basis, including certain convertible notes payable and related party loans, which were extinguished and reissued and are therefore
subject to fair value measurement, derivative financial instruments arising from conversion features embedded in convertible promissory notes for
which the conversion rate was not fixed, and equity-class. All financial instruments carried at fair value fall within Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy as their value is based on unobservable inputs. The Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value
measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination
requires significant judgments to be made.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, and in light of the material
weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of December 31, 2023.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC, internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and implemented by our Board of Directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this
assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management identified the following material weaknesses that have caused
management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting,
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:
1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to
have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and
has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
2. During the 2023 audit, we recorded adjusting journal entries, the effects of which were material, both individually and in the aggregate,
to the financial statements as a whole. Though adjusted in the audited financial statements, the adjustment or the matters underlying
them could potentially cause future period financial statements to be materially misstated.
Remediation of Material Weaknesses
To remediate the material weakness in our documentation of internal controls we intend to formally document the design of our internal
control policies and procedures when resources allow. To remediate the material weakness regarding adjusting journal entries, we intend to
implement internal control procedures related to the affected areas, which include intangible asset valuation and recognition of contract liabilities
at certain of our patient service facilities.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except for the matters discussed above, there was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Board Committees
Audit Committee
Our audit committee is comprised of independent directors Dan Hall (Chairperson) and Heather Monahan. Mr. Hall qualifies as an “audit
committee financial expert” as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
Report of the Audit Committee
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management. The audit committee has

Heather Monahan
Compensation Committee
Our compensation committee is comprised of independent directors Robert Gasparini, and Heather Monahan.
Nominating and Governance Committee
