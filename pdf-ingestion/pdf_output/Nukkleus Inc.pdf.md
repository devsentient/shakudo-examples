PART I
Item 1. Business.
Nukkleus Inc. (formerly known as, Compliance & Risk Management Solutions Inc.) (the “Company” or “Nukkleus”) was formed on July 29, 2013 in
the State of Delaware as a for-profit Company and established a fiscal year end of September 30.
Overview
We are a financial technology company which is focused on providing software and technology solutions for the worldwide retail foreign exchange
(“FX”) trading industry. We primarily provide our software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology hardware
and software solutions package to Triton Capital Markets Ltd. (“TCM”), formerly known as FXDD Malta Limited (“FXDD Malta”). The FXDD brand
(e.g., see FXDD.com) is the brand utilized in the retail forex trading industry by TCM.
As part of the Assets acquired, we acquired ownership of FOREXWARE, the primary software suite and technology solution which powers the FXDD
brand globally today. We also have ownership of the FOREXWARE brand name. We have also acquired ownership of the customer interface and
other software trading solutions being used by FXDD.com. By virtue of our relationship with TCM and FXDirectDealer LLC (“FXDIRECT”), we
provide turnkey software and technology solutions for FXDD.com. We offer the customers of FXDD 24 hour, five days a week direct access to the
global over the counter (“OTC”) FX market, which is a decentralized market in which participants trade directly with one another, rather than
through a central exchange.
In an FX trade, participants effectively buy one currency and simultaneously sell another currency, with the two currencies that make up the trade
being referred to as a “currency pair”. Our software and technology solutions enable FXDD to present its customers with price quotations on over
the counter tradeable instruments, including over the counter currency pairs, and also provide our customers the ability to trade FX derivative
contracts on currency pairs through a product referred to as Contracts for Difference (“CFD”). Our software solutions also offer other CFD
products, including CFDs on metals, such as gold, and on futures linked to other products.
In July 2018, the Company incorporated Nukkleus Malta Holding Ltd., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary. In July 2018, Nukkleus Malta Holding
Ltd. incorporated Markets Direct Technology Group Ltd (“MDTG”), formerly known as Nukkleus Exchange Malta Ltd. MDTG was exploring
potentially obtaining a license to operate an electronic exchange whereby it would facilitate the buying and selling of various digital assets as well
as traditional currency pairs used in FX Trading. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, management made the decision to exit the exchange
business and to no longer pursue the regulatory licensing necessary to operate an exchange in Malta.
On August 27, 2020, the Company renamed Nukkleus Exchange Malta Ltd. to Markets Direct Technology Group Ltd (“MDTG”). MDTG manages the
technology and IP behind the Markets Direct brand (which is operated by TCM). MDTG holds all the IP addresses and all the software licenses in its
name, and it holds all the IP rights to the brands such as Markets Direct and TCM. MDTG then leases out the rights to use these names/brands
licenses to the appropriate entities.
On May 24, 2021, the Company and the shareholders of Match Financial Limited (the “Match Shareholders”), a private limited company formed in
England and Wales (“Match”), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Match Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company, on May 28,
2021, acquired 1,152 ordinary shares of Match representing 70% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Match in consideration of
70,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Initial Transaction”). On August 30, 2021, the Company exercised its option pursuant to
which it acquired from the Match Shareholders the balance of 493 ordinary shares of Match representing 30% of the issued and outstanding
ordinary shares of Match for an additional 30,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Match is engaged in providing payment services
from one fiat currency to another.
On October 20, 2021, the Company and the shareholders (the “Original Shareholders”) of Jacobi Asset Management Holdings Limited (“Jacobi”)
entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Jacobi Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 5.0% of the issued and
outstanding ordinary shares of Jacobi in consideration of 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Transaction”). On December 15,
2021, the Company, the Original Shareholders and the shareholders of Jacobi that were assigned their interest in Jacobi by the Original
Shareholders (the “New Jacobi Shareholders”) entered into an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement agreeing that the Transaction will be
entered between the Company and the New Jacobi Shareholders. The Transaction closed on December 15, 2021. Jacobi is a company focused on
digital asset management that has received regulatory approval to launch the world’s first tier one Bitcoin ETF.

FXDD Agreements
On May 24, 2016, Nukkleus Limited entered into a General Service Agreement to provide its software, technology, customer sales and marketing
and risk management technology hardware and software solutions package to FML Malta Ltd. In December 2017, Nukkleus Limited, FML Malta
Ltd. and TCM entered into a letter agreement providing that there was an error in drafting the General Service Agreement and acknowledging that
the correct counter-party to Nukkleus Limited in the General Service Agreement is TCM. Accordingly, all references to FML Malta Ltd. have been
replaced with TCM. TCM is a private limited liability company formed under the laws of Malta. The General Service Agreement entered with TCM
provides that TCM will pay Nukkleus Limited at minimum $2,000,000 per month. On October 17, 2017, Nukkleus Limited entered into an
amendment of the General Service Agreement with TCM. In accordance with the amendment, which was effective as of October 1, 2017, the
minimum amount payable by TCM to Nukkleus Limited for services was reduced from $2,000,000 per month to $1,600,000 per month. Emil
Assentato is also the majority member of Max Q Investments LLC (“Max Q”), which is managed by Derivative Marketing Associates Inc. (“DMA”).
Mr. Assentato is the sole owner and manager of DMA. Max Q owns 79% of Currency Mountain Malta LLC, which in turn is the sole shareholder of
TCM.
In addition, on May 24, 2016, in order to appropriately service TCM, Nukkleus Limited entered into a General Service Agreement with FXDIRECT,
which provides that Nukkleus Limited will pay FXDIRECT a minimum of $1,975,000 per month in consideration of providing personnel engaged in
operational and technical support, marketing, sales support, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and
support. FXDIRECT may terminate this agreement upon providing 90 days’ written notice. On October 17, 2017, Nukkleus Limited entered into an
amendment of the General Service Agreement with FXDIRECT. Pursuant to the amendment, which was effective as of October 1, 2017, the
minimum amount payable by Nukkleus Limited to FXDIRECT for services was reduced from $1,975,000 per month to $1,575,000 per month.
Currency Mountain Holdings LLC is the sole shareholder of FXDIRECT. Max Q is the majority shareholder of Currency Mountain Holdings LLC.
The Market Opportunity
The FX market is a global, decentralized market for the trading of currencies. FX trading involves the simultaneous buying and selling of a currency
pair for the purposes of hedging currency risk or to generate a profit. The FX market, once limited to large financial institutions, has expanded and
matured over the past decade, and now captures a wide range of participants, including central banks, commercial banks, non-bank corporations,
hedge funds, brokers and individual investors / traders. The market’s expansion has helped lead to a significant increase in trading activity. In
addition to the increase in the breadth of market participants, key factors driving higher trading volumes include the adoption of electronic and
high frequency trading, tighter trading spreads, rising volatility among currencies and enhanced access to FX trading markets – primarily through
online brokers, such as FXDD – for retail investors.
FX trading, initially utilized primarily for hedging purposes, has evolved as investor sophistication levels have risen, trading costs have fallen, and
as currencies have become increasingly viewed as a viable investment asset class. FX’s low, (or even negative) correlation among certain other
portfolio assets, namely equities and fixed income, may help investors reduce overall portfolio volatility. As such, we believe that currencies are
often viewed as an important portfolio diversification tool.
Fueled by the growing adoption of the internet, the retail segment of the FX market began to emerge in the late 1990s. Developing online
brokerage firms provided individual investors with direct access to the global FX markets. Prior to the development of these trading platforms,
individual retail investors were effectively locked out of the FX market as minimum trade sizes were typically too high for individual retail investors.
Online FX brokers lowered the minimum volume barriers and transactions costs for retail trading, allowing individuals to establish trading accounts
with much lower initial deposits. We believe the retail FX segment now represents the fastest growing portion of the overall FX market. We believe
this growth will be driven by a handful of key market trends, including:
● Increased investor demand for exposure to currencies;
● Increasing internet adoption across the globe;
● Growing engagement of the “offline” market;
● Development of emerging markets and the emergence of an affluent middle class; and
● Increasing regulation resulting in greater confidence.
Participants in the retail FX market are geographically dispersed. Retail FX brokers, such as FXDD are seeking to expand their presence in
projected high growth regional areas, such as Asia and the Middle East.
Systems and Services
Nukkleus provides its services in the following service categories:
Category One: Introducing Broker Dealer Network and the Introducing Broker Interface
Category Two: Chinese and Middle East customer desk support
2

Category Three: Bridging software to the Meta Trader (MT4 and MT 5) platforms
Category Four: Forex Market Liquidity Access
Category Five: Turnkey risk management support software and Risk Management Team
Category Six: Front End Software Retail Trading Platforms and Customer Application Systems
Category Seven: Back Office Systems management
Category One: Introducing Broker Dealer Network
Nukkleus, by arrangement pursuant to our services agreement with TCM and FXDIRECT, provides to TCM clients an introducing broker (IB)
network spread across China, Japan and the Middle East. Our approach to the retail FX market is to focus on the development of relationships with
independent local referring brokers who provide a recurring source of new customers. These referring brokers do not have an exclusive
relationship with us, but are offered a competitive commission structure to deliver new customers to us. Our account managers primarily focus on
building relationships with referring brokers, and master referring brokers (who refer other referring brokers to us), as well as with customers
referred to us by referring brokers and acquired by us directly. We believe this approach, in contrast to retail FX brokers that focus solely or
primarily on acquiring accounts through online marketing campaigns, has allowed us to provide services to TCM, which allows entities to achieve
strong levels of net trading income, and accounts, as well as lower up front customer acquisition costs and greater customer satisfaction. Referring
brokers are typically either individuals who are current or former FX traders or individuals or companies active in the area of FX trading and
education and investment services advisory business.
The Introducing Broker (IB) Interface: The Introducing Broker (“IB”) interface empowers our partners to view real time account data such as
payouts, customer activity and reports.
Category Two: Asia, including Chinese and Middle East Customer Desk Support
Nukkleus, by arrangement pursuant to our services agreement, provides to TCM customer desk support in multiple languages. A key element of the
business strategy is the large, multi-lingual and multi-ethnic team of account managers at the headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, as well as in
certain other locations such as Malta, Jakarta, Indonesia and Tokyo, Japan. We obtained the services of account managers by virtue of our services
agreement with FXDIRECT. Account managers are compensated to a significant degree based on their performance, measured by net deposits
inflows, new accounts funded and trading volume generated by customers. We believe that this compensation structure motivates our account
managers and leads to more active communication with our referring brokers and customers, an improved customer trading experience, improved
referring broker and customer retention and increased deposits.
Category Three: Bridging Software to the Meta Trader (MT4 and MT5) platforms
Meta Trader 4 Bridge: The MT4 Bridge is a middleware product that connects the Meta Trader server with the XW Trading System. The Bridge
passes both market data (i.e. quotes) and trading data (i.e. trade executions) between MT4 and the XW servers. By seamlessly integrating the two,
the Bridge allows for real time trade execution, reduced slippage, and access to liquidity through the XW Liquidity Matrix.
Category Four: Forex Market Liquidity Access
XWare Liquidity Matrix: Dealers need access to as much liquidity as possible. Forexware’s liquidity aggregation technology supports API from most
of the world’s largest liquidity providers, including banks, hedge funds and electronic communication networks (ECN). Our aggregation technology
integrates seamlessly with customers’ existing infrastructure, providing the power to optimize trading processes, manage accounts and revealing
the most relevant information to make effective trading decisions.
The XWare Liquidity Bridge: With the XWare liquidity bridge, brokers can automatically submit trade requests to the liquidity provider of choice
and receive confirmation prior to sending an accept or reject message to the broker’s client. The XWare Liquidity Bridge was developed to improve
liquidity processes, risk and availability by providing a direct line of communication to vital backend processes. Brokers can create unique price
streams from aggregated liquidity with sophisticated control over liquidity sources, pricing models, execution models and risk management.
XWare Live Rate Feed: The XWare Live Rate Feed provides customers with streaming liquidity and prices in real time that integrate seamlessly
with existing trading platforms. The Quote Aggregator identifies outliers and bad ticks to ensure our clients capture accurate and reliable pricing to
protect them from price fluctuations and anomalies that frequently occur with Liquidity Providers.

both to the TCM clients, as well as to third party clients who request this service.
XWare Risk Monitor: The XWare Risk Manager is an essential component of the Forexware’s turnkey Xware suite, offered to new brokers entering
the market, or existing brokers looking to replace their existing systems. Our management is of the belief that the Risk Manager software suite is
the most vigorous and advanced risk management system available in the market today providing customers the power to customize risk
management settings at their fingertips.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Risks Relating to Our Company
Although we commenced operations in May 2016, we rely on TCM as our only customer, and the loss of such customer could
adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
We are a financial technology company which is focused on providing software and technology solutions for the worldwide retail FX trading
industry. We primarily today provide our software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology hardware and
software solutions package to TCM, a related party, which provides that TCM pays us at minimum, $1,600,000 per month. The FXDD brand (e.g.,
see FXDD.com) is the brand utilized in the retail forex trading industry by TCM. We derive all of our revenues under our agreement with TCM. The
loss of such customer, or our failure to replace such customer with other customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and our results of operations.
Although we commenced operations in May 2016, we rely on FXDIRECT as our primary vendor, and the loss of FXDIRECT would have
a significant adverse impact on our business.
In order to appropriately service our only customer, TCM, we entered into a General Service Agreement with FXDIRECT, a related party, which
provides that we pay FXDIRECT at minimum $1,575,000 per month in consideration of providing personnel engaged in operational and technical
support, marketing, sales support, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support. We derive all of our cost
of revenues under our agreement with FXDIRECT. Loss of FXDIRECT could have a significant adverse impact on us.
Our principal client, TCM, has its net trading income and profitability influenced by, among other things, the general level of trading
activity in the FX market and by currency volatility, both of which are beyond our control.
Like other financial services firms, our business and profitability are directly affected by factors that are beyond our control, such as economic and
political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, changes in the volume of foreign currency transactions, changes in supply and demand
for currencies, movements in currency exchange rates and interest rates, changes in the financial strength of market participants, legislative and
regulatory changes, changes in the markets in which such transactions occur, changes in how such transactions are processed and disruptions due
to terrorism, war or extreme weather events. In particular, the net trading income and operating results of our principal client, TCM, are influenced
by the general level of trading activity in the FX market and by currency volatility and may vary significantly from period to period due to
movements and trends in the world’s currency markets and to fluctuations in trading levels. We have generally experienced greater trading volume
and higher net trading income in periods of volatile currency markets. Accordingly, a decline in currency volatility or lower levels of trading
volume, whether or not attributable to any such decline, as well as any of the foregoing other external factors, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result, period to period comparisons of our operating results may not
be meaningful and our future operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations or declines.
Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those
estimates of our future performance.
Although the FXDD brand has been in existence since in 2006, we have not commenced operations under Nukkleus as a financial technology
services company until May 2016. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data.
Reliance on the historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve, particularly in our combined form. Because of the
uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases
in revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or incur losses,
which may result in a decline in our stock price.
Our business requires substantial capital, and if we are unable to maintain adequate financing sources our profitability and financial
condition will suffer and jeopardize our ability to continue operations.
We require substantial capital to support our operations. If we are unable to maintain adequate financing or other sources of capital are not
available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our operations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, financial condition and
business prospects.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our
business.
Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks,
service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos. We have registered or applied to register a number of our
trademarks in many jurisdictions, some of which have been refused. We cannot be certain that our trademark applications will be approved.
Further, third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights.
We may also face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology that is material to our business operations. In the
future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of
the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could
result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management, any of which could negatively affect our business.

Our computer infrastructure may be vulnerable to security breaches. Any such problems could jeopardize confidential information
transmitted over the Internet, cause interruptions in our operations or give rise to liabilities to third parties.
Our computer infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses, distributed denial-of-service attacks and
similar disruptive problems and security breaches. Any such problems or security breaches could give rise to liabilities to one or more third parties,
including our customers, and disrupt our operations. A party able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary
information or customer information, jeopardize the confidential nature of information we transmit over the Internet or cause interruptions in our
operations. Concerns over the security of Internet transactions and the safeguarding of confidential personal information could also inhibit the use
of our systems to conduct FX transactions over the Internet. To the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary
information and personal financial information or other personally identifiable information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of financial
loss, litigation, regulatory penalties, loss of customers and other liabilities. Our current insurance policies may not protect us against all such losses
and liabilities. Any of these events, particularly if they result in a loss of confidence in our services, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We rely on information technology to receive and properly process internal and external data. We may not be able to keep up with the
rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques that characterize
the retail FX market.
We rely on technology to receive and properly process internal and external data. Any disruption for any reason in the proper functioning of our
software or erroneous or corrupted data may cause us to make erroneous trades, accept customers from jurisdictions where we do not possess the
proper licenses, authorizations or permits, or require us to suspend our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, we rely on tools that we have developed in-house to monitor customer exposure and
facilitate our ability to manage risk by transferring higher risk customers to agency accounts. In order to remain competitive, we continuously
develop and refine our proprietary technology. In doing so, there is an ongoing risk that failures may occur and result in service interruptions or
other negative consequences, such as slower trade execution, erroneous trades, or inaccurate risk management information. Moreover, if our
competitors develop more advanced technologies, we may be required to devote additional resources to the development of more advanced
technologies in order to remain competitive, which could adversely impact our profitability. We may not be able to keep up with the rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques that characterize the retail FX market.
We rely on computer systems and services from third-party providers and licenses to third-party software.
We rely on computer systems and services from third-party providers and licenses to third-party trading platforms, back-office systems, Internet
service providers and communications facilities. Any interruption in these third-party products or services, or deterioration in their performance or
quality, could adversely affect our business. If our arrangement with any such third party is terminated, we may not be able to obtain alternative
products or services on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, we and most of our customers access and make use of our FX trading and related
online trading services through the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 trading platforms. The MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 trading platforms are
owned by MetaQuotes Software Corp. (“MetaQuotes”), an independent third party. Nukkleus pays fees to FXDIRECT, in part to access the Meta
Quotes licenses and software which those companies possess and is indirectly made available to us. In the future, MetaQuotes could cease to
license its trading platforms to us or may cease to adequately support such software on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Furthermore, in
the future a superior trading platform may be developed by a competitor to us or a competitor to MetaQuotes and we may be unable to license any
such trading platform. If we are unable to continue to use the MetaTrader 4 trading platform or if we are unable to use any superior trading
platform that may be developed in the future, we may lose customers to our competitors, in which case our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
System failures could cause interruptions in our services or decreases in the responsiveness of our services which could harm our
business.
If our systems fail to perform, we could experience disruptions in operations, slower response times or decreased customer service and customer
satisfaction. Our ability to facilitate transactions successfully and provide high quality customer service depends on the efficient and uninterrupted
operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. Our systems also are vulnerable to damage or interruption from
human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, hacker attacks, computer viruses, intentional acts of
vandalism and similar events. Although we have multiple location redundancy, we do not have fully redundant capabilities. While we currently
maintain a disaster recovery plan, which is intended to minimize service interruptions and secure data integrity, such plan may not work effectively
during an emergency. Any system failure that causes an interruption in our services, decreases the responsiveness of our services or affects access
to our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand, cause customers to stop using our services or materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A systemic market event could impact the various market participants with whom we interact.
We may interact directly and indirectly with various market participants. If a systemic event in the financial system were to occur that were to
result in a failure of any of our counterparties to be able continue to perform, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In the current environment facing financial services firms, a firm’s reputation is critically important. If our reputation is harmed, or
the reputation of the online financial services industry as a whole or retail FX industry specifically is harmed, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be adversely affected if our reputation is damaged. If we fail, or appear to fail, to
deal with issues that may give rise to reputation risk, our business prospects could be harmed. These issues include, but are not limited to,
appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, privacy, customer
data protection, record-keeping, solicitation, sales and trading practices, and the proper identification of the legal, credit, liquidity, operational and
market risks inherent in our business. Failure to appropriately address these issues could also give rise to additional legal risk to us, which could, in
turn, increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against us or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties.
Any such sanction could materially adversely affect our reputation, thereby reducing our ability to attract and retain customers, referring brokers
and employees.
In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected if the reputation of the online financial services industry as a
whole or retail FX industry is damaged. In recent years, a number of financial services firms have suffered significant damage to their reputations
from highly publicized incidents that in turn resulted in significant and in some cases irreparable harm to their business. The perception of
instability within the online financial services industry could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, referring
brokers and employees.
Our client, TCM, has relationships with independent referring brokers who direct new customers to us, which is our principal source
of new customers for TCM. Failure to maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows and, in turn, negatively impact our company.
Our only client, TCM, maintains relationships with independent referring brokers who direct new customers to us and provide marketing and other
services to these customers. TCM relationships with referring brokers are non-exclusive and may be terminated by the brokers on short notice. A
referring broker does not forfeit previously earned commissions upon termination. In addition, under its agreements with referring brokers, they
have no obligation to provide TCM with new customers or minimum levels of transaction volume. Its failure to maintain its relationships with
referring brokers, the failure of the referring brokers to provide TCM with customers or its failure to create new relationships with referring
brokers could result in a loss of net trading income, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. To the extent any of its competitors offers more attractive compensation terms to any of its referring brokers, TCM could
lose the referring broker’s services or be required to increase the compensation it pays to retain the referring broker. In addition, it may agree to
set the compensation for one or more referring brokers at a level where, based on the transaction volume generated by customers directed to it by
such brokers, it would have been more economically attractive to seek to acquire the customers directly rather than through the referring broker.
To the extent it does not enter into economically attractive relationships with referring brokers, its referring brokers may terminate their
relationship with TCM or its referring brokers fail to provide us with customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows could be materially adversely affected.
Any regulation of referring brokers and their activities could disrupt our business model.
TCM depends on referring brokers to acquire most of our customers. If a jurisdiction were to impose regulations restricting referring brokers’
ability to solicit, acquire or interact with customers, we may be unable to continue to acquire customers or do business in that jurisdiction. Any
such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The loss of members of our senior management could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our
growth strategy.
We rely on Mr. Emil Assentato, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to execute our existing business plans and to
identify and pursue new opportunities. Our continued success is dependent upon the retention of Mr. Assentato, as well as the services provided by
our trading staff, technology and programming specialists and a number of other key managerial, marketing, planning, financial, technical and
operations personnel provided through our GSA with FXDIRECT. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change. Adverse changes in the regulatory environment could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The legislative and regulatory environment in which we operate has undergone significant changes in the recent past and there may be future
regulatory changes in our industry. The financial services industry in general has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight in recent years.
The governmental bodies and self-regulatory organizations that regulate our business have proposed and may consider additional legislative and
regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. As a result, in the future, we may become subject to new regulations that
may affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable. For example, a regulatory body may reduce the
levels of leverage we are allowed to offer to our customers, which could significantly adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may also adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
7

Providing online services to customers may require us to comply with the laws and regulations of each country in which such services
are available. Failure to comply with such laws may negatively impact our financial results.
Because our services are available online in foreign countries and TCM has customers residing in foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may
require TCM or us to qualify to do business in such countries. We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of each country in which we
conduct business, including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be enacted related to online services available to their citizens
from service providers located elsewhere, including the laws and regulations of Japan and China. We are exposed to the risk that we are currently
operating in non-compliance with local laws and regulations in certain of the jurisdictions where we accept customers. Any failure to develop
effective compliance and reporting systems could result in regulatory penalties in the applicable jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The FX market has only been widely available to retail investors since 1996. Our limited operating history and the limited history of
the industry may make our growth and future prospects uncertain and difficult to evaluate.
Furthermore, the FX market has only become accessible to retail investors relatively recently. Prior to 1996, retail investors generally did not
directly trade in the FX market, and we believe most current retail FX traders only recently started viewing currency trading as a practical
alternative investment class. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies and industries at a similar
stage of development, including our potential inability to implement our business model and strategy and adapt and modify them as needed or to
manage our expanding operations, including the integration of any future acquisitions.
We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more
limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.
Recent federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures
designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response
to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the New
York Stock Exchange, NYSE American or NASDAQ, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are
required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ are those that address board of directors’ independence, audit committee
oversight and the adoption of a code of ethics. Our Board of Directors has not yet adopted any of the above mentioned corporate governance
measures and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if
we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal
corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For
example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions
concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority
of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of
corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.
Difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations.
As our business needs expand, we may need to hire a significant number of employees. This expansion may place a significant strain on our
managerial and financial resources. To manage the potential growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to:
● improve existing, and implement new, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;
● install enhanced management information systems; and
● train, motivate and manage our employees.
We may not be able to install adequate management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned
personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively,
our business would be seriously harmed.
Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, integration and consolidation risks and we may be unable to
profitably operate our combined company.
We may in the future selectively pursue acquisitions of other financial technology companies or retail FX brokers. Any future acquisitions may
result in significant transaction expenses and present new risks in integrating the acquired companies and to the extent the acquired company
operates in different markets or offers different products associated with entering additional markets. Because we have not historically made
acquisitions, we do not have experience in successfully completing acquisitions. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other
resources to integrate companies we acquire or to successfully operate new businesses and we may be unable to profitably operate our combined
company. Additionally, any new businesses that we may acquire, once integrated with our existing operations, may not produce expected or
intended results.

Risks Associated with Our Common Stock in General
Trading on the Over the Counter markets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock
and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.
Our common stock is quoted on the OTC PINK Current Marketplace owned and operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. and the OTC Pink Sheet
service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) under the symbol NUKK. Trading in stock quoted on over the counter markets is
often thin, volatile, and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or
business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover,
the over the counter markets are not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the over the counter markets is often more sporadic than the
trading of securities listed on other stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange or NYSE American. Accordingly, our
shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.
Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s penny stock regulations and the FINRA’s sales
practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
Our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price
(as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by
the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers
and accredited investors. The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net
worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-
dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form
prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers’ account. The
bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior
to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction.
These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to
these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We
believe that the penny stock rules discourage broker-dealer and investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.
Our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuation which could adversely impact the value of our
common stock.
There has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either
develop or be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations
which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that
factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could
cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in
the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances
that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time.
FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
In addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, FINRA rules require
that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for
that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable
efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of
these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.
FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the
ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares.
Because the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks, some brokers may be
unwilling to trade our securities. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares, which may cause the value of your
investment to decline.
Our shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) which
imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in the aftermarket. For sales of our
securities, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a written agreement prior from you to making a sale on your
behalf. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that broker-dealers will not want to make a market in our
common stock. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your investment to decline.

A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability
to continue operations and we may go out of business.
A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability
to raise capital. Because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through
the sale of equity securities, or convertible debt instruments, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and
our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all
our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business
plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and
not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds
through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business.
Our stock price may be volatile.
The stock market in general has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company.
The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of
which are beyond our control, including the following:
● changes in our industry;
● competitive pricing pressures;
● our ability to obtain working capital financing;
● additions or departures of key personnel;
● limited “public float” in the hands of a small number of persons who sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing
pressure on the market prices of our common stock;
● sales of our common stock;
● our ability to execute our business plan;
● operating results that fall below expectations;
● loss of any strategic relationship;
● regulatory developments;
● economic and other external factors; and
● period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.
In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating
performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
We have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.
We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock to date, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to
pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop one or more properties and generate revenue from operations. Notwithstanding, we
will likely elect to retain any earnings, if any, to finance our growth. Future dividends may also be limited by bank loan agreements or other
financing instruments that we may enter into in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of
Directors.
Future issuances of our common or preferred shares may cause a dilution in your shareholding.
We may raise additional funding to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements for our planned long-term capital needs, or to fund
future acquisitions. If such funding is raised through issuance of new equity or equity-linked securities, it may cause a dilution in the percentage
ownership of our then existing shareholders.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 900,000,000 shares of common stock and 15,000,000 shares of blank check preferred
stock without the need for shareholder approval. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares, which may significantly dilute the equity
interests of our existing shareholders.
We cannot predict our future capital needs. As a result, we may need to raise significant amounts of additional capital. We may be
unable to obtain any necessary capital if we need it on acceptable terms, if at all.
Our business requires adequate funding for operations. Historically, we have satisfied these needs from internally generated funds. We currently
anticipate that our cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements,
including our current expansion plans, for at least the next 12 months. We may need to raise additional funds to, among other things:
● support more rapid expansion;
10

● develop new or enhanced services and products;
● respond to competitive pressures;
● address additional regulatory capital requirements;
● acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies; or
● respond to unanticipated requirements.
Additional financing may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to us. If funding requirements are met by way of
additional debt financing, we may have restrictions placed on us through such debt financing arrangements which may:
● limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consents for the payment of dividends;
● increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
● limit our ability to pursue our business strategies;
● require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund capital expenditure, working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes; and
● limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to
decline.
If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under
Rule 144, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock
could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise
additional financing through the sale of equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.
Item 2. Properties.
The Company’s headquarters are located in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Company uses office space of FXDD, an affiliated company, free of rent,
which is considered immaterial.
We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and planned business operations.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to any
material legal proceedings, except as set forth below.
On April 16, 2020, the Company was named as a defendant in the Adversary Proceeding filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Massachusetts (Case No. 15-10745-FJB; Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01178) titled In re: BT Prime Ltd (“BT Prime”). The BT Prime Litigation
was brought by BT Prime against Boston Technologies Powered by Forexware LLC f/k/a Forexware LLC (“Forexware”), Currency Mountain
Holdings LLC, Currency Mountain Holdings Limited f/k/a Forexware Malta Holdings Ltd., FXDirectDealer, LLC, FXDD Malta Ltd., Nukkleus,
Nukkleus Bermuda Limited and Currency Mountain Holdings Bermuda, Ltd. BT Prime sought, amongst other relief, a determination that the
defendants were liable for all of the debts of BT Prime stemming from its bankruptcy proceedings, and sought to recover certain amounts
transferred to Forexware and FXDD Malta prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy case. In the sole claim asserted against Nukkleus, BT Prime
alleged that Nukkleus acquired certain technology assets from Forexware and is a continuation of the business of Forexware and a successor-in-
interest to Forexware. Based on this theory, BT Prime alleged that Nukkleus should be jointly and severally liable for any liability attributable to
Forexware or the other defendants, should the court eventually find any such liability. Although Nukkleus acquired licenses from Forexware,
Forexware retained other assets and continued to operate a separate business, which Nukkleus believes is the business that is pertinent to BT
Prime’s allegations. Nukkleus believes that the similarity in Forexware and Nukkleus’s business, including the shared use of software, caused BT
Prime to conflate the two businesses, but Nukkleus was not connected to the events that caused the initiation of BT Prime’s liquidation and
bankruptcy proceedings.
Nukkleus has issued a limited guarantee of the obligations under a settlement agreement among BT Prime and the defendants other than
Nukkleus, limited to an amount equal to $2,050,000, which guarantee is subject to release following payment by the defendants other than
Nukkleus of their obligations under the settlement agreement. Nukkleus management believes that the term of the limited guarantee will expire
without any payment obligation or other cost to Nukkleus. On May 31, 2022, the BT Prime Litigation was dismissed with prejudice by the
bankruptcy court as to Nukkleus and FXDD Malta Ltd.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 should
be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included
elsewhere in this report.
Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K involve risks and
uncertainties, including statements as to:
● our future operating results;
● our business prospects;
● any contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;
● the dependence of our future success on the general economy;
● any possible financings; and
● the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations
The ramifications of the outbreak of the novel strain of COVID-19, reported to have started in December 2019 and spread globally, are filled with
uncertainty and changing quickly. Our operations have continued during the COVID-19 pandemic and we have not had significant disruption. Due
to the nature of our business, the technology we use and offer to our customers, and our employees’ ability to work remotely, there was no material
impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial results.
The Company is operating in a rapidly changing environment so the extent to which COVID-19 impacts its business, operations and financial results
from this point forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following:
the duration and scope of the pandemic, and governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response
to the pandemic.
Overview
We are a financial technology company which is focused on providing software and technology solutions for the worldwide retail foreign exchange
(“FX”) trading industry. We primarily provide our software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology hardware
and software solutions package to TCM. The FXDD brand (e.g., see FXDD.com) is the brand utilized in the retail forex trading industry by TCM.
We have ownership of FOREXWARE, the primary software suite and technology solution which powers the FXDD brand globally today. We also
have ownership of the FOREXWARE brand name. We have also acquired ownership of the customer interface and other software trading solutions
being used by FXDD.com. By virtue of our relationship with TCM and FXDIRECT, we provide turnkey software and technology solutions for
FXDD.com. We offer the customers of FXDD 24 hours, five days a week direct access to the global over the counter (“OTC”) FX market, which is a
decentralized market in which participants trade directly with one another, rather than through a central exchange.
In an FX trade, participants effectively buy one currency and simultaneously sell another currency, with the two currencies that make up the trade
being referred to as a “currency pair”. Our software and technology solutions enable FXDD to present its customers with price quotations on over
the counter tradeable instruments, including over the counter currency pairs, and also provide our customers the ability to trade FX derivative
contracts on currency pairs through a product referred to as Contracts for Difference (“CFD”). Our software solutions also offer other CFD
products, including CFDs on metals, such as gold, and on futures linked to other products.
In July 2018, the Company incorporated Nukkleus Malta Holding Ltd., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary. In July 2018, Nukkleus Malta Holding
Ltd. incorporated MDTG, formerly known as Nukkleus Exchange Malta Ltd. MDTG was exploring potentially obtaining a license to operate an
electronic exchange whereby it would facilitate the buying and selling of various digital assets as well as traditional currency pairs used in FX
Trading. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, management made the decision to exit the exchange business and to no longer pursue the
regulatory licensing necessary to operate an exchange in Malta.
13

On August 27, 2020, the Company renamed Nukkleus Exchange Malta Ltd. to Markets Direct Technology Group Ltd (“MDTG”). MDTG manages the
technology and IP behind the Markets Direct brand (which is operated by TCM). MDTG holds all the IP addresses and all the software licenses in its
name, and it holds all the IP rights to the brands such as Markets Direct and TCM. MDTG then leases out the rights to use these names/brands
licenses to the appropriate entities.
On May 24, 2021, the Company and the shareholders of Match Financial Limited (the “Match Shareholders”), a private limited company formed in
England and Wales (“Match”), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Match Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company, on May 28,
2021, acquired 1,152 ordinary shares of Match representing 70% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Match in consideration of
70,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Initial Transaction”). On August 30, 2021, the Company exercised its option pursuant to
which it acquired from the Match Shareholders the balance of 493 ordinary shares of Match representing 30% of the issued and outstanding
ordinary shares of Match for an additional 30,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Match is engaged in providing payment services
from one fiat currency to another.
On October 20, 2021, the Company and the shareholders (the “Original Shareholders”) of Jacobi Asset Management Holdings Limited (“Jacobi”)
entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Jacobi Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 5.0% of the issued and
outstanding ordinary shares of Jacobi in consideration of 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Transaction”). On December 15,
2021, the Company, the Original Shareholders and the shareholders of Jacobi that were assigned their interest in Jacobi by the Original
Shareholders (the “New Jacobi Shareholders”) entered into an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement agreeing that the Transaction will be
entered between the Company and the New Jacobi Shareholders. The Transaction closed on December 15, 2021. Jacobi is a company focused on
digital asset management that has received regulatory approval to launch the world’s first tier one Bitcoin ETF.
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
The Key Performance Indicators outlined below are the metrics that provide management with the most immediate understanding of the drivers of
business performance and tracking of financial targets.
From May 28,
2021
To September 30,
Performance Indicator 2021
Trading volume 7,299,147
Trading revenue $ 86,964
Trading loss $ (675,333)
Average cost per trade $ 25,410
Average trade 243,305
Number of trades 30
Clients active 18
Gross trading margin 1.2%
Gross margin (776.6)%
On May 28, 2021, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Match. There was no comparable information prior to the date the Company
acquired a controlling interest in Match.
Trading volume is measured by number of trades.
Trading revenue represents the top-line revenue generated from trades, before considering the costs associated with the generation of trading
revenue.
Trading loss is measured as trading revenue less the costs of carrying out those trades. During the period from May 28, 2021 (the date the
Company acquired a controlling interest in Match) through September 30, 2021, we engaged with introducing brokers in an effort to expand
trading volume/revenue. The costs associated with introducing brokers increased the average cost per trade however we expect to gain economies
of scale on these fees as the trading volume and average trade value increases.
14

Average cost per trade is driven by bank, front office employee and introducing broker costs. As previously mentioned, we expect to gain
economies of scale for these costs as we will see increased trading volume and average trade value.
Active clients for the period from May 28, 2021 to September 30, 2021 was eighteen. We continue to bring on introducing brokers as well as
increases in marketing spend from which we continue to add new clients.
Gross trading margin is a metric that measures gross revenue to gross trading volume.
Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. When making these estimates and assumptions, we consider our historical experience, our knowledge of economic
and market factors and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Significant estimates during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 include the initial valuation and useful life of intangible
assets, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances, and
valuation of stock-based compensation.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of license and banking infrastructure, which are being amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of 10 years.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. There were no triggering events requiring assessment of impairment as of September
30, 2021. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, no impairment of long-lived assets was recognized.
Revenue Recognition
The Company accounts for revenue under the provisions of ASC Topic 606.
The Company’s revenues are derived from providing:
● General support services under a GSA to a related party. The transaction price is determined in accordance with the terms of the GSA and
payments are due on a monthly basis. There are multiple services provided under the GSA and these performance obligations are combined
into a single unit of accounting. Fees are recognized as revenue over time as the services are rendered under the terms of the GSA. Revenue
is recorded at gross as the Company is deemed to be a principal in the transactions.
● Financial services to its customers. Revenue related to its financial services offerings are recognized at a point in time when service is
rendered.
15

Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC
718”). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and non-employees including grants of stock options, to be recognized as expense
in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option award using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Results of Operations
Summary of Key Results
For the year ended September 30, 2021 versus the year ended September 30, 2020
Revenues
For both of the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had revenue from general support services rendered to TCM under a GSA of
$19,200,000.
We had revenue from financial services commencing in May 2021. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we had revenue from financial services
of $86,964, which represented revenue from May 28, 2021 (the date the Company acquired a controlling interest in Match) to September 30, 2021.
We expect that our revenue from financial services will increase in the near future since we are making efforts on expanding our financial services.
Costs of Revenues
For both of the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our cost of general support services was $18,900,000, which represented amount
incurred for services rendered by FXDIRECT under a GSA.
Cost of financial services include amortization of intangible assets which consist of license and banking infrastructure acquired on Match
acquisition, consulting costs, banking, and trading fees incurred associated with delivery of our services.
Cost of financial services was $762,297 for the year ended September 30, 2021, which represented costs from May 28, 2021 (the date the Company
acquired a controlling interest in Match) to September 30, 2021. There was no comparable revenue nor cost of revenue from our financial services
operations prior to the date the Company acquired a controlling interest in Match.
Gross Profit (Loss)
For both of the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, our gross profit from general support services was $300,000, representing gross margin
of 1.6%.
For the year ended September 30, 2021, our gross loss from financial services was $675,333, representing gross margin of (776.6)%, which was
primarily attributable to a large portion of our cost of financial services are fixed and do not change along with the increase/decrease in our
revenue from financial services. We expect that we can improve our gross margin from financial services segment in the near future since we
anticipated we will generate more revenue from financial services.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consisted of professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.
Professional fees
Professional fees primarily consisted of accounting fees, audit fees, legal service fees, advisory fees, and consulting fees. Professional fees for the
year ended September 30, 2021 versus the year ended September 30, 2020, were $396,277 and $188,000, respectively. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in consulting fees of approximately $126,000 as a result of the increase in use of consulting service providers, an
increase in advisory service fees of approximately $42,000 due to options granted to an advisor in fiscal 2021, and an increase in other
miscellaneous items of approximately $40,000. We expect that our professional fees will increase in the near future since we are seeking for
business merger and acquisition opportunities.
16

Other general and administrative expenses
Other general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of compensation and related benefits and other miscellaneous items.
Total other general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 versus the year ended September 30, 2020, were $160,794
versus $225,115, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in compensation and related benefits of approximately $114,000
resulting from the resignation of the director of crypto management on December 15, 2019, offset by an increase in other miscellaneous items of
approximately $50,000 resulting from our business expansion.
Other (Expense) Income
Other (expense) income mainly included interest expense on redeemable preferred stock, amortization of debt discount, and gain recognized from
investment – digital currency.
Other expense, net, totaled $4,442 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to other income, net, of $12,553 for the year ended
September 30, 2020, a change of $16,995. The change was primarily due to a decrease in gain recognized from change in fair value of digital
currency asset as we transferred all of our investment in digital currency to our affiliates in October 2020 and we are no longer engaged in the
digital currency business since October 2020.
Net Loss
As a result of the factors described above, our net loss was $936,846, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended September 30,
2021, as compared with a net loss of $100,562, or $0.00 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended September 30, 2020, a change of
$836,284, or 831.6%.
Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment
The reporting currency of the Company is U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of the parent company, Nukkleus Inc., Nukkleus Limited, Nukkleus
Malta Holding Ltd. and its subsidiaries, is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of Match Financial Limited and its subsidiaries is the British
Pound (“GBP”). The financial statements of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the GBP are translated to U.S. dollars using period end
rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, average rate of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses and cash flows, and at historical exchange
rates for equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the results of operations. As a result of foreign
currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation gain of $8,440 and $0 for the year ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This non-cash gain had the effect of decreasing our reported comprehensive loss.
Comprehensive Loss
As a result of our foreign currency translation adjustment, we had comprehensive loss of $928,406 and $100,562 for the years ended September
30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on
an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cash balances of $355,673 and $82,849, respectively. We had working capital deficit of
$1,594,793 as of September 30, 2021.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of expenses and our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet
our obligations and pay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations.
We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from
our stockholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Any such
financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact
our business. In the event that there are any unforeseen delays or obstacles in obtaining funds through the aforementioned sources, CMH has
committed to inject capital into the Company in order to maintain the ongoing operations of the business.
Cash Flow for the Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended September 30, 2020
Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $295,887 for the year ended September 30, 2021, which primarily reflected the changes in
operating assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisition, mainly consisting of a decrease in due from affiliates of
approximately $1,092,000 resulting from the payments received from our affiliates in fiscal 2021, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of approximately $114,000, which primarily attributable to the increase in Match’s accounts payable of approximately $55,000 and the
increase in accrued directors’ compensation of approximately $40,000, and the non-cash items mainly consisting of amortization of intangible
assets representing license and banking infrastructure acquired on Match acquisition of approximately $469,000 and stock-based compensation of
approximately $42,000 due to options granted for professional services, offset by consolidated net loss of approximately $937,000, and the changes
in operating assets and liabilities, net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisition, mainly consisting of a decrease in due to affiliates of
approximately $467,000 due to the payments made to our affiliates in fiscal 2021.
17

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $59,335 for the year ended September 30, 2020, which primarily reflected the changes in
operating assets and liabilities, mainly consisting of an increase in due to affiliates of approximately $3,673,000 resulting from the payments
received from our affiliates and expenses paid by our affiliates on behalf of us in fiscal 2020, offset by an increase in due from affiliates of
approximately $3,501,000 due to the payments made to our affiliates and monies that we paid on behalf of our affiliates in fiscal 2020, and
consolidated net loss of approximately $101,000, and the non-cash item mainly consisting of a gain on digital currency of approximately $19,000
resulting from the change in fair market value of digital currency in fiscal 2020.
Net cash flow used in investing activities was $23,302 for the year ended September 30, 2021. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we
made payments for acquisition of approximately $45,000, offset by cash acquired on acquisition of approximately $21,000.
There was no investing activity during the year ended September 30, 2020.
Our operations will require additional funding for the foreseeable future. Unless and until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of revenue
and reduce our costs, we expect to finance future cash needs through public and/or private offerings of equity securities and/or debt financings. We
do not currently have any committed future funding. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders could at
that time experience substantial dilution. Any debt financing we are able to obtain may involve operating covenants that restrict our business. Our
capital requirements for the next twelve months primarily relate to mergers, acquisitions and the development of business opportunities. In
addition, we expect to use cash to pay fees related to professional services. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material
decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term:
● The working capital requirements to finance our current business;
● The use of capital for mergers, acquisitions and the development of business opportunities;
● Addition of personnel as the business grows; and
● The cost of being a public company.
We need to either borrow funds or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from
our stockholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Any such
financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would negatively impact
our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient funds to operate our business or
pursue our planned growth. However, CMH has committed to inject capital into the Company in order to maintain the ongoing operations of the
business.
Consistent with Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our current policy that all transactions between us and our officers,
directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, are approved by
vote of the stockholders, or are fair to us as a corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board. We will conduct an
appropriate review of all related party transactions on an ongoing basis.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations
As of September 30, 2021, we had no material contractual obligations other than: FXDirectDealer LLC receives a minimum of $1,575,000 per
month and such obligation may be terminated by the Company upon providing 90 days’ notice.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency
contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Nukkleus Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nukkleus Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2021 and
2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Correction of a Material Misstatement in Previously Issued Financial Statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statement, the September 30, 2021 financial statements have been restated to correct a misstatement.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

NUKKLEUS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(AS RESTATED)
NOTE 1 – THE COMPANY HISTORY AND NATURE OF THE BUSINESS (continued)
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
applicable for a going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of
business. The Company incurred a net loss for the year ended September 30, 2021 of $936,846, and had a working capital deficit of $1,594,793 at
September 30, 2021. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the management of expenses and ability to obtain
necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable
operations.
We cannot be certain that such necessary capital through equity or debt financings will be available to us or whether such capital will be available
on terms that are acceptable to us. Any such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial
operating covenants that would negatively impact our business. In the event that there are any unforeseen delays or obstacles in obtaining funds
through the aforementioned sources, Currency Mountain Holdings Bermuda, Limited (“CMH”), which is wholly-owned by an entity that is majority-
owned by Mr. Assentato, has committed to inject capital into the Company in order to maintain the ongoing operations of the business.
The ramifications of the outbreak of the novel strain of COVID-19, reported to have started in December 2019 and spread globally, are filled with
uncertainty and changing quickly. Our operations have continued during the COVID-19 pandemic and we have not had significant disruption.
The Company is operating in a rapidly changing environment so the extent to which COVID-19 impacts its business, operations and financial results
from this point forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following:
the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the
pandemic.
NOTE 2 – RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company concluded it should restate its previously issued financial statements by amending its Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the
SEC on December 29, 2021 and amended on June 10, 2022 and July 27, 2022 (the “10K Filing”), to record the classification of amortization of
intangible assets representing licenses and banking infrastructure acquired on Match acquisition. The Company had previously recorded the
amortization of intangible assets as operating expenses. In July 2022, the Company realized its financial services segment is unable to generate
revenue without the licenses and bank infrastructure. As a result, the Company reclassified the amortization of intangible assets from operating
expenses to cost of revenue – financial services.
The following table represents the impacts of the adjustment described above:
As Reported Adjustment As Restated
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the Year Ended September
30, 2021
Cost of revenue - financial services $ 293,011 $ 469,286 $ 762,297
Total costs of revenues $ 19,193,011 $ 469,286 $ 19,662,297
Gross loss - financial services $ (206,047) $ (469,286) $ (675,333)
Total gross profit (loss) $ 93,953 $ (469,286) $ (375,333)
Amortization of intangible assets $ 469,286 $ (469,286) $ -
Total operating expenses $ 1,026,357 $ (469,286) $ 557,071
The reclassifications did not have any impact on consolidated operating loss, net loss or earnings per share, cash flows or balance sheets.
NOTE 3 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
financial information.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. These accounts were
prepared under the accrual basis of accounting. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
NOTE 4 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant
estimates during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 include the initial valuation and useful life of intangible assets, assumptions used
in assessing impairment of long-term assets, valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances, and valuation of stock-based
compensation.

Cash and cash equivalents
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s cash balances by geographic area were as follows:
September 30, September 30,
Country: 2021 2020
United States $ 327,443 92.1% $ 82,675 99.8%

Malta 174 0.0% 174 0.2%
Total cash $ 355,673 100.0% $ 82,849 100.0%
NOTE 4 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents (continued)
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at September 30, 2021 and 2020.
Credit risk and uncertainties
The Company maintains a portion of its cash in bank and financial institution deposits within U.S. that at times may exceed federally-insured limits
of $250,000. The Company manages this credit risk by concentrating its cash balances in high quality financial institutions and by periodically
evaluating the credit quality of the primary financial institutions holding such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such bank
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. At September 30, 2021, the Company’s cash balances in United
States bank accounts had approximately $77,000 in excess of the federally-insured limits.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable. A
portion of the Company’s sales are credit sales which is to the customer whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing
in these areas; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to short-term payment terms. The
Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk.
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts
Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt
as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors,
including the age of the balance, a customer’s payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off
after exhaustive efforts at collection.
Management believes that the accounts receivable are fully collectable. Therefore, no allowance for doubtful accounts is deemed to be required on
its accounts receivable at September 30, 2021. The Company historically has not experienced significant uncollectible accounts receivable.
Prepaid expense and other current assets
Prepaid expense and other current assets primarily consist of prepaid OTC Markets listing fees, which are recognized as expense over the related
listing periods. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, prepaid expense and other current assets amounted to $12,221 and $7,010, respectively.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist of license and banking infrastructure, which are being amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of 10 years.
Impairment of long-lived assets
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. There were no triggering events requiring assessment of impairment as of September
30, 2021. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, no impairment of long-lived assets was recognized.

Revenue recognition
The Company accounts for revenue under the provisions of ASC Topic 606.
The Company’s revenues are derived from providing:
● General support services under a GSA to a related party. The transaction price is determined in accordance with the terms of the GSA and
payments are due on a monthly basis. There are multiple services provided under the GSA (including operational reporting and technical
support infrastructure, website hosting and marketing solutions, accounting maintenance, risk monitoring services, new account processing
and customer care and continued support) and these performance obligations are combined into a single unit of accounting. Fees are
recognized as revenue over time as the services are rendered under the terms of the GSA. The Company recognizes the full contracted
amount each period with no deferred revenue. The nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods or services directly
to the customer. The Company engages another party to satisfy the performance obligation on its behalf. The Company’s performance
obligation is not to arrange for the provision of the specified good or service by another party. The Company is primarily responsible for
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service. Therefore, the Company is deemed to be a principal in the transaction and
recognizes revenue for that performance obligation. The Company is a financial technology company which is focused on providing software
and technology solutions for the worldwide retail foreign exchange (“FX”) trading industry. Under a General Services Agreement (“GSA”),
the Company is contractually obligated to provide for the fulfillment software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk
management technology hardware and software solutions package to Triton Capital Markets Ltd. (“TCM”) The Company provides these
services, obtained from affiliate service provider FXDirect Dealer, LLC which is under common ownership, and controls the services of its
service provider necessary to legally transfer of the services to TCM. Consequently, the Company is defined as the principal in the
transaction. The Company, as principal, satisfies its obligation by providing ongoing service support enabling TCM to conduct its retail FX
business without interruption. Upon satisfaction of its obligation, the Company recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration it is
entitled to receive. The monthly GSA price is calculated by applying the Company’s 1.6% mark-up to the costs of the services being provided
by FXDirect Dealer, LLC.
● Financial services to its customers. Revenue related to its financial services offerings are recognized at a point in time when service is
rendered.
Disaggregation of revenues
The Company’s revenues stream detail are as follows:

$17,874 and $0, respectively, which was included in other general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss.
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC
718”). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees and non-employees including grants of stock options, to be recognized as expense
in the statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. The Company estimates the grant date fair value of each option award using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

NOTE 4 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial
reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and
liabilities generating the differences.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the
potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company’s financial position and results of operations for
the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward
period under the Federal and foreign tax laws. Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in
judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of
the change in estimate.
The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 Uncertainty in Income Taxes (ASC 740-10). Certain recognition thresholds must be met
before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a
“more-likely-than-not” threshold.
Foreign currency translation
The reporting currency of the Company is U.S. Dollars. The functional currency of the parent company, Nukkleus Inc., Nukkleus Limited, Nukkleus
Malta Holding Ltd. and its subsidiaries, is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of Match Financial Limited and its subsidiaries is the British
Pound (“GBP”). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting
currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates during each
reporting period, and shareholders’ equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for
the periods, therefore, amounts reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on
the consolidated balance sheet. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S.
dollars are included in determining comprehensive income/loss.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction
dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the
balance sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. Most of the Company’s revenue transactions are transacted
in the functional currency of the Company. The Company does not enter into any material transaction in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or
losses have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.
Asset and liability accounts at September 30, 2021 were translated at 0.7426 GBP to $1.00, respectively, which were the exchange rates on the
balance sheet dates. Equity accounts were stated at their historical rates. The average translation rates applied to the statements of operations for
the period from May 28, 2021 through September 30, 2021 was 0.7224 GBP to $1.00, respectively. Cash flows from the Company’s operations are
calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rate.
Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and all changes to the statements of equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes
in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. For the Company, comprehensive loss for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of net
loss and unrealized gain from foreign currency translation adjustment.
Segment reporting
The Company uses “the management approach” in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal
organization and reporting used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source for determining the Company’s reportable segments. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”),
who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. The Company has
determined that it has two reportable business segments: general support services segment, and financial services segment. These reportable
segments offer different types of services and products, have different types of revenue, and are managed separately as each requires different
operating strategies and management expertise.

Per share data
ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) with a reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes
dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.
Basic net earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during each period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options (using
the treasury stock method) and the conversion of Series A preferred stock (using the if-converted method). Common stock equivalents are not
included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. In a period in which the Company has a net loss, all
potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact. The
following table summarizes the securities that were excluded from the diluted per share calculation because the effect of including these potential
shares was antidilutive:
Years Ended

Convertible preferred stock 1,250,000 1,250,000

Reclassification
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the
previously reported financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“Topic 326”). The ASU introduces a new accounting model, the
Current Expected Credit Losses model (“CECL”), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit
risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses at the time the financial
asset is originated or acquired. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual period beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim reporting periods
within those annual reporting periods. The Company expects that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurements (“ASU 2018-13”), which aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement
users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing fair value measurement disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and
interim periods in the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Retrospective adoption is required, except for
certain disclosures, which will be required to be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial
fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this guidance as of October 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes
by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The
amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption of this guidance as of October 1, 2020 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not
anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

ordinary shares of Match for an additional 30,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The shares of common stock issued to the Match
stockholders have been valued at $0.14 per share which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on May 28, 2021, the date the Initial
Transaction closed.
As described in Note 1, in fiscal year 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Match in accordance with the terms of the Match Agreement.
To determine the accounting for this transaction under ASU 2017-01, an assessment was made as to whether an integrated set of assets and
activities should be accounted for as an acquisition of a business or an asset acquisition. The guidance requires an initial screen test to determine if
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If
that screen is met, the set is not a business. In connection with the acquisition, substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in license and
banking infrastructure. As such, the acquisition has been treated as an acquisition of Match assets and an assumption of Match liabilities.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred direct transaction costs of approximately $47,000 which have been classified as costs of
acquisition. The costs of acquisition are allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition, and any excess is allocated to intangible assets (licenses and banking infrastructure). The costs of acquisition exceeded the fair value of
net assets acquired by approximately $14 million. The Company allocated the $14 million excess to intangible assets (licenses and banking
infrastructure). The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value the
identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date. The straight-line method of amortization represents the Company’s best estimate of the
distribution of the economic value of the identifiable intangible assets. The amortization costs of intangible assets (licenses and banking
infrastructure) were included in cost of revenue – financial services.
The following summarizes total consideration transferred to the March Stockholders under the acquisition as well as the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed under the acquisition:
May 28,
2021
Assets acquired:
Cash $ 21,370
Accounts receivable 46,602
Other current assets 142
Intangible assets 14,010,631
Total assets 14,078,745
Liabilities assumed:
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 78,745
Total liabilities 78,745
Purchase price $ 14,000,000
The fair values of the current assets acquired and the current liabilities assumed were estimated to be equal to the carrying value on the books of
the acquired entity. The acquisition cost of all other assets and liabilities acquired were allocated to those individual assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, based on their estimated relative fair values. Upon completion of a third party valuation report being prepared in connection with the
acquisition, the Company may adjust the estimated allocation to reflect the results of that valuation if there are material differences between the
third party valuation and the Company’s estimated allocation.

NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of the valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired (See Note 5), representing license and banking infrastructure,
was completed. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value the
identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date. The straight-line method of amortization represents the Company’s best estimate of the
distribution of the economic value of the identifiable intangible assets. Furthermore, the Company is in the process of having a third-party valuation
firm conduct a valuation of the acquisition. As such, the Company’s valuation is preliminary and subject to change pending the results of the third-
party valuation report.
At September 30, 2021, intangible assets consisted of the following:

The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income tax assets for years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 because it is
not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry-forwards. The valuation allowance could be reduced or
eliminated based on future earnings and future estimates of taxable income.
As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $1,373,304 in U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in future periods to
reduce taxable income. However, due to changes in stock ownership, the use of the U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards is limited under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has not performed a study to determine if the loss carryforwards are subject to these
Section 382 limitations. $337,605 of the net operating loss carry-forwards will expire in fiscal years 2035 through 2038. The remaining net
operating loss carry-forwards do not expire. In addition, the Company has net operating losses in Malta totaling $503,647 with no expiration date.
As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not identify any uncertain tax positions that would require either recognition or disclosure in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in
other expense. However, no such interest and penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.
The Company has a December 31 tax year-end. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by
various tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed. The Company is not subject to income taxes in Bermuda. The Company’s 2018

NOTE 13 – CONTINGENCY
On April 16, 2020, the Company was named as a defendant in the Adversary Proceeding filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Massachusetts (Case No. 15-10745-FJB; Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01178) titled In re: BT Prime Ltd (“BT Prime”). The BT Prime Litigation
was brought by BT Prime against Boston Technologies Powered by Forexware LLC f/k/a Forexware LLC (“Forexware”), Currency Mountain
Holdings LLC, Currency Mountain Holdings Limited f/k/a Forexware Malta Holdings Ltd., FXDirectDealer, LLC, FXDD Malta Ltd., Nukkleus,
Nukkleus Bermuda Limited and Currency Mountain Holdings Bermuda, Ltd. BT Prime sought, amongst other relief, a determination that the
defendants were liable for all of the debts of BT Prime stemming from its bankruptcy proceedings, and sought to recover certain amounts
transferred to Forexware and FXDD Malta prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy case. In the sole claim asserted against Nukkleus, BT Prime
alleged that Nukkleus acquired certain technology assets from Forexware and is a continuation of the business of Forexware and a successor-in-
interest to Forexware. Based on this theory, BT Prime alleged that Nukkleus should be jointly and severally liable for any liability attributable to
Forexware or the other defendants, should the court eventually find any such liability. Although Nukkleus acquired licenses from Forexware,
Forexware retained other assets and continued to operate a separate business, which Nukkleus believes is the business that is pertinent to BT
Prime’s allegations. Nukkleus believes that the similarity in Forexware and Nukkleus’s business, including the shared use of software, caused BT
Prime to conflate the two businesses, but Nukkleus was not connected to the events that caused the initiation of BT Prime’s liquidation and
bankruptcy proceedings.
Nukkleus has issued a limited guarantee of the obligations under a settlement agreement among BT Prime and the defendants other than
Nukkleus, limited to an amount equal to $2,050,000, which guarantee is subject to release following payment by the defendants other than
Nukkleus of their obligations under the settlement agreement. Nukkleus management believes that the term of the limited guarantee will expire
without any payment obligation or other cost to Nukkleus. On May 31, 2022, the BT Prime Litigation was dismissed with prejudice by the
bankruptcy court as to Nukkleus and FXDD Malta Ltd.

such approval; and (viii) certain other conditions as set forth in the White Lion Agreement.
In addition to the shares to be issued under the White Lion Agreement, the Company will include in its registration statement additional shares of

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, who is the same person, has evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as
of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
On July 27, 2022, we reclassified the amortization of intangible assets from operating expenses to cost of revenue – financial services. We restated
our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended September 30, 2021 to reflect the reclassification, as
described in the Note 2 of this Amendment. The Company’s accounting related to reclassification of the amortization of intangible assets did not
have any effect on the Company’s previously reported consolidated operating loss, net loss or earnings per share, cash flows or balance sheets.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404(a). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As of September 30, 2021, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that, because of the Company’s small size and limited resources, its internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2021. We detected a weakness in our internal controls over financial
reporting related to accounting for non-routine or complex transactions. This internal control deficiency represents a material weakness.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended
September 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by our
independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only
management’s report.

Board of Directors
The minimum number of directors we are authorized to have is one and the maximum is six. In no event may we have less than one director.
Although we anticipate appointing additional directors in the future, as of the date hereof we have two directors.
Directors on our Board of Directors are elected for one-year terms and serve until the next annual security holders’ meeting or until their death,
resignation, retirement, removal, disqualification, or until a successor has been elected and qualified. All officers are appointed annually by the
Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board. Currently, each director receives annual compensation of $20,000 for their services on
our Board.
We reimburse our directors for expenses incurred in connection with attending directors’ meetings. We will consider applying for officers and
directors’ liability insurance at such time when we have the resources to do so.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Concurrent with having sufficient members and resources, our Board of Directors intends to establish an audit committee and a compensation
committee. The audit committee will review the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent auditors and review
and evaluate the system of internal controls. The compensation committee will review and recommend compensation arrangements for the officers
and employees. No final determination has yet been made as to the memberships of these committees or when we will have sufficient members to
establish committees. We believe that we will need a minimum of three independent directors to have effective committee systems.
As of the date hereof, we have not established any Board committees.
Family Relationships
No family relationship exists between any director, executive officer, or any person contemplated to become such.
Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of our
common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other of our equity
securities. During the year ended September 30, 2021, our officers, directors and 10% stockholders made the required filings pursuant to Section
16(a).
Possible Potential Conflicts
Our shares are quoted on OTC Pink which does not currently have any director independence requirements.
No member of management will be required by us to work on a full time basis. Accordingly, certain conflicts of interest may arise between us and
our officer(s) and director(s) in that they may have other business interests in the future to which they devote their attention, and they may be
expected to continue to do so although management time must also be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can
be resolved only through their exercise of such judgment as is consistent with each officer’s understanding of his/her fiduciary duties to us.
We cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective.
