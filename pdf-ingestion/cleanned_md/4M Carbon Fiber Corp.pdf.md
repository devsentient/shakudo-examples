Item 1. Business.
4M Carbon Fiber Corp., a Knoxville, Tennessee based carbon-fiber technology company
holds the exclusive rights to commercialize an atmospheric plasma oxidation process
that was co-developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories and 4XTechnologies LLC
(formerly RMX Technologies, LLC). The technology is patent protected until 2032, with
significant IP in the form of trade secrets (equipment designs and operational) and has
the potential to reduce the cost of carbon fiber through a combination of operating cost
reduction and fixed cost dilution (i.e. capacity increase). The Company also believes its
product will be superior in a number of aspects to fiber produced using current
processes.
The Company has partnered with both 4X Technologies LLC and C.A. Litzler & Co., Inc.,
a global leader in manufacturing carbon fiber production sub-systems, to design and
manufacture commercial-scale plasma oxidation ovens. 4M, 4XT and Litzler intend to
collaborate in the design and manufacture of plasma oxidation ovens for use by 4M. 4M
and 4XT will control manufacture of the plasma subsystems for integration into jointly
designed ovens. 4M is intending to exclusively build, own and operate carbon fiber
production lines leveraging the benefits of these commercial-scale plasma oxidation
ovens.

The Market and Plasma Oxidation Technology Benefits
The carbon fiber market is approximately $2 billion and expected to experience >10%
CAGR through 2025 according to Chris Red, Carbon Fiber 2017, with growing demand
from Industrial sectors including the auto industry, pressure vessels, infrastructure,
wind and others. Projections from the CompositesWorld Carbon Fiber 2016 Conference
in Arizona in November 2016 are that more than 100 new carbon fiber lines will be
required if there is no significant reduction in carbon fiber cost and the need may
drastically increase with a reduction in the cost of carbon fiber.
Research generated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory indicates that 4M’s plasma
oxidation technology is projected to reduce costs by more than $2 per pound of fiber
produced. Each modern carbon fiber line produces more than 3.0 million pounds per
year. That translates to $6 million per year in cost savings per production line.
Oxidation is a critical step in the production of carbon fibers. It plays a major role in
defining the final carbon fiber properties, but it takes the most time, consumes the most
energy, and is the greatest source of downtime.
4M Plasma Oxidation technology expands the operating window for carbon fiber
production, enabling faster oxidation of larger filaments, thereby increasing capacity
and establishing a new breed of larger carbon fiber filaments. In addition, shorter
residence times in oxidation will reduce fiber handling issues. Furthermore, in contrast
to conventional warm air oxidation, the Plasma ovens will facilitate greater thermal and
mechanical control throughout the oxidation process, permitting refinement of process
control unavailable to conventional carbon fiber lines.
Carbon fiber production is expected to be much more profitable as a result of the drastic
reduction in energy use and the time of oxidation primarily as a result of increased
throughput, reducing fixed costs per kilogram. In direct comparison, 4M's oxidation
ovens will require significantly less heated length than conventional technology, thus
requiring less fiber handling equipment, fewer personnel. These improvements will lead
to a significant reduction in gross air emissions for the same capacity. This technology
enables the production of up to three times as much product in the same operational
footprint resolving a significant barrier to meeting market growth targets using
traditional technology.
4M currently operates a small oxidation oven and has demonstrated the technology to
multiple carbon fiber production companies by successfully processing their precursor
materials. The oven has logged more than a thousand operating hours, proving
efficiency gains and fiber quality.
Commercialization Status
4M and 4XTechnologies will collaborate to implement commercial-scale plasma
oxidation ovens for 4M exclusive use. In March 2016, 4M, RMX (now 4XT) and CA
Litzler successfully partnered to manufacture a commercial-scale plasma oxidation oven
sub-section. Litzler is a global leader in manufacturing oxidation ovens and other carbon
fiber production systems. 4M will provide the plasma subsystems, while Litzler is
expected to supply the oven equipment.
4M has now assembled a team with carbon fiber experience and managerial leadership
led by CEO Rob Klawonn to position the Company for Investment and Operational
success. Furthermore, 2 independent board members were added in 2018 to guide the
company with strategic capital raising advise. 2019 will be used to take additional steps
in this new strategy towards commercial production of low-cost carbon fibers, including:
Retention of experienced carbon fiber design engineers and an experienced
composites engineer
Acquisition of a carbon fiber user (a composites materials entity)
Raising of capital to support the acquisition and product development line (PDL)
Preparing strategic plans and business models for an Initial Public Offering
Site Selection, including negotiation of State / Local Incentive Packages
Engineering and Procurement of a complete carbon fiber Product Development
Line using Plasma Oxidation
Start of Basic Engineering for Production Line 1

Intellectual Property
RMX Technologies, LLC (now 4XTechnologies LLC), jointly invented plasma oxidation
with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory over a multiyear period. This joint development
work was successfully concluded in 2015. That same year RMX created a subsidiary
company, 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC (4MIO) with the express purpose of
commercializing its plasma oxidation technology. In early 2016, RMX executed an
exclusive license agreement with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s management
company UT-Battelle, LLC (UTB). This UTB-RMX license agreement gave RMX the
exclusive worldwide rights to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and dispose of
plasma oxidation technology equipment and fiber produced by such equipment for the
life of the existing IP. In return, RMX pays UTB a royalty from revenue earned on
equipment and fiber sales and any related additional revenue.
RMX, in turn executed an exclusive license agreement with 4MIO on April 4, 2016,
giving 4MIO exclusive worldwide rights for plasma oxidation of polymeric fibers.
Pursuant to that certain Intellectual Property License Agreement, dated April 4, 2016,
as amended, between 4MIO and RMX, RMX granted 4MIO an exclusive license to use
the Licensed Patents in association with the development, production, marketing and
sale of products produced by 4MIO from the Licensed Patents (the “Licensed
Products”) throughout the world (the “Territory”). The term of the License Agreement
commenced on April 4, 2016 and expires on the expiration date of the last patent of the
Licensed Patents, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms thereto (the
“Term”). In consideration of the license, 4MIO is obligated to pay RMX a fee of
$150,000 (the “License Issue Fee”) on or before June 30, 2019. In addition to the
License Issue Fee, 4MIO has agreed to reimburse RMX for any underlying and/or
“upstream” license fees and/or royalties paid by RMX based on the plasma oxidation
Licensed Patents. Pursuant to the RMX-4MIO License Agreement, any Intellectual
Property discovered solely by either party during the Term shall be its property.
However, for any intellectual property developed by 4MIO or jointly developed by RMX
and 4MIO, RMX shall be granted a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use such
intellectual property in any legal manner determined by RMX to be appropriate. The
License Agreement may be terminated by the mutual agreement by the parties. In the
event 4MIO becomes insolvent, makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, is
subject to any bankruptcy or receivership proceedings, or fails to comply with any of its
obligations under the License Agreement, RMX may serve a Notice of Default to 4MIO.
If 4MIO fails to cure the default within 30 days of receipt of the Notice of Default, RMX
may then serve a Notice of Termination which case the License Agreement shall be
terminated and all of the Licensed Patents shall immediately revert to RMX.
In 2018, 4XT and 4M reached agreement to revise the license agreement to reflect the
strategic pivot and thus provide 4M and 4MIO with the exclusive rights to operate
carbon fiber production assets using the plasma oxidation technology.

Employees
4M has engaged various independent consultants and sales representatives, part-time
production and development personnel provided by 4XT with a total headcount available
of more than 20 full-time equivalent employees. As of December 31, 2018, 4M is
comprised of 6 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee.
Corporate History
The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware, on January 21, 2009 as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CornerWorld Corporation (“CWC”), a Nevada corporation
publicly traded on the OTCQB exchange.
The Company was setup as a holding company for three telecommunications services
subsidiaries. It recently disposed of these operations when it simultaneously entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 31, 2017 (the “Stock Purchase
Agreement”), with 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company
(“4MIO”), pursuant to which 4MIO purchased from the Selling Stockholders an
aggregate of 3,664,641 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“Common Stock”), of the Company, representing approximately 78.7% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. The foregoing sale of Common
Stock by the Selling Shareholders to 4MIO resulted in a change in control of the
Company.
6

Subsequently, on April 6, 2017, Woodland acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding membership interests of 4MIO which became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The acquisition had an effective date of April 1, 2017.
In early 2018, Woodland changed its name to 4M Carbon Fiber Corp (“4M”) and while
fully reporting to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), expects to complete the
process whereby it can begin trading on a public stock exchange in late 2019.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following are certain identifiable risk factors for our business operations.
We have substantial indebtedness. The amount of our outstanding indebtedness continues
to increase and our ability to make payments towards such indebtedness could have adverse
consequences on future operations.
Our outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2018 was $1,557,183, which was comprised of a
variety of short-term and long-term borrowings; convertible debentures; accounts payable; accrued
expenses and interest; and related party loans. The level of indebtedness we have affects our
operations in a number of ways. We will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay principal and
interest and meet payables commitments, which will reduce the amount of funds we will have
available to finance our operations. This lack of funds could limit our flexibility in planning for or
reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and could limit our ability to
make funds available for other purposes, such as inventory purchases, payroll, development or
acquisition activities. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total
indebtedness will depend upon our future performance. Our future performance, in turn, is
dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control such as general economic, financial and
business conditions. We cannot guarantee that our future performance will not be adversely affected
by such economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.
We are in the development stage and have limited operating history to evaluate our business
prospects.
The Company is in the development stage and faces all of the risks and uncertainties associated with a
new and unproven business. Our future is based on an unproven business plan with no historical facts
to support projections and assumptions. The Company’s business was founded in 2015 and the
Company has no operating history as an carbon fiber producer upon which investors can evaluate its
performance. The Company is not currently generating revenues and does not expect to generate
revenue until it locates customers interested in its technology. Investors should understand that an
investment in a start-up business is significantly riskier than an investment in a business with any
significant operating history. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever achieve revenues
or profitability. The Company’s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with
the formation of a pre-revenue business. Our lack of a significant and relevant operating history makes
it difficult to manage operations and predict future operating results.
Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our
operations could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results
of operations.
We may need to raise additional funds to achieve our future strategic objectives, and we may not be
able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional
equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests
and the value of shares of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be
required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain
specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we
need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other
things:
• develop and enhance our existing products and services;
• continue to expand our operations;
• hire, train and retain employees; or
• respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Our inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely
affect our results of operations.
7

Our success depends in part on the retention of our executive officers and key management,
and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.
Our success depends on the experience, performance and skills of our executive officers, senior
management and other key employees. Competition for skilled and experienced personnel is intense,
and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain qualified
personnel. Failure to attract, appropriately incentivize and retain qualified personnel could have an
adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning,
retention or hiring efforts will be successful. In addition, any or all of our key employees may decide to
leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control.
Our business particularly depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our officers
and directors: Robert Klawonn, CEO; Joshua M. Kimmel, President and Director; Rodney G. Grubb,
COO and Chairman; Erwin W. Vahlsing, Jr., CFO; Dr. Truman A. Bonds, CTO and Director; Douglas D.
Mentzer, Vice President Finance and Strategic Development and Director; Paresh M. Chari, Director,
and Garo Artinian, Director. We believe that the unique combination of skills and experience these
officers and directors possess would be difficult to replace, and their loss could have a material
adverse effect on us, including impairing our ability to execute our business strategy. Although we
have entered into written employment agreements with Robert Klawonn, Joshua M. Kimmel, Rodney
G. Grubb and Truman A. Bonds, and Douglas D. Mentzer, and a consulting agreement with Erwin
Vahlsing, Jr., the loss of any of them could have an adverse effect on our business.
We face competition from companies with far greater resources than we have. In addition,
methods of competition in the production of carbon fiber continues to change and evolve. If
we are unable to meet these changes, our business could be harmed.
We operate in a market sector that requires large capital investments and is highly competitive. The
principal methods of competition in the markets in which we compete are production capability,
quality and features of the end product, and price competitiveness. We compete in an international
market, and face a significant number of international competitors, some of which have far greater
resources than us. Among our principal competitors are Nestlé Waters North America, large regional
brands owned by private groups, and local competitors in the markets that we serve. Price reductions
and the introduction of new products by our competitors can adversely affect our revenues, gross
margins, and profits.
If we fail to meet certain commercialization milestones or otherwise default under our
license agreement with 4XT, we will lose our rights to the licensed intellectual property.
Pursuant to our license agreement with RMX, we assumed RMX’s obligations under its license
agreement with UT-Battelle, including, but not limited, achieving certain commercialization
milestones. In the event we do not meet such commercialization milestones or otherwise default the
agreement, our exclusive license to the Licensed Patents will terminate. Our loss to use the License
Patents will have a material adverse effect on our business and cause you to lose your investment in
our securities.
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If
we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to
accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential
shareholders could lose confidence in our financial statements, which would harm the
trading price of our Common Stock.
Companies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX 404”) SOX 404 requires management to establish and
maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting and annual reports on Form 10-K filed
under the Exchange Act to contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of a
company's internal control over financial reporting. Separately, under SOX 404, as amended by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, public companies that are large
accelerated filers or accelerated filers must include in their annual reports on Form 10-K an
attestation report of their regular auditors attesting to and reporting on management's assessment of
internal control over financial reporting. Non-accelerated filers and smaller reporting companies, like
us, are not required to include an attestation report of their auditors in annual reports.
A report of our management is included under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in this Form 10-K.
We are a smaller reporting company and, consequently, are not required to include an attestation
report of our auditor in our annual report. However, if and when we become subject to the auditor
attestation requirements under SOX 404, we can provide no assurance that we will receive a positive
attestation from our independent auditors.
During its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2018, management identified material weaknesses. These material weaknesses were associated
with (i) our lack of appropriate policies and procedures to evaluate the proper accounting and
disclosures of key documents and agreements and (ii) our lack of sufficient and skilled accounting
personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the
application
8

of GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. We are undertaking remedial
measures, which measures will take time to implement and test, to address these material
weaknesses. There can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to remedy the material
weaknesses identified or that additional material weaknesses or other control or significant
deficiencies will not be identified in the future. If we continue to experience material weaknesses in
our internal controls or fail to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, such
circumstances could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material
misstatements in our financial statements, or adversely affect the results of periodic management
evaluations and, if required, annual auditor attestation reports. Each of the foregoing results could
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our
stock price.
Moreover, if we identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls we
will have to implement appropriate changes to these controls, which may require specific compliance
training for our directors, officers and employees, require the hiring of additional finance, accounting,
legal and other personnel, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems and take
a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining
the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent
inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs
and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Effective internal controls are
necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result,
our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in us being subject
to regulatory action and a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, both
of which in turn could cause the market value of our Common Stock to decline.
A material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period because
of our Company’s exemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b)
of Sarbanes-Oxley.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was
not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s attestation in this Annual Report. As a
result, a material weakness in our internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period.
If we are unable to succeed in marketing, making sales and building our customer base to
support our business operations, we will be unable to achieve profitable operations, and our
business may fail.
If we are unable to succeed in marketing, making sales and building our customer base to support our
business operations, it could be detrimental to our profitability. Numerous factors beyond our control
may affect the marketability of the products offered. These factors include, but are not limited to,
shifting demand for varieties of carbon fiber, new or shifting product requirements, and emerging
competition. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but it is possible they
may result in our not receiving an adequate return on our invested capital.
Because we are dependent on third parties, should those services be interrupted or become
more costly, we may experience a material adverse effect on the acceptance of our brand and
on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
There is risk of change in the types of products being manufactured, and our ability to manufacture
the products required by our customers may be limited. Because we are dependent on precursor
materials manufactured by other suppliers, we face potential losses if any of these products are
interrupted or become more costly. Additionally, any failure on the part of these partners, upon whom
we may rely to supply us with products and services, will reflect poorly upon our brand, and therefore
result in reduced revenue.
If we are unable to successfully manage growth, our operations could be adversely affected.
Our progress is expected to require the full utilization of our management, financial and other
resources, which to date has operated with limited working capital. Our ability to manage growth
effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand operations, including our financial and
management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage production and sales personnel.
There can be no absolute assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively.
If we do not properly manage the growth of our business, we may experience significant strains on our
management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies and
industries grow quickly. If our business or industry grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer
demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development
delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our products. Our failure to properly manage the
growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our
operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and
results of operations, and our reputation with our current or potential customers.
9

If our products are found to cause injury, have defects, or fail to meet industry standards, we
will incur substantial litigation, judgment, product liability, and product recall costs, which
will increase our losses and negatively affect our brand name reputation and product sales.
Defects may be found in our products. Any such defects could cause us to incur significant return and
exchange costs, re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product
development efforts, and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems. Any
such defects could force us to undertake a product recall program, which could cause us to incur
significant expenses and could harm our reputation and that of our products. If we deliver products
with defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed.
Moreover, we may be subject to liability for any accidents or injury that may occur in connection with
the use of our products. We believe we are adequately insured in the event such claims are brought. If
we are unable to obtain such insurance, product liability claims could adversely affect our brand name
reputation, revenues and ultimately lead to losses. The occurrence of any claims, judgments, or
product recalls will negatively affect our brand name image and product sales, as well as lead to
additional costs.
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to develop and commercialize
our potential products without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
Our commercial success will depend, in part, on operating our business without infringing the patents
or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties that believe we are infringing on their rights could
bring actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin the development, marketing and
distribution of our products. If we become involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial
portion of our resources, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If any of these actions are
successful, we could be required to pay damages and/or to obtain a license to continue to develop or
market our products, in which case we may be required to pay substantial royalties. However, any
such license may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Ultimately, we could be
prevented from commercializing a product or forced to cease some aspect of our business operations
as a result of patent infringement claims, which would harm our business.
Because our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law limit the liability of our
officers, directors, and others, shareholders may have no recourse for acts performed in
good faith.
Under our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law, each of our officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, accountants and agents are not liable to us or the shareholders for any acts they
perform in good faith, or for any non-action or failure to act, except for acts of fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence. Our articles and bylaws provide that we will indemnify each of our
officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants and agents from any claim, loss, cost, damage
liability and expense by reason of any act undertaken or omitted to be undertaken by them, unless the
act performed or omitted to be performed constitutes fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence.
Legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it more difficult for us to
retain or attract officers and directors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate
accountability in connection with recent accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and
auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the
accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC,
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a public company, we are required to comply with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules
and regulations by the SEC that increase responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive
officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these recent changes may deter
qualified individuals from accepting these roles. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract
and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We continue to
evaluate and monitor developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the
amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.
Because the industry is dependent upon general economic conditions and uncertainties,
future developments could result in a material adverse effect on our business.
US trade & industry is subject to economic changes and periodical fluctuations. Prolonged declines in
the economy and/or a recession could have a material adverse effect on our business. The national
economy is affected by numerous factors and conditions, all of which are beyond our control, including
(a) Interest rates; (b) Inflation; (c) Employment levels; (d) Changes in disposable income; (e) Financing
availability; (f) Federal and state income tax policies; (g) tariffs and import/export fees; and (g)
Consumer confidence.

There is currently no public market for our common stock. Failure to develop or maintain a
trading market could negatively affect its value and make it difficult or impossible for you to
sell your shares.
There currently is no public market for our common stock as we have not been approved for trading
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (“FINRA”), and an active public market for our common
stock may not develop. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market could make it difficult
for you to sell your shares or recover any part of your investment in us should you decide to convert
some or all of your investment. Even if a market for our common stock does develop, the market price
of our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating to future
operating performance and the profitability of operations, factors such as variations in interim
financial results or various, as yet unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, may
have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.
Because the payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors, investors
may not realize cash dividends at the frequency or in the amounts they anticipate.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock. Our payment of any future
dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors,
including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and
the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. Distributions to our
stockholders are subordinate to the payment of our debts and obligations. If we have insufficient funds
to pay our debts and obligations, distributions to stockholders will be suspended pending the payment
of such debts and obligations. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own Common Stock
after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to recover their initial investment.
We are an “emerging growth company” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable
to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial
disclosure obligations, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously
approved. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we
are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon
the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in
annual revenue; the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity
securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion
in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary
of our initial public offering. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced
reporting burdens. If we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in future filings,
the information that we provide our security holders may be different than you might get from other
public companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our
common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our
common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common
stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, Delaware law and the convertible
notes may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the
change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult
for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These
provisions include:
our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion
of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents
stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;
stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of
Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting; such
provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of
proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control
of our company; and
11

our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of up to 25,000
currently undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred
stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other
rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware law anti-takeover
provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any
holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or,
among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors
could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. Additionally, certain provisions of
the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us or
could also have the effect of delaying or reducing the likelihood of a change in control of us even if
such acquisition or change of control may be favorable to our stockholders.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 2. Properties
Our principal executive office is located at 835 Innovation Drive, Suite 200, Knoxville, TN 37932. The
office is rented on a sublease basis from 4XTechnologies, LLC, which sublets only the portion of office
and workshop space that the Company utilizes. This rental rate is at the same price as 4XT pays the
landlord. Rental payments are current. We believe that our properties are adequate for our current
needs, but growth potential may require a separate, and larger facility due to anticipated addition of
production equipment and personnel. We do not have any policies regarding investments in real
estate, securities or other forms of property.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
The Company may, from time to time, become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings,
which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our
business. The Company is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings that it believes will have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or
operating results.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
Not applicable.

PART II
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
There is currently no public market for our Common Stock.
Holders of Our Common Stock
As of December 31, 2018, we had 78,273,588 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding,
held by 216 shareholders of record.
Dividends
There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring
dividends. The Delaware Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after
giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:
1. we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business,
or;
2. our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would
be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those
receiving the distribution.
We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable
future.
Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans
We do not have any equity compensation plans.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
All sales of unregistered securities during the year ended December 31, 2018 were previously
disclosed in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K except as follows:
At December 31, 2018, the Company recorded 36,667 shares of common stock to be
issued at a price of $0.60 per share, and 6,666 shares of common stock to be issued at a
price of $0.90 per share to our CFO in consideration of conversion of accounts payable
totaling $28,000 for services provided. The shares are to be issued in the second
quarter of 2019.
The above offers and sales of the securities were made only to “accredited investors,” as defined in
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, in reliance on the exemptions contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act, and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder, for transactions not
involving any public offering. No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the
securities. No underwriter participated in the offer and sale of these securities, and no commission or
other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly in connection therewith.
Item 6. Selected Financial Data
A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections,
statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the
assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements
generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”
“intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and
similar expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor
provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor provisions.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to
risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently
uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects
on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions,
legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally
accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating
forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We
undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information concerning our business,
including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in
our other filings with the SEC.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
Revenues
We generated revenues of $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with revenues of
$154,206 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect that over the coming year revenue will be
nominal and solely derived from testing of fiber production utilizing customer precursor materials,
more substantial revenue will be derived when our carbon fiber facility comes on line, and from
royalties earned from contracts with other manufacturers utilizing our patented technology once they
are signed.
Cost of Sales
Our cost of sales was $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with cost of sales of
$908,914 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The current years cost of sales decreased versus the
prior year as there were no further revenue generating tests for potential customers in 2018 leading
to development costs being expensed as part of general and administrative costs versus the prior year
where costs exceed revenue as a result of costs associated with development and testing activities as
the Company tested various techniques and configurations for specific customers. We therefore had a
gross loss of $-0- for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with a gross loss of $754,708
for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Operating Expenses
We incurred operating expenses of $4,486,034 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared
with $751,049 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our operating expenses increased primarily as
a result an increase of $793,650 in development costs, $795,674 in administrative payroll, associated
taxes and benefit costs, $97,689 for legal, accounting, and compliance costs connected with our public
reporting obligations, $46,667 in director fees, $422,166 in consulting expenses, and $1,367,155 in
employee and consultant stock grants.
We incurred other expenses of $55,101 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with
$45,707 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred interest expense of $60,366 for the year
ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $40,509 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, lead to our increased interest
expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $5,265 in interest income from the
short-term investment of cash in excess of current needs. During the year ended December 31, 2017,
we also charged to operations $5,198 as a loss from discontinued operations of Woodland Holdings,
prior to our acquisition.
Net Loss
We incurred a net loss of $4,541,135 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with a net
loss of $1,551,464 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
14

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2018, we had current assets of $1,621,392 and total assets of $2,238,426. As of
December 31, 2017, we had current assets of $1,460,139 and total assets of $2,143,750. The overall
increase in current assets is primarily due to increases in cash of $148188, and a net increase in fixed
assets of $3,039.
We had current liabilities of $1,555,390 and total liabilities of $1,575,390 as of December 31, 2018. As
of December 31, 2017, we had current liabilities of $1,114,328 and total liabilities of $1,204,328. The
increase in liabilities is primarily a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
$101,649, and accrued wages and director’s compensation of $384,760.
As such, we had a working capital surplus of $66,002 and $345,811 as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Cash Flow Analysis
Operating activities used $2,208,245 in cash for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
$1,159,933 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used was primarily
attributable to the operating loss of $4,541,135 offset by increases of $1,807,278 in common stock
issued for services, increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $486,409, and non-cash
depreciation and amortization of $69,616.
Investing activities used $3,039 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $196,487 for
the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018. The Company acquired various computers and software
in the amount of $3.039 versus the Company’s acquisition of a control block of shares in Woodland
Holdings Corp (now 4MCarbon Fiber) in exchange for $100,000 in cash and expended $96,487 on
computers for development purposes in the year ended December 31, 2017.
Financing activities provided $2,359,472 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to
$2,615,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2018, financing
consisted of $2,359,472 from the sale of common shares, versus the year ended December 31, 2017 in
which financing consisted of $2,135,000 from the sale of common shares, a $200,000 loan from a
related party, member contribution prior to the acquisition of $190,000 and proceeds from convertible
debentures of $90,000.
Convertible Debt
We issued a number of convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amounts of $ -0- and $90,000
during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These debentures are convertible
at the greater of (a) 80% of the market price on the date of conversion or $2.00 per share and are
more fully described in the footnotes to our audited financial statements.
1. On September 7, 2017, we borrowed $20,000 under the terms of a convertible promissory
note.
2. On September 13, 2017, we borrowed $20,000 under the terms of a convertible promissory
note.
3. On September 19, 2017, we borrowed $40,000 under the terms of a convertible promissory
note.
4. On September 22, 2017, we borrowed $10,000 under the terms of a convertible promissory
note.
As of December 31, 2018, all except one holder of the convertible debt had converted their notes into
common stock. The remaining balance of convertible notes at December 31, 2018 was $20,000.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of our Company as a going concern.
While the Company had limited revenues and continuing losses from operations as of December 31,
2018, we currently have a cash balance of approximately $1,450,000 which is expected to be adequate
for operations approximately seven to eight months during which time the Company expects to raise
sufficient funds. We are currently in the planning and development phase of establishing our
production facility with the goal of creating long term revenue generation within the next three years.
The Company is also targeting to raise capital towards an acquisition synergistic with the carbon fiber
business which would provide ongoing cash flow and revenue.
As our business develops, management anticipates that we will be dependent, for the near future, on
additional investment capital to fund growth and operating expenses. The Company is continuing its
efforts to raise additional funds through the capital markets.

Critical Accounting Policies
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices”
in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is
one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and
requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We do not believe that any
accounting policies currently fit this definition.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
The FASB has issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU
supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue
Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires
that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. This ASU is effective on January 1, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet determined
the effect of the adoption of this standard and it is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Share-Based Compensation: Modification Accounting.
In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or
conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification
accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award
changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This authoritative guidance will be applied
prospectively to awards modified following adoption and will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the
first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The impact of the adoption of this guidance
will depend on whether the Company has any share-based payment awards or makes any future
modifications of share-based payment awards.
Retirement Benefits.
In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires companies to present the
service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation
cost. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement
separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is
presented. The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of
fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is
only expected to result in reclassification of other components of net benefit costs outside of income
from operations and is not expected to have a significant impact on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated
financial statements as the Company does not have such a plan at this time.
Business Combinations.
In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the definition of a business to
help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset
groups or as businesses. The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The impact of the
adoption depends on the facts and circumstances of future acquisition or disposal transactions.
Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers.
In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires entities to recognize at the
transaction date the income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2019,
with early adoption permitted. 4M Carbon Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance
on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated financial statements.
16

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses classification of certain cash
receipts and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows. The authoritative guidance will be
effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance is not
expected to have a significant impact on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Compensation.
In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
4M Carbon Fiber adopted the authoritative guidance effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Upon
adoption, 4M Carbon Fiber elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine
the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. The new standard will result in the
recognition of excess tax benefits in provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital
prospectively, which is expected to increase volatility in 4M Carbon Fiber’s results of operations. 4M
Carbon Fiber will elect to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax
benefits retrospectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid
for withheld shares will be presented as a financing activity retrospectively, as required. 4M Carbon
Fiber expects cash flow from operations to increase, with a corresponding decrease in cash flow from
financing activity as a result of the changes in the cash flow presentation.
Leases.
In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires
lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements
that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced
disclosures. The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of
fiscal 2020 and should see 4M Carbon Fiber using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption
is permitted. 4M Carbon Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on 4M Carbon
Fiber’s consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement.
In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires equity investments that do not
result in consolidation, and are not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair
value, and requires recognition of any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments
qualify for a new practicability exception. For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the change in
fair value caused by a change in instrument-specific credit risk will be required to be presented
separately in other comprehensive income. The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon
Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted only for the provisions related to
the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities caused by instrument-specific credit risk.
4M Carbon Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on 4M Carbon Fiber’s
consolidated financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These
pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2018, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on the Company's revenue and operating results was not significant.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. & Subsidiary
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of 4M Carbon Fiber Corp. & Subsidiary (the “Company”) as
of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the related statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows
for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s ability to raise additional
capital through debt and/or equity financing to fund its operating costs is unknown, which raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

4M Carbon Fiber Corp. and Subsidiary
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
1. Organization and Nature of Operations
The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware, on January 21, 2009 as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of CornerWorld Corporation (“CWC”), a Nevada corporation publicly
traded on the OTCQB exchange.
The Company was setup as a holding company for three telecommunications services
subsidiaries. It recently disposed of these operations when it simultaneously entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 31, 2017 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”),
with 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company (“4MIO”),
pursuant to which 4MIO purchased from the Selling Stockholders an aggregate of
3,664,641 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of
the Company, representing approximately 78.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock of the Company. The foregoing sale of Common Stock by the Selling
Shareholders to 4MIO resulted in a change in control of the Company.
Subsequently, on April 6, 2017, Woodland acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding membership interests of 4MIO which became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The acquisition had an effective date of April 1, 2017.
In early 2018, Woodland changed its name to 4M Carbon Fiber Corp (“4M”) and while
fully reporting to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), expects to complete the
process whereby it can begin trading on a public stock exchange in late 2019.
2. Going Concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $5,563,994 as of December 31,
2018 and has incurred a net loss of $4,541,135 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from
normal business operations when they become due, and to generate profitable operations
in the future. Management plans to continue to provide for its capital requirements by
seeking long term financing which may be in the form of additional equity securities and
debt. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no
assurances that if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business
plan or generate positive operating results.
These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a) Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are
expressed in U.S. dollars. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31.
F-6

b) Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 4M carbon Fiber Corp.
(parent) and 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC., our wholly owned subsidiary which has
common ownership and management. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.
c) Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to
the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of
costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the
actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d) Cash and Cash Equivalents / Concentration of Credit Risk
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash includes demand deposits, saving
accounts and money market accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Cash is maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally
insured limits. We have never experienced any losses related to these balances. Certain
of our non-interest-bearing cash balances were at December 31, 2018 in excess of the
federally insured limits. The Company is working with the banks to distribute the excess
balances in such a way that no account balances will be in excess of federally insured
limits.
e) Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per
Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
(“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss
available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method
and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS,
the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares
assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

f) Financial Instruments
Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of
independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A
financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes
the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with
insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived
valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the
valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the
assets or liabilities.
The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value
of our cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other
financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and
respective maturity dates or durations.
g) Income Taxes
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization
is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 “Accounting for Income
Taxes” as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax
asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net
operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the
Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating
losses carried forward in future years.
h) Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC-605, “Revenue Recognition,”
which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or title has
passed; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably
assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments
regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the
collectability of those amounts.
Revenues are recognized upon shipment, provided that a signed purchase order has been
received, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is
reasonably assured, and there are no remaining significant obligations. Reserves for sales
returns and allowances, including allowances for so called “ship and debit” transactions,
are recorded at the time of shipment, based on historical levels of returns and discounts,
current economic trends and changes in customer demand. Certain transactions that are
prepaid at time of order, are recognized at the time the merchandise ships from the
facility to the customer.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and
other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The
Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject
to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product has been delivered or no refund will be required.
F-8

i) Accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk
Because the Company currently produces to order on a limited test basis, there is
typically a prepayment required, with the balance due within 30 days of delivery. The
Company looks closely at the credit worthiness of its customers and determines the
exposure it is willing to accept. Go forward, long-term contracts will be negotiated and
may lead to a concentration of credit risk due to the nature of those agreements, however,
currently our sales are limited and to diverse, top rated firms that are evaluating the
efficacy of our product. Our concentration risk will be reevaluated on a quarterly basis.
j) Allowance for doubtful accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the
collectability of customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. The
Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts through identification of specific receivables where it is expected that payments
will not be received. The Company also establishes an unallocated reserve that is applied
to all amounts that are not specifically identified. In determining specific receivables
where collections may not have been received, the Company reviews past due receivables
and gives consideration to prior collection history and changes in the customer’s overall
business condition. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s best
estimate as of the reporting dates.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had an allowance for bad debts in the
amount of $-0- and $-0- respectively.
k) Related Party Transactions
The Company considers all officers, directors, senior management personnel, and senior
level consultants to be related parties to the Company.
l) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The FASB has issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition
requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most
industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an
entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective on January 1,
2017 and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the
date of initial application. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption
of this standard and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Share-Based Compensation: Modification Accounting. In May 2017, the FASB issued
an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-
based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting
is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award
changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This authoritative guidance will
be applied prospectively to awards modified following adoption and will be effective for
4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The
impact of the adoption of this guidance will depend on whether the Company has any
share-based payment awards or makes any future modifications of share-based payment
awards.
Retirement Benefits. In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which
requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same
line items in which they report compensation cost. The other components of net benefit
cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately
F-9

from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one
is presented. The authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The
adoption of this guidance is only expected to result in possible reclassification of other
components of net benefit costs outside of income from operations and is not expected to
have a significant impact on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated financial statements as the
Company does not have such a plan at this time.
Business Combinations. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or
disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses. The
authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal
2019 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The impact of the adoption
depends on the facts and circumstances of future acquisition or disposal transactions.
Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers. In October 2016, the FASB issued
authoritative guidance that requires entities to recognize at the transaction date the
income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory. The
authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal
2019, with early adoption permitted. 4M Carbon Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of
this new guidance on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated financial statements.
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. In August 2016, the
FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses classification of certain cash receipts
and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows. The authoritative guidance will
be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this
guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on 4M Carbon Fiber’s consolidated
financial statements.
Share-Based Compensation. In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. 4M Carbon Fiber
adopted this authoritative guidance effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Upon
adoption, 4M Carbon Fiber elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur
to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. The new
standard will result in the recognition of excess tax benefits in provision for income taxes
rather than paid-in capital prospectively, which is expected to increase volatility in 4M
Carbon Fiber’s results of operations. 4M Carbon Fiber has elected to apply the
presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively.
The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld
shares will be presented as a financing activity retrospectively, as required. 4M Carbon
Fiber expects cash flow from operations to increase, with a corresponding decrease in
cash flow from financing activity as a result of the changes in the cash flow presentation.
Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting,
which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for
certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous
standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures. The authoritative guidance will be
effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and should see 4M Carbon
Fiber using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. 4M Carbon
Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on 4M Carbon Fiber’s
consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement. In January 2016, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance that requires equity investments that do not result in
consolidation, and are not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair
value, and requires recognition of any changes in fair value in net income unless the
investments qualify for a new practicability exception. For financial liabilities measured at
fair value, the change in fair value caused by a change in instrument-specific credit risk
will be required to be presented separately in other comprehensive income. The
authoritative guidance will be effective for 4M Carbon Fiber in the first quarter of fiscal
2019. Early adoption is permitted only for the provisions related to the recognition of
changes in fair value of financial liabilities caused by instrument-specific credit risk. 4M
Carbon Fiber is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on 4M Carbon Fiber’s
consolidated financial statements.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.
These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other
new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.
F-10

m) Inventory
Inventories are stated based on the First In First Out (FIFO) method, and consist of
finished goods produced in accordance with Company specifications, work-in-process as
such may exist from time to time at various supplier locations that may work with
Company supplied goods and materials, and raw materials that are purchased in
connection with upcoming production of goods.
n) Derivative Liabilities
The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of
December 31, 2018, which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the
Company’s common stock, and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for
liability classification under ASC 815.
ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate
conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing
derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not
clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract,
(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the
host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally
accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they
occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of
ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is
deemed to be conventional, as described.
o) Convertible Instruments
The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible
instruments in accordance with professional standards for “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”.
Professional standards generally provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to
bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free
standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in
which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument
are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host
contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative
instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise
applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in
earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the
embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is
deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of
“Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument”.
The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the
embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in
accordance with professional standards when “Accounting for Convertible Securities with
Beneficial Conversion Features,” as those professional standards pertain to “Certain
Convertible Instruments.” Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts
to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt
instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price
embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the
term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records
when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded
in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying
common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective
conversion price embedded in the note.
ASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the
entity’s control could or requires net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified
as an asset or a liability.

p) Long Lived Assets
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant
and Equipment (“ASC 360-10”). ASC 360-10 requires those long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Events relating to recoverability may include significant
unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to
achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates
the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows.
Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be
adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and
ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
q) Advertising
Advertising is expensed as incurred and is included in selling costs on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Advertising and marketing expense for the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $11,240 and $7,684, respectively.

6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and
liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such
as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10
establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or
unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In
certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the
fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value
hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Items recorded or measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements consisted of the following items as of
December 31, 2018:
Fair Value Measurements at

The debt and warrant derivative liabilities is measured at fair value using quoted market
prices and estimated volatility factors based on historical prices for the Company’s
common stock and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has no measurable derivative liabilities
connected with debt or warrants.
7. Prepaid Assets
In January 2016, the Company reclassified a Note Receivable of $150,000 due from RMX

10.Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2018 of $525,943 resulting from net
operating losses and future amortization deductions, have been fully offset by valuation
allowances. The valuation allowances have been established equal to the full amounts of
the deferred tax assets, as the Company is not assured that it is more likely than not that
these benefits will be realized.
Reconciliation between the statutory United States corporate income tax rate (21%) and
the effective income tax rates based on continuing operations is as follows:
Year ended December 31, 2018 2017
Income tax benefit at Federal statutory rate of 21% $ (558,600) $ (325,807)
State Income tax benefit, net of Federal effect (133,000) (77,575)
Permanent and other differences 309,277 -
Change in valuation allowance 382,323 403,380
Total$ - $ -
Components of deferred tax assets were approximately as follows:
As at December 31, 2018 2017
Net operating loss $ 1,217,545 $ 525,945
Asset impairment
Valuation allowance (1,217,545) (525,945)
Total$ - $ -
At December 31, 2018, the Company has available net operating losses of approximately
$4,682,864 which may be carried forward to apply against future taxable income. These
losses will begin to expire in 2032. Deferred tax assets related to these losses have not
been recorded due to uncertainty regarding their utilization.
The provisions of ASC 740 require companies to recognize in their financial statements
the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon
audit, based upon the technical merits of the position. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. ASC 740
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
Management does not believe that the Company has any material uncertain tax positions
requiring recognition or measurement in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740.
Accordingly, the adoption of these provisions of ASC 740 did not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s policy is to record interest and
penalties on uncertain tax positions, if any, as income tax expense.
The Company has not filed its applicable Federal and State tax returns for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The Company will file an extension for the 2018 filing.
F-21

The Company entered into a share exchange agreement during fiscal year 2017, as a
result, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the amount of future taxable
income that can be offset by pre-share exchange agreement net operating losses may be
limited. The deferred tax asset derived from these tax loss carry-forwards have been
included in consolidated deferred tax assets- net operating loss carry-forwards, and a full
valuation allowance has been established since it is not more likely than not that such
benefits will be recovered.
11.Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
The Company may, from time to time, become involved in various lawsuits and legal
proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may
arise from time to time that may harm our business. The Company is currently not
aware of any such legal proceedings that it believes will have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating
results.
Material Agreements
On August 1, 2015, 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC entered into a 2-year commercial
sub-lease with 4XTechologies (formerly Remaxco Technologies, LLC.) with 5 one-year
extensions. The lease covers office and manufacturing / test facility areas and carries
a monthly lease payment of $10,000. Currently, the lease has been extended through
July 31, 2019.
12.Acquisition of 4M Industrial Oxidation, LLC.
On April 6, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
April 6, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”) with an effective date of April 1, 2017, with
4MIO Merger Sub, LLC, a Tennessee limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”), and 4MIO, for the purposes of

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
In the Merger, the members of 4MIO exchanged their membership interests of 4MIO,
representing 100% of the outstanding membership interests of 4MIO, for an aggregate
of 55 million (55,000,000) shares of Common Stock of the Company which represented
approximately 78.46% of the shares of Common Stock of the Company based on an
aggregate of 70,096,470 shares of Common Stock outstanding upon consummation of
the Merger.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
ASSETS:
Current assets $ 319,983

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company’s management, with the participation of its chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2018. Based on
that evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of that date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, were not effective
simply due to the fact that the small size of the accounting department could not provide for
adequate segregation of duties typically established in larger reporting companies.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Section 13a-15(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s CEO and the Company’s CFO and
effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
conformity with U.S. GAAP and include those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and disposition of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.
42

As of December 31, 2018, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the criteria established by
COSO, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of December 31, 2018, as a result of the identification of the material
weakness described below.
A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.
The material weaknesses identified are:
Lack of full-time accounting staff resulting in a lack of segregation of duties and
accounting technical expertise necessary for an effective system of internal control.
Our Company does not have a full time Controller or Chief Financial Officer and
utilizes a part time consultant to perform these critical responsibilities;
lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the
Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
with respect to the requirements and application of GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements; and
ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.
Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on
the Company's financial results. However, management believes that the lack of outside
directors on the Company's board of directors can resulting in oversight in the establishing
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which can affect the process of
preparing Company's financial statements.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to
the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
management’s report in this Annual Report.
Management’s Remediation Plan
In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and
enhance our internal controls, if and when the Company obtains sufficient capital resources,
management intends to hire personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience
and to segregate appropriate duties among them. In March 2018, the Board appointed Paresh
Chari as a member to the Board. In July 2018, the Board appointed Garo Artinian as a
member of the Board. Both Mr. Chari and Mr. Artinian are deemed independent directors.
We also intend to appoint additional independent members to our Board of Directors who
shall also be appointed to a standing audit committee which will undertake the oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as
reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management. While we are
actively seeking outside members, including candidates with accounting experience, we
cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful. Given the size of our Company, lack
of revenues and current lack of financing to continue with our business, it is unlikely that we
will be able to hire any additional personnel or that anyone will agree to join our Board until
general economic conditions and our own business prospects improve significantly.
Management determined that a material weakness existed due to an inability to appropriately
segregate duties in the Company’s accounting department due to its small size. The
Company has included additional reviews to mitigate the size of the accounting department
and the overlap of responsibilities. The Company has also hired a seasoned executive to
oversee the general office operations of the Company, assist in the structuring of appropriate
procedures
43

and processes in spite of the limited resources. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire
additional accounting staff and implement additional procedures to further mitigate the
weaknesses discussed above. Additionally, the Company plans on hiring a fulltime Controller
or Chief Financial Officer when funds are sufficient.
Management also believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall
be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a
functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's
Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written
policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the
requirements and application of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and
(ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise
and knowledge will result in proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and
balances within the financial reporting department. Additional personnel will also provide the
cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the
financial reporting department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside
directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the Company may encounter
in the future.
Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls
and procedures and its internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are
committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. As the Company continues to evaluate and
work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to
take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the
remediation plan described above. We cannot assure you that, as circumstances change, any
additional material weakness will not be identified.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently
completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or
temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any
type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent
jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to
have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been
reversed, suspended or vacated.
Committees of the Board
Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or
committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating,
compensation or audit committee charter. Our directors believe that it is not necessary to
have such committees, at this time, because the functions of such committees can be
adequately performed by the board of directors.
Our company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders
to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board of directors believes that,
given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of
little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company
does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the
board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The board of directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by
management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.
A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing
a written request addressed to our CEO and director, Joshua Kimmel, at the address
appearing on the first page of this annual report.

The following table summarizes the annual compensation of our Named Executive Officers

The following provisions are the same in each employment agreement described above.
Term. The term of each Employment Agreement is from the Effective Date until the
third anniversary of the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”) and shall automatically
renew for successive one-year periods (each, an “Extended Term”), unless written
notice of non-renewal is given by either party to the other not less than 180 days prior
to the end of the Initial Term or any Extended Term. As used herein, “Term” shall
include the Initial Term and any Extended Term, but the Term shall end upon any
termination of the Employment Agreement with the Company as provided therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Change in Control (as defined in the
agreement) occurs during the Initial Term or any Extended Term, the Term shall be
extended until 18 months after the Change in Control.
Termination. The Employment Agreement may be terminated by the Company with
or without Cause (as defined therein) or by the Executive with or without Good Reason
(as defined therein).
50

Termination by the Company Without Cause or by the Executive with Good
Reason. During the Term, if the Executive’s employment is terminated by the
Company without Cause or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason,
then the Company shall pay the Executive any vested benefits the Executive may have
under any employee benefit plan of the Company through the date of termination,
which vested benefits shall be paid and/or provided in accordance with the terms of
such employee benefit plans (collectively, the “Accrued Benefit”). In addition,
subject to the Executive signing a separation agreement, the Company shall pay the
Executive an amount equal to one time the sum of (A) the Executive’s Base Salary plus
(B) the Executive’s Annual Cash Incentive Compensation (the “Severance Amount”).
Also, (i) all time-based equity awards (including any awards originally subject to
performance vesting conditions that remain subject to time-based vesting after
satisfaction of such performance conditions) held by the Executive in which the
Executive would have vested solely if he had remained employed for an additional 24
months following the Date of Termination shall vest and become exercisable or non-
forfeitable and (ii) all performance-based equity awards held by the Executive in which
the Executive would have vested had he remained employed through the end of the
performance period in respect of each such award shall become vested as of the end
of such performance period(s) based on the Company’s actual performance through
the end of such performance period(s) but such amount shall be further prorated in
the manner set forth in the applicable award agreement; and (iii) for a period of 18
months following the Date of Termination or until the Executive becomes covered
under a group health plan of another employer, whichever is earlier, subject to the
Executive’s continued copayment of premium amounts in amounts consistent with that
applicable to active employees, the Executive, the Executive’s spouse and dependents
shall continue to participate in the Company’s health insurance plan (medical, dental
and vision) upon the same terms and conditions in effect for other executives of the
Company; provided, however, that the continuation of health benefits under this
Subsection shall reduce and count against the rights of the Executive, the Executive’s
spouse and dependents under COBRA.
Change in Control Benefits. During the Term, if upon or within 18 months after a
Change in Control, the Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company without
Cause or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, then, subject to
the signing of the Separation Agreement and Release by the Executive and the
Separation Agreement and Release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the
Date of Termination, (i) the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum in cash in an
amount equal to 300% of the sum of (A) the Executive’s current Base Salary (or the
Executive’s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, if higher)
plus (B) the Executive’s Annual Cash Incentive Compensation; and (ii) all equity
awards held by the Executive shall immediately accelerate and become fully vested,
exercisable (if applicable) and nonforfeitable; and (iii) for a period of 18 months
following the Date of Termination or until the Executive becomes covered under a
group health plan of another employer, whichever is earlier, subject to the Executive’s
continued copayment of premium amounts in amounts consistent with that applicable
to active employees, the Executive, the Executive’s spouse and dependents shall
continue to participate in the Company’s health insurance plan (medical, dental and
vision) upon the same terms and conditions in effect for other executives of the
Company.
Change in Control. The term “Change in Control” shall mean any of the following:
(i) any “Person,” as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and in effect from time to time (the “Exchange
Act”) (other than the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any trustee, fiduciary or
other person or entity holding securities under any employee benefit plan or trust of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries), together with all “affiliates” and “associates”
(as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of such person,
shall become the “beneficial owner” (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 50%
or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities
having the right to vote in an election of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Voting
Securities”) (in such case other than as a result of an acquisition of securities directly
from the Company); or (ii) the consummation of a consolidation, merger or
consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company in a single transaction or series of related transactions (a “Corporate
Transaction”); excluding, however, a Corporate Transaction in which the
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction, would,
immediately after the Corporate Transaction, beneficially own (as such term is defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, shares representing in
the aggregate more than 50% of the voting shares of the corporation issuing cash or
securities in the Corporate Transaction (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any);
or (iii) persons who, as of the date hereof, constitute
51

the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Incumbent Directors”) cease for any reason,
including, without limitation, as a result of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or
similar transaction, to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any
person becoming a director of the Company subsequent to the date hereof shall be
considered an Incumbent Director if such person’s election was approved by or such
person was nominated for election by either (A) a vote of at least a majority of the
Incumbent Directors or (B) a vote of at least a majority of the Incumbent Directors
who are members of a nominating committee comprised, in the majority, of Incumbent
Directors; but provided further, that any such person whose initial assumption of
office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the
election of members of the Board of Directors or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board,
including by reason of agreement intended to avoid or settle any such actual or
threatened contest or solicitation, shall not be considered an Incumbent Director; or
(iv) any other acquisition of the business of the Company in which a majority of the
Board votes in favor of a decision that a Change in Control has occurred within the
meaning of this Agreement; or (v) the approval by the Company’s stockholders of any
plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a “Change in Control” shall not be deemed to have
occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause solely as the result of an acquisition of
securities by the Company that, by reducing the number of shares of Voting Securities
outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares of Voting Securities
beneficially owned by any person to 30% or more of the combined voting power of all
then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, that if any person referred to
in this sentence shall thereafter become the beneficial owner of any additional shares
of Voting Securities (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, or similar
transaction or as a result of an acquisition of securities directly from the Company)
and immediately thereafter beneficially owns 50% or more of the combined voting
power of all then outstanding Voting Securities, then a “Change in Control” shall be
deemed to have occurred for purposes of the foregoing clause.
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
There were no unexercised options, stock that has not vested, and equity incentive plan
awards for any officer or employee as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans
There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide retirement or similar benefits for
our directors or executive officers.
Resignation, Retirement, Other Termination, or Change in Control Arrangements
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could make it more
difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our
stockholders. These provisions include:
our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the
expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director,
which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of
Directors;
stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the
Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’
meeting; such provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from
conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and
our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of up to 25,000
currently undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred
stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting
or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire
us.
52

Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware law anti-takeover
provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination
with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for
three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our
Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
Additionally, certain provisions of the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more
expensive for a third party to acquire us or could also have the effect of delaying or reducing
the likelihood of a change in control of us even if such acquisition or change of control may be
favorable to our stockholders.
Other than disclosed under Employment Agreements above with Robert M. Klawonn, Joshua
M. Kimmel, Dr. Truman A. Bonds, Rodney G. Grubb, and Douglas Mentzer we have no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, whether written or unwritten, that provides for
payments to our directors or executive officers at, following, or in connection with the
resignation, retirement or other termination of our directors or executive officers, or a change
in control of our Company or a change in our directors’ or executive officers’ responsibilities
following a change in control.
Director Compensation
The Company has accrued compensation for the six directors who held office during the year
ended December 31, 2018. Each director was entitled to receive $10,000 per quarter, which
may be paid in cash, stock, or a combination thereof. At December 31, 2018, the accrual
totaled $366,367.
On March 28, 2018, Mr. Chari and the Company entered into a Director Agreement
(the “Director Agreement”) pursuant to which Mr. Chari agreed to serve as a member of
the Board of Directors in consideration for $10,000 per fiscal quarter, $5,000 (50%) of which
is payable in shares of Common Stock of the Company. Also, pursuant to the Director
Agreement, the Company granted Mr. Chari “tag-along rights” whereby that if at any time,
one or more stockholders of the Company who (together with their affiliates holding no less
than 51% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company) propose to sell any shares of
their Common Stock to an independent third party, Mr. Chari shall be permitted to
participate in such sale on the terms and conditions set forth in the Director Agreement.
Other than the foregoing, we have no formal plan for compensating our directors for their
services in their capacity as directors. Our directors are entitled to reimbursement for
reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at
meetings of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may award special remuneration
to any director undertaking any special services on our behalf other than services ordinarily
required of a director.

54

Changes in Control
We are not aware of any arrangements, including any pledge by any person of our securities,
the operation of which may result in a change in control of the Company.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons
who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities (each, a “Reporting
Person”) to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in
ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other
equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater
than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all
Section 16(a) reports that they file. Our executive officers and directors have not filed the
required Form 3s; however, there is currently no market for our Common Stock. Our
executive officers and directors either have or will file the required forms in the near future.
Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
SEC rules require us to disclose any transaction or currently proposed transaction in which
the Company is a participant and in which any related person has or will have a direct or
indirect material interest involving the lesser of $120,000 or one percent (1%) of the average
of the Company’s total assets as of the end of last two completed fiscal years. For purposes of
this Item, (i) “related person” means any executive officer, director, nominee for director, or
holder of 5% or more of the Company’s Common Stock, or an immediate family member of
any of those persons; and (ii) “transaction” includes, but is not limited to, any financial
transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of
indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships.
On April 4, 2018, Mr. Paresh M. Chari, a member of the Board of Directors of the
Company, invested $200,000 in the Company in exchange for 222,222 shares of
Common Stock and a warrant exercisable for 51,111 shares of Common Stock for
$0.90 per share from the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the date of
issuance. The warrant provides customary piggyback registration rights in the event
the Company proposes to register any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Form S-
1 or S-3. The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the warrant shall be adjusted in the event of stock splits, dividends or
reclassifications affecting the Common Stock of the Company or reorganizations,
merger or consolidation of the Company. The securities were issued in reliance on the
exemptions contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for transactions not
involving any public offering.
Director Independence
We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or
inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the Board of
Directors be “independent” and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our
Board of Directors comprised of a majority of “independent directors.” Other than Paresh
Chari, none of our officers qualify as independent due their executive officer status. The
Board has not determined if Mr. Chari qualifies as independent at this time.
