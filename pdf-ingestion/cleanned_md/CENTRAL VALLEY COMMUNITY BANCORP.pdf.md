PART I
ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General
Central Valley Community Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
“Company”). The Company was incorporated on February 7, 2000 as a California corporation, for the purpose of becoming the holding company for
Central Valley Community Bank (the “Bank”), formerly known as Clovis Community Bank, a California state chartered bank, through a corporate
reorganization. In the reorganization, the Bank became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the shareholders of the Bank became the
shareholders of the Company. The Company made a decision in the first half of 2002 to change the name of its one subsidiary, Clovis Community
Bank, to Central Valley Community Bank.
At December 31, 2019, the Bank was our only banking subsidiary. The Bank is a multi-community bank that offers a full range of
commercial banking services to small and medium size businesses, and their owners, managers and employees in the central valley area of
California. We serve nine contiguous counties in California’s central valley including Fresno County, El Dorado County, Madera County, Merced
County, Placer County, Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Tulare County, and their surrounding areas. We do not
currently conduct any operations other than through the Bank. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to
the Company and the Bank on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2019, we had consolidated total assets of approximately $1,596,755,000. See
Items 7 and 8, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Financial Statements.
Effective October 1, 2017, the Company and Folsom Lake Bank (FLB) completed a merger under which Folsom Lake Bank, with two full-
service offices, located in Folsom and Rancho Cordova (Sacramento County), merged with and into the Bank. Effective October 1, 2016, the
Company and Sierra Vista Bank (SVB) completed a merger under which Sierra Vista Bank, with three full-service offices, located in Folsom and
Fair Oaks (Sacramento County) and Cameron Park (El Dorado County), merged with and into the Bank.
The Company is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Bank is regulated by the California Department of
Business Oversight and its primary Federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
As of March 1, 2020, we had a total of 288 employees and 273 full time equivalent employees, including the employees of the Bank.
The Bank
The Bank was organized in 1979 and commenced business as a California state chartered bank in 1980. The deposits of the Bank are
insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.
The Bank operates 20 full-service banking offices in Cameron Park, Clovis, Exeter, Folsom, Fresno, Gold River, Kerman, Lodi, Madera,
Merced, Modesto, Oakhurst, Prather, Roseville, Sacramento, Stockton, and Visalia. The Bank conducts a commercial banking business, which
includes accepting demand, savings and time deposits and making commercial, real estate and consumer loans. It also provides domestic and
international wire transfer services and provides safe deposit boxes and other customary banking services. The Bank also offers Internet banking.
Internet banking consists of inquiry, account status, bill paying, account transfers, and cash management. The Bank does not offer trust services or
international banking services and does not currently plan to do so in the near future. The Bank has a Real Estate Division, an Agribusiness Center,
and an SBA Lending Division in Fresno. The Real Estate Division processes or assists in processing the majority of the Bank’s real estate related
transactions, including interim construction loans for single family residences and commercial buildings. We offer permanent single family
residential loans through our mortgage broker services. Our total market share of deposits in Fresno, Madera, San Joaquin, and Tulare counties
was 3.31% in 2019 compared to 3.42% in 2018 based on FDIC deposit market share information published as of June 30, 2019. Our total market
share in the other counties we operate in (El Dorado, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, and Stanislaus), was less than 1.00% in 2019 and 2018. We have
a diversified loan portfolio. At December 31, 2019, we had total loans of $943,380,000. Total commercial and industrial loans outstanding were
$102,541,000, total agricultural land and production loans outstanding were $23,159,000, total real estate construction and other land loans
outstanding were $73,718,000; total other real estate loans outstanding were $634,824,000, total equity loans and lines of credit were $64,841,000
and total consumer installment loans outstanding were $42,782,000. Our loans are collateralized by real estate, listed securities, savings and time
deposits, automobiles, inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment.
In addition to acquisitions, we have experienced organic growth by expanding our branch network. Opening new branches provides us with
opportunities to expand our loan and deposit base; however, based on past experience, management expects these new offices may initially have a
negative impact on earnings until the volume of business grows to cover fixed overhead expenses. Management of the Bank analyzes its branch
network on an ongoing basis to determine whether to open new branches or consolidate or eliminate existing branches in the future. In 2019, we
consolidated two banking offices into
3

Table of Contents
branches currently serving the same communities - one in Fair Oaks and one in Rancho Cordova. The Bank opened a full-service branch in Gold
River, California in June 2019. In 2018, we consolidated two banking offices into branches currently serving the same communities - one in Visalia
and one in Folsom. The Bank also closed its Tracy banking office and sold the majority of the customer deposits in that office to another financial
institution.
Since August of 1995 the Bank had been a party to an agreement with Investment Centers of America, pursuant to which Investment
Centers of America provides Bank customers with access to investment services. In November 2017, the Bank ended its relationship with
Investment Centers of America and entered into an agreement with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. to provide Bank customers with access
to investment services.
No individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank’s assets or deposits, or in relation to our
overall business. Our deposits are attracted from individual and commercial customers. A material portion of our deposits have not been obtained
from a single person or a few persons, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on our business. However, at
December 31, 2019 approximately 82.0% of our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of loans secured by real estate, including construction
loans, equity loans and lines of credit and commercial loans secured by real estate and 13.5% consisted of commercial loans. See Item 7 —
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Currently, our business activities are primarily
concentrated in Fresno, El Dorado, Madera, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare Counties in California.
Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general economic trends in our market area and, in
particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. Further, our concentration of operations in this area of California exposes us to
greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base.
Competition
The banking business in California generally, and our primary service area specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and
deposits, and is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the
advantages such major banks have over us is their ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets,
including loans, to regions of higher yield and demand. Major banks offer certain services such as international banking and trust services which
we do not offer directly but which we usually can offer indirectly through correspondent institutions. To compete effectively, we rely substantially
on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors and employees, referrals by our shareholders, personalized service and
our reputation in the communities we serve.
Our total market share of deposits in Fresno, Madera, San Joaquin, and Tulare counties was 3.31% in 2019 compared to 3.42% in 2018
based on FDIC deposit market share information published as of June 2019. In Fresno and Madera Counties, in addition to our 10 full-service
branch locations serving the Bank’s primary service areas, as of June 30, 2019 there were 132 operating banking and credit union offices in our
primary service area, which consists of the cities of Clovis, Fresno, Kerman, Oakhurst, Madera, and Prather, California. Prather does not contain
any banking offices other than our office. In San Joaquin County, in addition to our two full service branch locations, as of June 30, 2019 there were
99 operating banking and credit union offices. In Tulare County, in addition to our three branches there were 52 operating banking and credit
union offices in our primary service area. Our total market share in the other counties we operate in (El Dorado, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, and
Stanislaus), was less than 1.00% in 2019 and 2018. In Merced County, in addition to our one branch, as of June 30, 2019 there were 28 operating
banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Sacramento County, in addition to our two branches, as of June 30, 2019 there were
210 operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Stanislaus County, in addition to our one branch, there were 85
operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In El Dorado County, in addition to our one branch, there were 40 operating
banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Placer County, in addition to our one branch, there were 93 operating banking and
credit union offices in our primary service area. Business activity in our primary service area is oriented toward light industry, small business and
agriculture.
By virtue of their greater total capitalization, larger banks have substantially higher lending limits than we do. Legal lending limits to an
individual customer are limited to a percentage of our total capital. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank’s legal lending limits to individual
customers were $27,069,000 for unsecured loans and $45,116,000 for unsecured and secured loans combined.
For borrowers desiring loans in excess of the Bank’s lending limits, the Bank seeks to make such loans on a participation basis with other
financial institutions. Banks also compete with money market funds and other money market instruments, which are not subject to interest rate
ceilings. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale
finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal finance software. Competition for
deposit and loan products remains strong, from both banking and non-banking firms, and affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on
which they are offered to customers.

Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets.
Technological innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services
that previously have been traditional banking products. In addition, customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels,
including telephone, mail, home computer, ATMs, remote deposit, mobile banking applications, self-service branches, and in-store branches.
Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and
increase revenues to remain competitive. In addition, competition has intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws, which permit
banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in the past. Such laws allow banks to merge with other banks across
state lines, thereby enabling banks to establish or expand banking operations in our market. The competitive environment also is significantly
impacted by federal and state legislation, which may make it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with us.
Supervision and Regulation
GENERAL
Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Regulation and supervision by federal and state banking agencies are intended to maintain
a safe and sound banking system, protect depositors and the FDIC’s insurance fund, and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In
furtherance of these goals, Congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that
govern banks, bank holding companies and the financial services industry. Consequently, the growth and earnings performance of the Company
can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal
statutes, regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, FDIC, the California
Department of Business Oversight (“DBO”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the
Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the FASB, securities laws administered by the SEC and state
securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, and mortgage related rules,
including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, also impact our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our
financial condition and results of operations. Further, the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial
institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of banks, their
holding companies and their affiliates. These laws are intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and bank
customers rather than shareholders. Federal and state laws, and the related regulations of the bank regulatory agencies, affect, among other
things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations,
the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire other financial
institutions, dealings with insiders and affiliates, and the payment of dividends.
This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective
regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can affect the conduct and growth of their
businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk,
management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose
restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are
unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of
these agencies.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and its bank
subsidiary. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those
that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION
The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”),
and is subject to the supervision and examination of the Federal Reserve. Pursuant to the BHC Act, we are required to obtain the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve before we may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if,
after giving effect to such acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of such bank.
5

Table of Contents
Under the BHC Act, we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiaries
that the Federal Reserve deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. Bank holding companies that qualify and
elect to be treated as “financial holding companies” may engage in a broad range of additional activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental
to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository
institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making
merchant banking investments. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company and currently have no plans to make a financial
holding company election.
We are also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the
voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the Federal Reserve determines that the activity is so closely
related to banking to be a proper incident to banking. The Federal Reserve’s approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can
be acquired and, in certain cases, before any approved company can open new offices.
The BHC Act and the Federal Reserve regulations also impose certain constraints on the redemption or purchase by a bank holding
company of its own shares of stock.
Our earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by actions of regulators, and by local legislative and administrative bodies and
decisions of courts in the jurisdictions, in which both the Company and the Bank conduct business. For example, these include limitations on the
ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders. It is the policy of the
Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only
if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank
holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of
strength to its banking subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to
their holding companies without regulatory approval. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to
prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the
circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
In addition, banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their
holding companies and other affiliates. Transactions between affiliates are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulation
W codifies interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Federal Reserve Act and
Regulation W, a bank can make a loan or extend credit to an affiliate, purchase or invest in the securities of an affiliate, purchase assets from an
affiliate, accept securities of an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, issue a guarantee, or
accept letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate only if the aggregate amount of the above transactions of such subsidiary does not exceed 10
percent of such subsidiary’s capital stock and surplus on a per affiliate basis or 20 percent of such subsidiary’s capital stock and surplus on an
aggregate affiliate basis. Such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and on
terms that are not more favorable than those provided to a non-affiliate. A bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase a “low-quality
asset,” as that term is defined in the Federal Reserve Act, from an affiliate. Such restrictions also generally prevent a holding company and its
other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the holding company unless the loans are secured by collateral.
A holding company and its banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any
extension of credit, sale or lease of property or provision of services. For example, with certain exceptions a bank may not condition an extension
of credit on a customer obtaining other services provided by it, a holding company or any of its other bank affiliates, or on a promise by the
customer not to obtain other services from a competitor.
The Federal Reserve has cease and desist powers over parent bank holding companies and non-banking subsidiaries where actions of a
parent bank holding company or its non-financial institution subsidiaries represent an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law. The Federal
Reserve has the authority to regulate debt obligations (other than commercial paper) issued by bank holding companies by imposing interest
ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations.
We are also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. As such, we and our subsidiaries
are subject to examination by the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO).
Further, we are required by the Federal Reserve to maintain certain capital levels. See “Capital Standards.”
REGULATION OF THE BANK
Banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank, is subject to primary
supervision, regulation and periodic examination by the DBO and the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, but is
nevertheless subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations.
If, as a result of an examination of a bank, the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings
prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the
6

Table of Contents
Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the FDIC. Such remedies include the
power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to
issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict the growth of the Bank, to assess civil
monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors, and ultimately to terminate the Bank’s deposit insurance, which for a California chartered
bank would result in a revocation of the Bank’s charter. The DBO has many of the same remedial powers.
The Bank is a member of the FDIC, which currently insures customer deposits in each member bank to a maximum of $250,000 per
depositor. For this protection, the Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and, as is the case with all insured banks, may be
required to pay a semi-annual statutory assessment. All of a depositor’s accounts at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest
bearing transactions accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 for each deposit
insurance ownership category.
Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the State of California and the United States affect the operations of the Bank. State
and federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank’s operations, including standards for safety and soundness, reserves
against deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch
offices, fair lending requirements, Community Reinvestment Act activities, and loans to affiliates.
Depositor Preference. In the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the
institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a
receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and
uninsured depositors along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors including the parent bank
holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately
capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on
the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. The Bank
is eligible to accept brokered deposits without limitations.
Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders. The authority of the Bank to extend credit to its directors, executive
officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members and corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to
substantial restrictions and requirements under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder, as
well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to
directors and other insiders, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts. In addition, all loans
the Bank makes to directors and other insiders must satisfy the following requirements:
• the loans must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Bank;
• the Bank must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with
persons who are not affiliated with the Bank; and
• the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of non-payment or include other features not favorable to the Bank.
Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators, and these loans are
closely scrutinized by the regulators for compliance with Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. Each loan to
directors or other insiders must be pre-approved by the Bank’s board of directors with the interested director abstaining from voting.
PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS
THE COMPANY
Our shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to
the dividends preference, if any, on preferred shares that may be outstanding. The principal source of cash revenue to the Company is dividends
received from the Bank. The Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to the Company is subject to state and federal regulatory restrictions.
The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by both general corporate law considerations and the policies of the
Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank
holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to
shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; or (ii) the
prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial
condition. If the
7

Table of Contents
Company fails to adhere to these policies, the Federal Reserve could find that the Company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. See
“Supervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements” below.
Subject to exceptions for well-capitalized and well-managed holding companies, Federal Reserve regulations also require approval of
holding company purchases and redemptions of its securities if the gross consideration paid exceeds 10 percent of consolidated net worth for any
12-month period. In addition, Federal Reserve policy requires that bank holding companies consult with and inform the Federal Reserve in advance
of (i) redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments when experiencing financial weakness and (ii) redeeming or repurchasing common stock and
perpetual preferred stock if the result will be a net reduction in the amount of such capital instruments outstanding for the quarter in which the
reduction occurs.
As a California corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of California law, which allows a corporation to distribute cash or
property to shareholders, including a dividend or repurchase or redemption of shares, if the corporation meets either a retained earnings test or a
“balance sheet” test. Under the retained earnings test, the Company may make a distribution from retained earnings to the extent that its retained
earnings exceed the sum of (i) the amount of the distribution plus (ii) the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential
dividend rights. The Company may also make a distribution if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum
of (a) its total liabilities plus (b) the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders
receiving the distribution. Indebtedness is not considered a liability if the terms of such indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest
thereon are to be made only if, and to the extent that, a distribution to shareholders could be made under the balance sheet test. In addition, the
Company may not make distributions if it is, or as a result of the distribution would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose
payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature.
THE BANK
Dividends payable by the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank’s retained earnings, or the
Bank’s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends paid during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the
retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year.
In addition to the regulations concerning minimum uniform capital adequacy requirements described below, the FDIC has established
guidelines regarding the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses. Therefore, the future payment of cash dividends by the Bank will
generally depend, in addition to regulatory constraints, upon the Bank’s earnings during any fiscal period, the assessment of the Board of Directors
of the capital requirements of the Bank and other factors, including the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses.
REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that
reflects the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations, both for transactions reported on the balance sheet as
assets and for transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, that are recorded as off-balance sheet items. In 2013, the bank
regulatory agencies issued final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking
organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital
standards and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Dodd-Frank”). The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015.
The Basel III Capital Rules require the Bank to comply with several minimum capital standards. The Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of at least 4.0%; a common equity Tier 1, which we refer to as CET1, to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%; a Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus
Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0% and a total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted
assets of at least 8.0%. CET1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined
as CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related
surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (CET1 capital plus Additional
Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may
include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and
subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan loss limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. We
exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) in part to avoid significant variations
in our capital levels resulting from changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as interest rates fluctuate.
Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into CET1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-
for-sale-securities). The calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement
that (i) mortgage servicing rights, (ii) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that
8

Table of Contents
could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and (iii) significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from
CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of
the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and would be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on
January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter).
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules limit capital distributions and certain
discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of an additional 2.5% of
CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic
stress. The capital conservation buffer requirement was being phased in over a four-year period beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625%,
increasing by 0.625% each January 1 until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
On Aug. 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule, “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company
Policy Statement and Related Regulations; Changes to Reporting Requirements,” as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and
Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”). The rule expands the applicability of its small-bank holding company policy statement from $1 billion to $3
billion total consolidated assets. The policy statement exempts holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that meet
certain qualitative requirements from consolidated capital requirements.
In 2018, banking organizations were required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.375%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.875%,
and a total capital ratio of at least 9.875% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments.
As phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Bank is required to meet minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a minimum CET1 to risk-weighted assets of
4.5% (7% with the capital conservation buffer), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% (8.5% including the capital conservation buffer) and
a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0% (10.5% including the capital conservation buffer).
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain off-
balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the
regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. As a result, higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to
present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally
assigned to prudently underwritten first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans,
a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests,
depending on certain specified factors. The Basel III Capital Rules increased the risk weights for a variety of asset classes, including certain
commercial real estate mortgages. Additional aspects of the Basel III Capital Rules’ risk weighting requirements that are relevant to the Bank
include:
• assigning exposures secured by single-family residential properties to either a 50% risk weight for first-lien mortgages that meet
prudent underwriting standards or a 100% risk weight category for all other mortgages;
• providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less
that is not unconditionally cancellable (increased from 0% under the previous risk-based capital rules);
• assigning a 150% risk weight to all exposures that are nonaccrual or 90 days or more past due (increased from 100% under the
previous risk-based capital rules), except for those secured by single-family residential properties, which will be assigned a 100% risk
weight, consistent with the Basel I risk-based capital rules;
• applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility CRE acquisition, development and construction
loans; and
• applying a 250% risk weight to the portion of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences
that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks that are not deducted from CET1 capital (increased from 100%
under the previous Basel I risk-based capital rules).
As of December 31, 2019, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the
federal banking agencies for “well capitalized” institutions under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis.
On September 17, 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing Section 201 of the EGRRCPA that provides
for an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy. The final rule provides certain community banking organizations the ability to opt into a
new community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) intended to simplify regulatory capital requirements. Under the final rule, community banking
organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets may elect the new community banking leverage framework if they have a CBLR
of greater than 9 percent, and hold 25 percent or less of assets in off-balance sheet exposures and 5 percent or less of assets in trading assets and
liabilities. The CBLR is determined by dividing a banking organization’s tangible equity capital by its average total consolidated assets. Upon opt
into the community banking leverage framework, a qualifying community banking organization would not be subject to other risk-based and capital
leverage requirements (including the Basel III and Basel IV requirements) and would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio
requirements. Opting into the community banking leverage framework could greatly ease
9

the process of determining the Company and the Bank’s capital requirements starting on January 1, 2020, when the final rule became effective.
BANK SECRECY ACT/ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS
The Financial Recordkeeping and Reporting of Currency and Foreign Transactions Act of 1970 is commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy
Act (“BSA”), which has been frequently updated. The purpose of BSA is to require financial institutions to maintain certain records and file certain
reports that have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax and regulatory investigations or proceedings and to implement an anti-money
laundering program. BSA was amended under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001. Financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and
account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and identifying customers when establishing new relationships and standards in their
dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. The Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) final
rule, which was effective in 2018, also amended the BSA regulation. The CDD rule aims to improve financial transparency and prevent criminals
and terrorists from misusing companies to disguise their illicit activities and launder their ill-gotten gains. The Bank has extensive controls in place
to comply with these requirements.
OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) , is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department. It
administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries
and regimes. The OFAC regulations require financial institutions to block or reject payments, transfers, withdrawals or other dealings with respect
to accounts and assets of countries that are identified by the president as being a threat to national security. This may also include dealings with
accounts and assets of nationals of a sanctioned country and with other specially designated individuals (such as designated narcotics traffickers).
Financial institutions are also required to report all blocked transactions to OFAC within 10 business days of the occurrence. The Bank has
extensive controls in place to comply with these requirements.
.
PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY
The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) imposes requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy and
disclosure of non-public personal information. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to most nonaffiliated third parties
unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. In addition, the California Financial
Information Privacy Act (“CFIPA”) also requires a financial institution to provide specific information to a consumer related to the sharing of that
consumer’s nonpublic personal information. The CFIPA allows a consumer to direct the financial institution not to share his or her nonpublic
personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated companies with which a financial institution has contracted to provide financial products and
services, and requires that permission from each such consumer be acquired by a financial institution prior to sharing such information. Financial
institutions are required to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-
affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions must provide explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the
disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information. The Bank has
implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions which are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank.
The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. These
guidelines require financial institutions to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to
ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of
such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to
any customer. The Bank has adopted a customer information security program to comply with such requirements.
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several
states, including California where we conduct substantially all our banking business, have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring certain
financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data
encryption requirements. Many such states (including California) have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and
data privacy requirements. We continue to monitor relevant legislative and regulatory developments in California where nearly all our customers
are located and evaluate their impact on the Bank.

In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store
sensitive data. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as
to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the
foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking,
mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) is intended to encourage insured depository institutions, while operating safely and soundly, to
help meet the credit needs of their communities. The CRA specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository
institutions, to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community, including low-and moderate-income
neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution’s record of
meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, consummating mergers
or acquisitions or holding company formations. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank’s compliance with its
CRA obligations on a performance based evaluation system. This system bases CRA ratings on an institution’s actual lending service and
investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach or complies
with other procedural requirements. The ratings range from “outstanding” to a low of “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank had a CRA rating of
“satisfactory” as of its most recent regulatory examination.
CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS
The bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing
regulations. Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully
compliance with such laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, some of which are
discussed below.
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business
purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good
faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare
credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and
payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among
other things.
The Fair Housing Act (FHA) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related
lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending
practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FHA, including some that are not specifically mentioned in
the FHA itself.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods. It seeks to
provide public information showing whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in
which they are located. HMDA also includes a “fair lending” aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and
borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes.
Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature
and cost of real estate settlements. RESPA also prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of
escrow accounts. Penalties under the above laws may include fines, reimbursements and other civil money penalties.
Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the consumer protection laws, the Bank may incur additional compliance
costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community.
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU
Dodd-Frank created a new, independent federal agency, the CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement
powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track
consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Although all
institutions are subject to rules adopted by the CFPB and examination by the CFPB in conjunction with examinations by the institution’s primary
federal regulator, the CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. The FDIC has
primary responsibility for examination of the Bank and enforcement with respect to federal consumer protection laws so long as the
11

Table of Contents
Bank has total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, and state authorities are responsible for monitoring our compliance with all state
consumer laws. The CFPB also has the authority to require reports from institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, to
support the CFPB in implementing federal consumer protection laws, supporting examination activities, and assessing and detecting risks to
consumers and financial markets.
The consumer protection provisions of Dodd-Frank and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing
regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The CFPB has significant
authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts
and practices. The review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the CFPB, and of banking regulators
more broadly. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and
procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and
possible penalties. In addition, Dodd-Frank provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various
consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal
violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The
CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. Dodd-Frank does not prevent
states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
DEPOSIT INSURANCE
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits up to prescribed statutory limits of federally insured banks and savings
institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures the Bank’s customer deposits through
the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) up to prescribed limits for each depositor. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the maximum deposit insurance amount
was increased to $250,000. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as
measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a revised restoration plan to
ensure that the DIF’s designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) reaches 1.35% of insured deposits by September 30, 2020, the deadline mandated by Dodd-
Frank. However, financial institutions like the Bank with assets of less than $10 billion are exempted from the cost of this increase. The restoration
plan proposed an increase in the DRR to 2% of estimated insured deposits as a long-term goal for the fund. The FDIC also proposed future
assessment rate reductions in lieu of dividends when the DRR reaches 1.5% or greater. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reached 1.36%. Because
the reserve ratio has exceeded 1.35%, two deposit insurance assessment changes occurred under the FDIC regulations: 1) surcharges on large
banks (total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more) ended, with the last surcharge on large banks being collected on December 28, 2018, and 2)
small banks (total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion) were awarded assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that
contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. In September 2019, the
FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had reached 1.38%, triggering the distribution of assessment credits for community banks with assets
under $10 billion. The DIF credits are being applied each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.35%.
We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or
financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently
increased levels. These announced increases and any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our
earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of or market for our common stock.
The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or
unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the
bank’s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank’s charter by the DBO.
OTHER PENDING AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION
Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the Company and the Bank and the banking industry in general may be
proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future. Such proposals,
if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject the Company or
the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new
rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or
regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Company or the Bank would be affected thereby.
12

Table of Contents
Many aspects of Dodd-Frank are subject to continued rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the
overall financial impact on us. Although the reforms primarily target systemically important financial service providers, Dodd-Frank’s influence has
and is expected to continue to filter down in varying degrees to smaller institutions over time. In May 2018, EGRRCPA repealed or modified certain
provisions of Dodd-Frank and provided regulatory relief for certain smaller financial institutions. We will continue to evaluate the effect of Dodd-
Frank as it may be amended from time to time. In many respects, however, the ultimate impact of Dodd-Frank will not be fully known for years, and
no current assurance may be given that Dodd-Frank, or any other new legislative changes, will not have a negative impact on the results of
operations and financial condition of the Company and the Bank.

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that
management believes may affect our business are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully
consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference
in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business. Additional risks and
uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our
business operations. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.
If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your
investment.
Worsening economic conditions could adversely affect our business.
The Bank conducts banking operation principally in California’s Central Valley. The Central Valley is largely dependent on agriculture. The
agricultural economy in the Central Valley is therefore important to our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows. We are also
dependent in a large part upon the business activity, population growth, income levels and real estate activity in this market area. A downturn in
agriculture and the agricultural related businesses could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The agricultural industry has been affected by declines in prices and changes in yields of various crops and other agricultural commodities. Weaker
prices could reduce the cash flows generated by farms and the value of agricultural land in our local markets and thereby increase the risk of
default by our borrowers or reduce the foreclosure value of agricultural land and equipment that serve as collateral of our loans. Moreover, weaker
prices might threaten farming operations in the Central Valley, reducing market demand for agricultural lending. In particular, farm income has
seen recent declines, and in line with the downturn in farm income, farmland prices are coming under pressure.
We can provide no assurance that economic conditions in the United States in general and in the State of California and within our
operating markets will not further deteriorate or that such deterioration will not materially and adversely affect us. A further deterioration in
economic conditions locally, regionally or nationally could result in a further economic downturn in the Central Valley with the following
consequences, any of which could further adversely affect our business:
• loan delinquencies and defaults may increase;
• problem assets and foreclosures may increase;
• demand for our products and services may decline;
• low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease;
• collateral for loans may decline in value, in turn reducing customers’ borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and
collateral as sources of repayment of existing loans;
• foreclosed assets may not be able to be sold;
• volatile securities market conditions could adversely affect valuations of investment portfolio assets; and
13

Table of Contents
• reputational risk may increase due to public sentiment regarding the banking industry.
In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the
Coronavirus epidemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.
These conditions could have an adverse affect on our customers, especially in the agricultural and agricultural related businesses, which in turn
could affect our business in a similar fashion as noted above. As an example, these conditions could significantly reduce the demand for our
customer’s products or reduce productivity causing loss of income for our customer, potentially leading the customer to default on our loan.
We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks,
extreme weather events or other natural disasters.
The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as coronavirus, or other widespread
health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other
natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could
impair our ability to manage our businesses.
Governmental monetary policies and intervention to stabilize the U.S. financial system may affect our business and are beyond
our control.
The business of banking is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal government and its agencies. Such
policies are beyond our control. We are particularly affected by the policies established by the Federal Reserve Board in relation to the supply of
money and credit in the United States. The instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve Board can be used in varying degrees
and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits,
and this can and does have a material effect on our business.
Liquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and/or investment securities
and from other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer
deposits. Such deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better
risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds,
which would require us to seek wholesale funding alternatives in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our
net interest income and net income. We also rely on alternative funding sources including unsecured borrowing lines with correspondent banks,
secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and public time
certificates of deposits. Our ability to access these sources could be impaired by deterioration in our financial condition as well as factors that are
not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations for the financial services industry or serious
dislocation in the general credit markets. In the event such a disruption should occur, our ability to access these sources could be adversely
affected, both as to price and availability, which would limit or potentially raise the cost of the funds available to us. Any decline in available
funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our strategic plan, including our ability to originate loans, invest in securities,
meet our expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a
material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting
real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.
At December 31, 2019, $773 million, or 82.00% of our total loan and lease portfolio, consisted of real estate related loans. The real estate
securing our loan portfolio is concentrated in California. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a
result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally
affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, the rate of unemployment, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability
of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as
earthquakes and natural disasters. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could
increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our
ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses, which could result in losses that would adversely affect profitability.
Such declines and losses would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, if
hazardous or toxic substances are found on properties pledged as collateral, the value of the real estate could be impaired.

We are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.
In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to
these properties. While we will take steps to mitigate this risk, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property
damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be
required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at one or more properties. The costs associated with
investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, while there are certain statutory protections afforded lenders who take title
to property through foreclosure on a loan, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by
third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to
significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
Supervisory guidance on commercial real estate concentrations could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements
or limits on the conduct of our business.
As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued the CRE Concentration Guidance on sound risk management
practices with respect to a financial institution’s concentrations in commercial real estate lending activities. These guidelines were issued in
response to the agencies’ concerns that rising commercial real estate, or CRE, concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings
and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market. Existing guidance reinforces and enhances existing
regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in
identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The
guidance does not limit banks’ commercial real estate lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of
capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. The CRE Concentration Guidance identifies
certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution’s CRE
concentration risk. The CRE Concentration Guidance is designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management
practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the CRE Concentration Guidance establishes the following supervisory
criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (i) the institution’s total construction, land development and other land loans
represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (ii) total CRE loans as defined in the regulatory guidelines represent 300% or more of total
risk-based capital, and the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. Pursuant to the CRE
Concentration Guidelines, loans secured by owner occupied commercial real estate are not included for purposes of CRE Concentration calculation.
We believe that our underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real
estate loan concentrations are currently sufficient to address the CRE Concentration Guidance.
Agribusiness lending presents unique credit risks.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 2.6% of our total gross loan portfolio was comprised of agribusiness loans. Repayment of
agribusiness loans depends primarily on the successful planting and harvest of crops and marketing the harvested commodity or raising and
feeding of livestock (including milk production). Collateral securing these loans may be illiquid. In addition, the limited purpose of some
agricultural-related collateral affects credit risk because such collateral may have limited or no other uses to support values when loan repayment
problems emerge. Many external factors can impact our agricultural borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, including adverse weather conditions,
water issues, commodity price volatility, diseases, land values, production costs, changing government regulations and subsidy programs, changing
tax treatment, technological changes, labor market shortages/increased wages, and changes in consumers’ preferences, over which our borrowers
may have no control. These factors, as well as recent volatility in certain commodity prices, could adversely impact the ability of those to whom we
have made agribusiness loans to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us, which in turn could result in credit losses and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Small Business Administration lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the
U.S. federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans.
Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender’s
Program (an “SBA Preferred Lender”), we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval
process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to
assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request
corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender’s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA
Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience a
material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including but not limited to changes to the level of guarantee
provided by the federal government on SBA loans, changes to program specific rules impacting volume eligibility
15

Table of Contents
under the guaranty program, as well as changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress may also have a material adverse effect on our
business. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could, among other things,
impede our ability to originate SBA loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
The laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot
predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial
results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures
applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.
If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
Our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans
may be insufficient to assure repayment. We may experience significant credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers
and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We maintain an allowance for loan
losses for probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses based on management’s
evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio and the general economy. The allowance is also appropriately increased for new loan growth.
The allowance is based upon a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience
and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management’s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the
portfolio, historical loan loss experience and loan underwriting policies. The allowance is only an estimate of the probable incurred losses in the
loan portfolio and may not represent actual losses realized over time, either of losses in excess of the allowance or of losses less than the allowance.
If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance my not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary
to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio.
Our bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real
estate acquired through foreclosure and may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Non-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
At December 31, 2019, our non-performing loans and leases were 0.18% of total loans and leases compared to 0.30% at December 31, 2018,
and 0.32% at December 31, 2017, and our non-performing assets (which include foreclosed real estate) were 0.11% of total assets compared to
0.18% at December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans and leases was 539.28% as of December 31,
2019 compared to 332.26% at December 31, 2018. Non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not
record interest income on non-performing loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan
administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair
value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of non-performing assets increases our risk profile and may
impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile, which could result in a request to reduce our
level of non-performing assets. When we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value
of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers’ performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions
beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing
assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other
responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in non-performing assets or that the disposition of such
non-performing assets will not adversely affect our profitability.
Our focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.
Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally are considered riskier than single-family residential loans because they
have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans involve risks
because the borrowers’ ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties
securing the loans. Most of the Bank’s commercial real estate and commercial business loans are made to small to medium sized businesses who
may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the
borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers’ businesses may
hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability.
We realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and
borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience “gaps” in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either
our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either
event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this “gap” will work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected.
We are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates, which are affected by the following factors outside our control:
• inflation;
• recession;
• competition;
• a rise in unemployment;
• tightening money supply;
• international disorder; and
• instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.
Our asset/liability management strategy is designed to address the risk from changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield
curve. However, this strategy may not prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. Our mix of assets has been a balance of loans and securities. The nature of these securities is subject to changes in market
interest rates which may impact the value of these assets.
Additionally, increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may decrease our net interest spread as well as
net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates. Although we believe our current level of
interest rate sensitivity is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates (such as a sudden and substantial increase in Overnight Fed Funds
rates) as well as increasing competition may require us to increase rates on deposits at a faster pace than the yield we receive on interest earning
assets increases.
When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to refinance higher, fixed-rate loans to lower rates, prepaying their existing loans. Under those
circumstances we would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans. In
addition, our commercial real estate and commercial loans, which carry interest rates that, in general, adjust in accordance with changes in the
market rates, will adjust to lower rates. We are also significantly affected by the level of loan demand available in our market. The inability to make
sufficient loans directly affects the interest income we earn. Lower loan demand will generally result in lower interest income realized as we place
funds in lower yielding investments. The impact of any sudden and substantial move in interest rates and/or increased competition may have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition as our net interest income (including the net interest spread and
margin) may be negatively impacted.
We may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.
In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates
required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current
basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will
continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an
acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or
alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.
We have a limited number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or
indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs and risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated
differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition could change our market risk
profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design, and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately
manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the
ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations, we are subject to more stringent capital requirements.
In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, or Basel III, and
issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III is applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital
requirements as well as to bank and saving and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” (generally bank holding
companies with consolidated assets of less than $1.0 billion). Basel III not only increases most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, it
introduces a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. Basel III also expands the current definition
of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. In order
17

Table of Contents
to be a “well-capitalized” depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or
more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or more. The Basel III capital rules
became effective as applied to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period that generally extends through January 1, 2019
for many of the changes.
The failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions
on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and could affect customer and investor
confidence, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our
business, results of operations and financial conditions, generally.
Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.
We face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including finance companies and credit unions. A number of these
banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of banking
services. To a limited extent, we also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms,
consumer finance companies, insurance companies, and fintech companies. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services,
reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we face competition primarily from
other banks in attracting, developing and retaining qualified banking professionals.
Whenever new banks open in our service areas, we see price competition from these new banks, as they work to establish their markets.
The existence of competitors, large and small, is a normal and expected part of our operations, but in responding to the particular short-term
impact on business of new entrants to the marketplace, we could see a negative impact on revenue and income. Moreover, these near term
impacts could be accentuated by the seasonal impact on revenue and income generated by the borrowing and deposit habits of the agricultural
community that comprises a significant component of our customer base.
Technology is continually changing and we must effectively implement new technologies.
Our future growth prospects will be highly dependent on our ability to implement changes in technology that affect the delivery of banking
services such as the increased demand for computer or mobile access to bank accounts and the availability to perform banking transactions
electronically. Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet such
demands. In addition, our business and operations could be susceptible to adverse effects from computer failures, communication and energy
disruption, and activities such as fraud of unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of our data processing
system.
If our information systems were to experience a system failure, our business and reputation could suffer.
We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. The computer systems and network infrastructure we
use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to minimize service disruptions by protecting our
computer equipment, systems, and network infrastructure from physical damage due to fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar
catastrophic event. We have protective measures in place to prevent or limit the effect of the failure or interruption of our information systems, and
will continue to upgrade our security technology and update procedures to help prevent such events. However, if such failures or interruptions
were to occur, they could result in damage to our reputation, a loss of customers, increased regulatory scrutiny, or possible exposure to financial
liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related
incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a financial institution we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that
may be committed against us or our customers which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse
of our information or our customer information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation, or damage to our
reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, on-line banking, phishing, social
engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized
access to systems used by us or our customers, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. There continues to be
a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches, and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial
banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase
in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent periods,
several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not
only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and
employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches which increase
their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud, and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.

Information pertaining to us and our customers is maintained and transactions are executed on the networks and systems of ours, our
customers, and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or core systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of
confidential information as well as execution of transactions over these systems are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and
security breaches and to maintain our customers’ confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent, incidental, cases
have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our customers’ or counterparties’ confidential
information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new
discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a
compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our
customers and underlying transactions as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. Although we have developed and
continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our
security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our customers; our loss of
business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our
online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
More generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-
based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a
financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our controls over financial reporting and related governance procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate
governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and
customer or employee fraud, and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well
designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the
system are met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls, are not insured against, or are in excess of our
insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and
procedures, could have an adverse effect on our business.
Our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.
The processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes
used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends
upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market
stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of
other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we
may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for determining
our probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to
measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not
accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting
models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The current expected credit loss standard established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require significant
data requirements and changes to methodologies.
In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, decided to review how banks
estimate losses in the allowance for credit loss calculation, and it issued the final Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard on June 16,
2016. Currently, the impairment model used by financial institutions is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there
is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the
CECL model that will become effective for the Bank for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022 in which financial institutions will be
required to use historical information, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan.
Management established a task force to begin the implementation process. The transition to the CECL model will require significantly greater data
requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses. The Bank will likely be required to increase its allowance for
credit losses as a result of the implementation of CECL. An increase in the allowance would increase the provision for credit losses, decreasing net
income and retained earnings.

We have a significant deferred tax asset and cannot assure that it will be fully realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax
basis of assets and liabilities computed using enacted tax rates. We regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether
it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to apply significant
judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty. At December 31, 2019, we had a net
deferred tax asset of $8.74 million. If we were to determine at some point in the future that we will not achieve sufficient future taxable income to
realize our net deferred tax asset, we would be required, under generally accepted accounting principles, to establish a full or partial valuation
allowance which would require us to incur a charge to operations for the period in which the determination was made.
The effects of changes to FDIC insurance coverage limits are uncertain and increased premiums may adversely affect us.
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to applicable legal limits. All of a depositors’
accounts at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest bearing transactions accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the
standard maximum deposit insurance amount of ($250,000) for each deposit insurance ownership category.
Increases in FDIC insurance premiums will add to our cost of operations and could have a significant impact on the Bank. Depending on any
future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer due to failed institutions, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional
significant premium increases in order to replenish the fund.
On February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted the final rule, which redefined the deposit insurance assessment base as
required by Dodd-Frank, and makes changes to assessment rates, implements Dodd-Frank’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) dividend provisions, and
revises the risk based assessment system for all large institutions. The final rule redefined the deposit insurance assessment base as average
consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, defined as Tier 1 capital. The rule lowered overall assessment rates in order to generate
the same approximate amount of revenue under the new larger base as was raised under the old base. In 2016, the FDIC board of directors
approved a final rule revising DIF assessment formulas for community banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been FDIC-insured for at
least five years. The revised method better reflects risks and helps ensure that banks that take on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than
their less risk counterparts. The method change is revenue-neutral meaning aggregate assessment revenue collected from established small banks
is expected to be approximately the same as it would have been using the prior method. Assessments were expected to drop by an average of
approximately one-third. The range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declines to between 3 cents and 30 cents per $100 of the
assessment base from between 5 cents and 35 cents.
We have and in the future we may be required to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the
FHLB stock we hold.
Our securities portfolio contains whole loan private mortgage-backed securities and currently includes securities with unrecognized losses
and securities that have been downgraded to below investment grade by national rating agencies. We may continue to observe declines in the fair
market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other-than-temporary impairment each reporting period, as required
by generally accepted accounting principles. Numerous factors, including the lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain securities, the absence of
reliable pricing information for securities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse regulatory actions or unanticipated changes in the
competitive environment, could have a negative effect on our securities portfolio and results of operations in future periods. There can be no
assurance, however, that future evaluations of the securities portfolio will not require us to recognize further impairment charges with respect to
these and other holdings.
In addition, as a condition to membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the FHLB), we are required to purchase and
hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from
the FHLB. At December 31, 2019, we held stock in the FHLB totaling $6,062,000 as compared to our minimum required stock holding of
$5,271,000. The FHLB stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. To date,
the FHLB has not discontinued the distribution of dividends on its shares. However, there can be no assurance the FHLB’s dividend-paying
practices will continue. As of December 31, 2019, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings. There can be no
assurance, however, that future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may not require us to recognize an impairment charge
with respect to such holdings.

If the goodwill we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have an adverse impact on our
earnings and capital.
At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $53,777,000 of goodwill on our balance sheet attributable to our acquisitions of the Bank of
Madera County in January 2005, Service 1st Bancorp in November 2008, Visalia Community Bank in July 2013, Sierra Vista Bank in October 2016,
and Folsom Lake Bank in October 2017. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, our goodwill is not amortized but rather
evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such
evaluation is based on a variety of factors, including the quoted price of our common stock, market prices of the common stock of other banking
organizations, common stock trading multiples, discounted cash flows, and data from comparable acquisitions. There can be no assurance that
future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and write-downs, which could be material.
We may not be successful in raising additional capital needed in the future.
We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments
and business strategies. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at
that time which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. We cannot be assured that such capital will be available to us on
acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to
raise capital. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to
raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when
needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely
affect the market price of our common stock.
We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that
represent the right to receive, common stock. We frequently evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets taking into account our
regulatory capital ratios, financial condition and other relevant considerations, and subject to market conditions, we may take further capital
actions. Such actions could include, among other things, the issuance of additional shares of common stock in public or private transactions in
order to further increase our capital levels above the requirements for a well-capitalized institution established by the Federal bank regulatory
agencies as well as other regulatory targets.
The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or that represent
the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities including, without limitation, securities issued upon exercise of outstanding
stock options under our stock option plans, could be substantially dilutive to shareholders of our common stock. With the exception of one major
shareholder, holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering
of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our shareholders. The market price of
our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur.
We may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial
condition.
We have initiated internal asset growth programs, completed various acquisitions and opened additional offices in prior years. We may not
be able to sustain our historical rate of asset growth or may not even be able to grow at all. We may not be able to obtain the financing necessary
to fund additional asset growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition. Various factors, such as economic conditions and
competition, may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices. Further, our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may
adversely affect our internal asset growth. A significant decrease in our historical rate of asset growth may adversely impact our results of
operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to complete future acquisitions, and once complete, may not be able to integrate our acquisitions
successfully.
Our growth strategy includes our desire to acquire other financial institutions. We may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and,
for completed acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities we
acquire. We may not realize expected cost savings or make revenue enhancements. Following each acquisition, we must expend substantial
managerial, operating, financial and other resources to integrate these entities. In particular, we may be required to install and standardize
adequate operational and control systems, deploy or modify equipment, implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and
employ and maintain qualified personnel. Our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially
adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.
We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Threats to our reputation can come
from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver
minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. Negative publicity
regarding our industry, Bank, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly
litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or
otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results and the value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.
Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.
Our risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to
which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or
other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under
all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer
unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We
may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.
We are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which, in turn, may hamper our
ability to increase our assets and earnings.
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and we are subject to various laws
and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Similarly, the lending, credit and
deposit products we offer are subject to broad oversight and regulation. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, regulations and
supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Perennially, various laws, rules and regulations
are proposed, which, if adopted, could impact our operations by making compliance much more difficult or expensive, restricting our ability to
originate or sell loans or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products. Current and future
legal and regulatory requirements, restrictions and regulations, including those imposed under Dodd-Frank, may adversely impact our profitability
and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, may require us to invest significant
management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes required by the legislation and accompanying rules, and may make it more
difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees.
We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes
and regulations.
The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to
institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The
federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and
has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice,
Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed
deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and
the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate
programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common
stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.
At times, the stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility, which has
reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to
those issuers’ underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause
significant price variations to occur. This may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find
attractive. The low trading volume in our common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market means that our shares may have less liquidity than other
publicly traded
22

Table of Contents
companies. We cannot ensure that the volume of trading in our common shares will be maintained or will increase in the future.
The trading price of the shares of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and which may be
beyond our control, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales or offerings of
our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified above in the forward-looking statement discussion under the section titled
“Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and below. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may
continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:
• actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;
• changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken
by rating agencies with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions;
• failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;
• speculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation, our market area, our competitors or
the financial services industry in general;
• strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;
• actions by our current shareholders, including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and/or directors and executive
officers;
• fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;
• future sales of our equity, equity-related or debt securities;
• changes in the frequency or amount of dividends or share repurchases;
• proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;
• anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involves or affects us;
• trading activities in our common stock, including short-selling;
• domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; and
• general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.
A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.
An investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.
Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any
other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk Factors” section and
elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire
our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.
Anti-takeover provisions and federal law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price
to decline.
Various provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and certain other actions we have taken could delay or prevent a third party
from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change
in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, regulatory
approval and/or appropriate regulatory filings may be required from either or all the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the DBO prior to any person
or entity acquiring “control” (as defined in the applicable regulations) of a state non-member bank, such as the Bank. These provisions may prevent
a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our
common stock.
The Company is a holding company and depends on the Bank for dividends, distributions, and other payments
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay
dividends to our shareholders, is dividends from the Bank. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is substantially dependent
upon the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Federal and state law imposes limits on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and make
other distributions and payments. If the Bank is unable to meet regulatory requirements to pay dividends or make other distributions to the
Company, the Company will be unable to pay dividends to its stockholders.

Dividends per

We paid common share cash dividends of $0.43 and $0.31 per share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s primary source of
income with which to pay cash dividends is dividends from the Bank. See Note 15 in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this Annual Report.
The amount of future dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, and will be
determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis. It is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally pay dividends on
common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s
expected future needs and financial condition. It is also Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies not maintain dividend levels that
undermine the holding company’s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has indicated that
bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels
unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action regulations, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC may
prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized.
24

Table of Contents
As a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is affected by the ability of our bank subsidiary, to pay cash dividends. The ability of
the Bank (and our ability) to pay cash dividends in the future and the amount of any such cash dividends is and could be in the future further
influenced by bank regulatory requirements and approvals and capital guidelines.
The decision whether to pay dividends will be made by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including factors such as
our results of operations, financial condition, business conditions, regulatory capital requirements and covenants under any applicable contractual
arrangements, including agreements with regulatory authorities.
The Company has outstanding trust preferred securities from special purpose trust and accompanying subordinated debt. The subordinated
debt is senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debt before any dividends can be paid on
our common stock. Under the terms of the subordinated debt, we may defer interest payments for up to five years. If the Company should ever
defer such interest payments, we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividends on any shares of our common stock.
For information on the statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of the Company to pay dividends and on the Bank to pay dividends

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, including the Notes thereto, in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Certain matters discussed in this report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained herein that are not historical facts, such as statements regarding the
Company’s current business strategy and the Company’s plans for future development and operations, are based upon current
expectations. These statements are forward-looking in nature and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Such risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to (1) significant increases in competitive pressure in the banking industry; (2) the impact
of changes in interest rates; (3) a decline in economic conditions in the Central Valley and the Greater Sacramento Region; (4) the
Company’s ability to continue its internal growth at historical rates; (5) the Company’s ability to maintain its net interest margin; (6)
the decline in quality of the Company’s earning assets; (7) a decline in credit quality; (8) changes in the regulatory environment;
(9) fluctuations in the real estate market; (10) changes in business conditions and inflation; (11) changes in securities markets
(12) risks associated with acquisitions, relating to difficulty in integrating combined operations and related negative impact on
earnings, and incurrence of substantial expenses; (13) political developments, uncertainties or instability, catastrophic events, acts of
war or terrorism, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, drought, pandemic diseases or extreme weather events, any of which may
affect services we use or affect our customers, employees or third parties with which we conduct business. Therefore, the
information set forth in such forward-looking statements should be carefully considered when evaluating the business prospects of
the Company.
When the Company uses in this Annual Report the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “commit,”
“believe” and similar expressions, the Company intends to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees
of performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in this Annual Report.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, expected, projected, intended, committed or believed. The future results and
shareholder values of the Company may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the
factors that will determine these results and values are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. For those statements, the
Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. See also the discussion of risk factors in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
We are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results. You should not place undue reliance on any forward
looking statement, which speaks only as of the date of this Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by applicable laws or
regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.
INTRODUCTION
Central Valley Community Bancorp (NASDAQ: CVCY) (the Company) was incorporated on February 7, 2000. The formation of the holding
company offered the Company more flexibility in meeting the long-term needs of customers, shareholders, and the communities it serves. The
Company currently has one bank subsidiary, Central Valley Community Bank (the Bank) and one business trust subsidiary, Service 1st Capital Trust
1. The Company’s market area includes the central valley area from Sacramento, California to Bakersfield, California.
During 2019, we focused on asset quality and capital adequacy. We also focused on assuring that competitive products and services were
made available to our clients while adjusting to the many new laws and regulations that affect the banking industry.
As of December 31, 2019, the Bank operated 20 full-service offices. Additionally, the Bank maintains a Commercial Real Estate Division, an
Agribusiness Center and a SBA Lending Division. The Real Estate Division processes or assists in processing the majority of the Bank’s real estate
related transactions, including interim construction loans for single family residences and commercial buildings. We offer permanent single family
residential loans through our mortgage broker services.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Over the last several years the economy, as evidenced by the California, Central Valley, and Greater Sacrament Region unemployment rates,
and housing prices have shown slow but steady improvement. Housing in the Central Valley continues to be relatively more affordable than the
major metropolitan areas in California.
Agriculture and agricultural-related businesses remain a critical part of the Central Valley’s economy. The Valley’s agricultural production
is widely diversified, producing nuts, vegetables, fruit, cattle, dairy products, and cotton. The continued future success of agriculture related
businesses is highly dependent on the availability of water and is subject to fluctuation in worldwide commodity prices, currency exchanges, and
demand. From time to time, California experiences severe droughts or adverse weather issues, which could significantly harm the business of our
customers and the credit quality of the loans to those customers. We closely monitor the water resources and the related issues affecting our
customers, and will remain vigilant for signs of deterioration within the loan portfolio in an effort to manage credit quality and work with borrowers
where possible to mitigate any losses.
An additional negative affect on the agricultural industry is the “Tariff War”, especially with China. The increased tariffs on agricultural
products by China has an adverse effect on demand potentially causing financial difficulty for farmers. We are closely monitoring how the
agricultural industry is adapting through developing new markets for their products.
In December 2019, a novel strain of Coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak
to constitute a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern." The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production
and sales across a range of industries. The extent of the impact of the Coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on
certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are
uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which the Coronavirus may impact our financial condition or results of operations is
uncertain.
OVERVIEW
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.59 compared to $1.54 and $1.10 for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net income for 2019 was $21,443,000 compared to $21,289,000 and $14,026,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net income and EPS was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and an
increase in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, an increase in the
provision for credit losses, and an increase in the provision for income taxes in 2019 compared to 2018. Total assets at December 31, 2019 were
$1,596,755,000 compared to $1,537,836,000 at December 31, 2018.
Return on average equity for 2019 was 9.39% compared to 10.07% and 7.69% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Return on average assets
for 2019 was 1.36% compared to 1.35% and 0.94% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total equity was $228,128,000 at December 31, 2019
compared to $219,738,000 at December 31, 2018. The increase in equity in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by the retention of
earnings, net of dividends paid, and an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) securities recorded, net of estimated taxes, in
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
Average total loans increased $18,755,000 or 2.06% to $930,883,000 in 2019 compared to $912,128,000 in 2018. In 2019, we recorded a
provision for credit losses of $1,025,000 compared to a provision of $50,000 in 2018 and a reverse provision of $1,150,000 in 2017. The Company
had nonperforming assets consisting of $1,693,000 in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets
totaled $2,740,000. Net loan loss charge-offs for 2019 were $999,000 compared to net loan loss recoveries in the amount of $276,000 for 2018 and
$602,000 for 2017. Refer to “Asset Quality” below for further information.

• Return to our shareholders;
• Return on average assets;
• Development of revenue streams, including net interest income and non-interest income;
• Asset quality;
• Asset growth;
• Capital adequacy;
• Operating efficiency; and
• Liquidity.
Return to Our Shareholders
29

Table of Contents
One measure of our return to our shareholders is the return on average equity (ROE), which is a ratio that measures net income divided by
average shareholders’ equity. Our ROE was 9.39% for the year ended 2019 compared to 10.07% and 7.69% for the years ended 2018 and 2017,
respectively.
Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $154,000 compared to 2018 and increased $7,263,000 in 2018 compared
to 2017. Contributing to the increase during 2019 was an increase in net interest income and an increase in net realized gains on sales and calls of
investment securities, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, an increase in the provision for credit losses, and an increase in the
provision for income taxes. During 2018, net income compared to 2017 was positively impacted by the decrease in tax expense. During 2017 net
income was negatively impacted by the re-measurement of our deferred tax asset and corresponding increase in tax expense.
Net interest income increased primarily because of increases in loan and investment income, partially offset by increases in interest expense
on deposits. The impact to interest income from the accretion of the loan marks on acquired loans was an increase of $989,000 and $1,158,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For 2019, our net interest margin (NIM) increased seven basis points to 4.51%
compared to 2018 as a result of yield changes and asset mix changes. The increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison
resulted primarily from the increase in the effective yield on interest-earning deposits in other banks and Federal Funds sold, the increase in the
effective yield on average investment securities, and the increase in the yield on the Company’s loan portfolio. Net interest income during 2019 was
positively impacted by the collection of nonaccrual loans which resulted in a recovery of interest income of approximately $1,156,000. The recovery
was partially offset by reversal of approximately $377,000 in interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual during the year. Net interest income
during 2018 was positively impacted by the collection of nonaccrual loans which resulted in a net recovery of interest income of approximately
$720,000. The recovery in 2018 was partially offset by reversal of approximately $222,000 in interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual during
the year.
Non-interest income increased 28.87% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $3,885,000 increase in net realized gains on sales and
calls of investment securities and an increase in loan placement fees of $270,000, partially offset by decrease in gain on sale of credit card portfolio
of $462,000, a decrease in service charge income of $230,000, a decrease of $364,000 in other income, and a $135,000 decrease in Federal Home
Loan Bank dividends.
Non-interest expenses increased $1,032,000 or 2.29% to $46,100,000 in 2019 compared to $45,068,000 in 2018. The net increase year over
year was attributable to increases in information technology of $1,498,000, salaries and employee benefits of $433,000, directors’ expenses of
$245,000, amortization of core deposit intangibles of $240,000, and telephone expenses of $125,000, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy
and equipment expenses of $533,000, a decrease of $368,000 in regulatory assessments, a decrease in operating losses of $350,000, a decrease in
acquisition and integration expenses of $217,000, a decrease of $170,000 in professional services ,and a decrease of $109,000 in data processing
expenses, in 2019 compared to 2018. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $8,509,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019,
compared to $6,620,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $9,793,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company recognized
additional tax expense in 2017 in the amount of $3,535,000 related to a tax law change enacted in 2017. Basic EPS was $1.60 for 2019 compared to
$1.55 and $1.12 for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Diluted EPS was $1.59 for 2019 compared to $1.54 and $1.10 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in EPS for 2019 is primarily due to the increase in net income.
Return on Average Assets
Our return on average assets (ROA) is a ratio that measures our performance compared with other banks and bank holding companies. Our
ROA for the year ended 2019 was 1.36% compared to 1.35% and 0.94% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The 2019
increase in ROA is primarily due to the increase in net income. Annualized ROA for our peer group was 1.37% at December 31, 2019. Peer group
information from S&P Global Market Intelligence data includes bank holding companies in central California with assets from $600 million to $3.5
billion.
Development of Revenue Streams
Over the past several years, we have focused on not only our net income, but improving the consistency of our revenue streams in order to
create more predictable future earnings and reduce the effect of changes in our operating environment on our net income. Specifically, we have
focused on net interest income through a variety of strategies, including increases in average interest earning assets, and minimizing the effects of
the recent interest rate changes on our net interest margin by focusing on core deposits and managing our cost of funds. Our net interest margin
(fully tax equivalent basis) was 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.44% and 4.40% for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 net interest margin compared to 2018, resulted from the increase in the effective yield on
interest earning deposits in other banks and Federal Funds sold, the increase in the effective yield on average investment securities, and the
increase in the yield on the Company’s loan portfolio. The effective tax equivalent yield on total earning assets increased 15 basis points, while the
cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points to 0.34% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our cost of total deposits in 2019
and 2018 was 0.15% and 0.09%, respectively, compared to
30

Table of Contents
0.08% for the same period in 2017. Our net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $1,069,000 or 1.70% to $63,772,000 for the
year ended 2019 compared to $62,703,000 and $56,239,000 for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our non-interest income is generally made up of service charges and fees on deposit accounts, fee income from loan placements,
appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance, and net gains from sales and calls of investment securities. Non-interest income
in 2019 increased $2,981,000 or 28.87% to $13,305,000 compared to $10,324,000 in 2018 and $10,836,000 in 2017. The increase resulted
primarily from increases in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, appreciation in cash surrender value of bank-owned life
insurance, and loan placement fees, partially offset by a decrease in service charge income, a net gain on the sale of the Company’s credit card
portfolio, interchange fees, and Federal Home Loan Bank dividends compared to 2018. Further detail on non-interest income is provided below.
Asset Quality
For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality has a significant impact on the overall financial condition and results of operations.
Asset quality is measured in terms of classified and nonperforming loans, and is a key element in estimating the future earnings of a company.
Total nonperforming assets were $1,693,000 and $2,740,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Nonperforming assets totaled 0.18% of
gross loans as of December 31, 2019 and 0.30% of gross loans as of December 31, 2018. Nonperforming loans were $1,693,000 and $2,740,000 at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had no other real estate owned at December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018. No
foreclosed assets were recorded at December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. Management maintains certain loans that have been brought
current by the borrower (less than 30 days delinquent) on nonaccrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are
likely to remain current in future periods.
The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.18% as of December 31, 2019 and 0.30% as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for
credit losses as a percentage of outstanding loan balance was 0.97% as of December 31, 2019 and 0.99% as of December 31, 2018. The ratio of net
(charge-offs) recoveries to average loans was (0.11)% as of December 31, 2019 and 0.03% as of December 31, 2018.
Asset Growth
As revenues from both net interest income and non-interest income are a function of asset size, the continued growth in assets has a direct
impact in increasing net income and therefore ROE and ROA. The majority of our assets are loans and investment securities, and the majority of
our liabilities are deposits, and therefore the ability to generate deposits as a funding source for loans and investments is fundamental to our asset
growth. Total assets increased 3.83% during 2019 to $1,596,755,000 as of December 31, 2019 from $1,537,836,000 as of December 31, 2018.
Total gross loans increased 2.69% to $943,380,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $918,695,000 at December 31, 2018. Total investment
securities increased 1.50% to $478,218,000 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $471,159,000 as of December 31, 2018. Total deposits
increased 3.98% to $1,333,285,000 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $1,282,298,000 as of December 31, 2018. Our loan to deposit ratio at
December 31, 2019 was 70.76% compared to 71.64% at December 31, 2018. The loan to deposit ratio of our peers was 82.00% at December 31,
2019. Peer group information from S&P Global Market Intelligence data includes bank holding companies in central California with assets from
$600 million to $3.5 billion.
Capital Adequacy
At December 31, 2019, we had a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 15.79%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 14.98%, common
equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.55%, and a leverage ratio of 11.38%. At December 31, 2018, we had a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 16.44%,
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 15.59%, common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.13%, and a leverage ratio of 11.48%. At December 31, 2019, on a
stand-alone basis, the Bank had a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.66%, a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 14.85%, common equity Tier 1 ratio of
14.85%, and a leverage ratio of 11.27%. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.23%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of
15.38% and a leverage ratio of 11.32%. Note 14 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements provides more detailed information concerning
the Company’s capital amounts and ratios. As of January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more ($3 Billion
or more effective August 30, 2018) and banks like Central Valley Community Bank became subject to new capital requirements, and certain
provisions of the new rules were phased in through 2019 under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank met or
exceeded all of their capital requirements inclusive of the capital buffer. The Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory guidelines for a well-
capitalized financial institution under the Basel III regulatory requirements at December 31, 2019.

Operating Efficiency
Operating efficiency is the measure of how efficiently earnings before taxes are generated as a percentage of revenue. A lower ratio
represents greater efficiency. The Company’s efficiency ratio (operating expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles and foreclosed property
expense, divided by net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses from sale of securities) was 62.77% for 2019
compared to 61.23% for 2018 and 62.03% for 2017. The slight increase in the efficiency ratios in 2019 and 2018 was due to the growth in non-
interest expense outpacing the growth in non-interest income. The Company’s net interest income before provision for credit losses plus non-
interest income increased 5.55% to $77,077,000 in 2019 compared to $73,027,000 in 2018 and $67,075,000 in 2017, while operating expenses
increased 2.29% in 2019, 1.49% in 2018, and 14.09% in 2017.
Liquidity
Liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily
operations, which include providing for customers’ credit needs, funding of securities purchases, and ongoing repayment of borrowings. Our
liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by our management and Directors’ Asset/Liability Committee. This process
is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs, including adequate cash flows for off-balance sheet commitments. Our
primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and, to a lesser extent, broker deposits,
Federal funds facilities and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. We have available unsecured lines of credit with
correspondent banks totaling approximately $70,000,000 and secured borrowing lines of approximately $304,987,000 with the Federal Home Loan
Bank. These funding sources are augmented by collection of principal and interest on loans, the routine maturities and pay downs of securities from
our investment securities portfolio, the stability of our core deposits, and the ability to sell investment securities. Primary uses of funds include
origination and purchases of loans, withdrawals of and interest payments on deposits, purchases of investment securities, and payment of operating
expenses.
We had liquid assets (cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other banks, Federal funds sold, equity securities, and available-
for-sale securities) totaling $530,792,000 or 33.24% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and $502,886,000 or 32.70% of total assets as of
December 31, 2018.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Income
Net income was $21,443,000 in 2019 compared to $21,289,000 and $14,026,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Basic earnings per share
was $1.60, $1.55, and $1.12 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was $1.59, $1.54, and $1.10 for 2019, 2018, and
2017, respectively. ROE was 9.39% for 2019 compared to 10.07% for 2018 and 7.69% for 2017. ROA for 2019 was 1.36% compared to 1.35% for
2018 and 0.94% for 2017.
The increase in net income for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and an increase in net
realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, an increase in the provision for
credit losses, and an increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in net income for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a
decrease in provision for income taxes and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses, an
increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in non-interest income.
Interest Income and Expense
Net interest income is the most significant component of our income from operations. Net interest income (the interest rate spread) is the
difference between the gross interest and fees earned on the loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on deposits and other
borrowings. Net interest income depends on the volume of and interest rate earned on interest-earning assets and the volume of and interest rate
paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
The following table sets forth a summary of average balances with corresponding interest income and interest expense as well as average
yield and cost information for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances, and nonaccrual loans are not included as
interest-earning assets for purposes of this table.

Interest and fee income from loans increased $1,528,000 or 3.06% in 2019 compared to 2018. Interest and fee income from loans increased
$6,402,000 or 14.71% in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in 2019 is primarily attributable to an increase in average total loans outstanding
and a slight increase in the yield on loans by four basis points. The net interest income during 2019 was positively impacted by the collection of
nonaccrual loans which resulted in a recovery of interest income of approximately $1,156,000. The recovery was partially offset by reversal of
approximately $377,000 in interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual status during the year. Net interest income during 2018 was positively
impacted by the collection of nonaccrual loans which resulted in a recovery of interest income of approximately $720,000. The recovery was
partially offset by reversal of approximately $222,000 in interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual status during the year.
Average total loans for 2019 increased $18,755,000 to $930,883,000 compared to $912,128,000 for 2018 and $793,343,000 for 2017. The
yield on loans for 2019 was 5.54% compared to 5.50% and 5.51% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact to interest income from the accretion
of the loan marks on acquired loans was an increase of $989,000 and $1,158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Interest income from total investments on a non tax-equivalent basis, (total investments include investment securities, Federal funds sold,
interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and other securities), increased $616,000 or 4.32% in 2019 compared to 2018. The yield on average
investments increased 20 basis points to 3.08% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 2.88% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average
total investments decreased $32,151,000 to $494,455,000 in 2019 compared to $526,606,000 in 2018. In 2018, total investment income on a non
tax-equivalent basis increased $409,000 or 2.95% compared to 2017.
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by
mortgage backed obligations and obligations of states and political subdivision securities. However, a significant portion of the investment portfolio
is mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). At December 31, 2019, we held $356,097,000 or 75.65% of
the total market value of the investment portfolio in MBS and CMOs with an average yield of 3.06%. We invest in CMOs and MBS as part of our
overall strategy to increase our net interest margin. CMOs and MBS by their nature are affected by prepayments which are impacted by changes
in interest rates. In a normal declining rate environment, prepayments from MBS and CMOs would be expected to increase and the expected life of
the investment would be expected to shorten. Conversely, if interest rates increase, prepayments normally would be expected to decline and the
average life of the MBS and CMOs would be expected to extend. Premium amortization

and discount accretion of these investments affects our net interest income. Our management monitors the prepayment trends of these
investments and adjusts premium amortization and discount accretion based on several factors. These factors include the type of investment, the
investment structure, interest rates, interest rates on new mortgage loans, expectation of interest rate changes, current economic conditions, the
level of principal remaining on the bond, the bond coupon rate, the bond origination date, and volume of available bonds in market. The calculation
of premium amortization and discount accretion is by nature inexact, and represents management’s best estimate of principal pay downs inherent
in the total investment portfolio.
The cumulative net-of-tax effect of the change in market value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019 was an
unrealized gain of $2,817,000 and is reflected in the Company’s equity. At December 31, 2019, the effective duration of the investment portfolio
was 4 years and the market value reflected a pre-tax unrealized gain of $3,999,000. Management reviews market value declines on individual
investment securities to determine whether they represent other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). For the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018, and 2017, no OTTI was recorded. Future deterioration in the market values of our investment securities may require the Company to
recognize additional OTTI losses.
A component of the Company’s strategic plan has been to use its investment portfolio to offset, in part, its interest rate risk relating to
variable rate loans. Measured at December 31, 2019, an immediate rate increase of 200 basis points would result in an estimated decrease in the
market value of the investment portfolio by approximately $37,000,000. Conversely, with an immediate rate decrease of 200 basis points, the
estimated increase in the market value of the investment portfolio would be $35,000,000. The modeling environment assumes management would
take no action during an immediate shock of 200 basis points. However, the Company uses those increments to measure its interest rate risk in
accordance with regulatory requirements and to measure the possible future risk in the investment portfolio. For further discussion of the
Company’s market risk, refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Management’s review of all investments before purchase includes an analysis of how the security will perform under several interest rate
scenarios to monitor whether investments are consistent with our investment policy. The policy addresses issues of average life, duration, and
concentration guidelines, prohibited investments, impairment, and prohibited practices.
Total interest income in 2019 increased $2,144,000 to $66,331,000 compared to $64,187,000 in 2018 and $57,376,000 in 2017,
respectively. The increase in 2019 was the result of yield changes and asset mix changes. The tax-equivalent yield on interest earning assets
increased to 4.69% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average interest earning assets
decreased to $1,423,015,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,435,025,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average
interest-earning deposits in other banks decreased $6,202,000 comparing 2019 to 2018. Average yield on these deposits was 2.10% compared to
1.91% on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 respectively. Average investments and interest-earning deposits decreased $32,151,000 but
the tax equivalent yield on those assets increased 20 basis points. Average total loans increased $18,755,000 and the yield on average loans
increased four basis points.
The increase in total interest income for 2018 was the result of yield changes, increase in interest rates, asset mix changes, and an increase
in average earning assets. The yield on interest-earning assets increased to 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 4.48% for the year
ended December 31, 2017. Average interest-earning assets increased to $1,435,025,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to
$1,358,930,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Interest expense on deposits in 2019 increased $775,000 or 67.22% to $1,928,000 compared to $1,153,000 in 2018 and increased $959,000
as compared to 2017. The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased 11 basis points to 0.26% in 2019 from 0.15% in 2018. The yield on interest-
bearing deposits increased three basis points to 0.15% in 2018 from 0.12% in 2017. Average interest-bearing deposits were $738,432,000 for 2019
compared to $780,449,000 and $784,318,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Average other borrowings were $21,943,000 with an effective rate of 2.88% for 2019 compared to $12,180,000 with an effective rate of
2.72% for 2018. In 2017, the average other borrowings were $6,930,000 with an effective rate of 2.42%. Included in other borrowings are the
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures acquired from Service 1st, advances on lines of credit, advances from the Federal Home Loan
Bank (FHLB), and overnight borrowings. The debentures carry a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.60%. The rate
was 3.59% for 2019, 4.04% for 2018, and 2.96% for 2017.
The cost of all interest-bearing liabilities was 0.34% and 0.19% basis points for 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to 0.14% for 2017.
The cost of total deposits increased to 0.15% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.09% and 0.08% for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Average demand deposits increased 0.73% to $557,348,000 in 2019 compared to $553,305,000 for
2018 and $499,987,000 for 2017. The ratio of average non-interest demand deposits to average total deposits increased to 43.01% for 2019
compared to 41.48% and 38.93% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net Interest Income before Provision for Credit Losses
Net interest income before provision for credit losses for 2019 increased $1,069,000 or 1.70% to $63,772,000 compared to $62,703,000 for
2018 and $56,239,000 for 2017. The increase in 2019 was due to the increase in yields on average earning assets, asset mix changes, and a
decrease in average interest bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin (NIM) increased seven basis points. Yield on interest earning assets
increased 15 basis points. The increase in net interest margin in the period-to-period comparison resulted primarily from the increase in the
effective yield on interest earning deposits in other banks and Federal Funds sold, the increase in the effective yield on average investment
securities, and the increase in the yield on the Company’s loan portfolio. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased
$6,464,000 in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in average earning assets. Average interest-earning assets were
$1,423,015,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 with a NIM of 4.51% compared to $1,435,025,000 with a NIM of 4.44% in 2018, and
$1,358,930,000 with a NIM of 4.40% in 2017. For a discussion of the repricing of our assets and liabilities, refer to Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure about Market Risk.
Provision for Credit Losses
We provide for probable incurred credit losses through a charge to operating income based upon the change in balance and composition of
the loan portfolio, delinquency levels, historical losses and nonperforming assets, economic and environmental conditions and other factors which,
in management’s judgment, deserve recognition in estimating credit losses. Loans are charged off when they are considered uncollectible or when
continuance as an active earning bank asset is not warranted.
The establishment of an adequate credit allowance is based on both an accurate risk rating system and loan portfolio management tools.
The Board of Directors have established initial responsibility for the accuracy of credit risk grades with the individual credit officer. The Credit
Review Officer (CRO) will review loans to ensure the accuracy of the risk grade and is empowered to change any risk grade, as appropriate. The
CRO is not involved in loan originations. Quarterly, the credit officers must certify the current risk grade of the loans in their portfolio. The CRO
reviews the certifications. At least quarterly the CRO reports his activities to the Board of Directors Audit Committee; and at least annually the loan
portfolio is reviewed by a third party credit reviewer and by various regulatory agencies.
Quarterly, the Chief Credit Officer (CCO) sets the specific reserve for all impaired credits. Additionally, the CCO is responsible to ensure
that the general reserves on non-impaired loans are properly set each quarter. This process includes the utilization of loan delinquency reports,
classified asset reports, collateral analysis and portfolio concentration reports to assist in accurately assessing credit risk and establishing
appropriate reserves.
The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the Board of Directors Audit Committee and by the Board of Directors.
General reserves are allocated to loan portfolio categories using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as
delinquencies and losses and predictive risk elements such as economic, competitive and environmental factors. We have adopted the specific
reserve approach to allocate reserves to each impaired credit for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure. Although the allowance for
credit losses is allocated to various portfolio categories, it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety. Changes in the
allowance for credit losses may be required based on the results of independent loan portfolio examinations, regulatory agency examinations, or
our own internal review process. Additions are also required when, in management’s judgment, the allowance does not properly reflect the
portfolio’s probable loss exposure. Management believes that all adjustments, if any, to the allowance for credit losses are supported by the timely
and consistent application of methodologies and processes resulting in detailed documentation of the allowance calculation and other portfolio
trending analysis.

Loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loans are deemed uncollectible. It is the policy of management to make
additions to the allowance so that it remains adequate to cover all probable incurred credit losses that exist in the portfolio at that time. We assign
qualitative and environmental factors (Q factors) to each loan category. Q factors include reserves held for the effects of lending policies, economic
trends, and portfolio trends along with other dynamics which may cause additional stress to the portfolio.
Managing high-risk credits identified through the risk evaluation methodology includes developing a business strategy with the customer to
mitigate our potential losses. Management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when, and to what
extent, additional provisions may be necessary. Management believes that the level of allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and real
estate loans has been adjusted accordingly.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1,025,000 compared to a provision of
$50,000 and a reverse provision of $1,150,000 for the same periods in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The recorded provision and reverse provisions
to the allowance for credit losses are primarily the result of our assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considering a
number of factors as discussed in the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section.
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 the Company had net charge-offs (recoveries) totaling $999,000, $(276,000),
and $(602,000), respectively. The net charge-off (recovery) ratio, which reflects net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans, was 0.11%, (0.03)%
and (0.08)% for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Nonperforming loans were $1,693,000 and $2,740,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Nonperforming loans as a percentage
of total loans were 0.18% at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.30% at December 31, 2018. The Company had no other real estate owned at
December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. No foreclosed assets were recorded at December 31, 2019 or December 31,
2018. The carrying value of foreclosed assets was $70,000 at December 31, 2017, and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets. At December 31, 2019, we had $183,000 loans past due, not including nonaccrual loans compared to $1,208,000 loans past due at
December 31, 2018.
Economic pressures may negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the Company has extended credit and as a result
when negative economic conditions are anticipated, we may be required to make significant provisions to the allowance for credit losses. The Bank
conducts banking operation principally in California’s Central Valley. The Central Valley is largely dependent on agriculture. The agricultural
economy in the Central Valley is therefore important to our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows. We are also dependent in a
large part upon the business activity, population growth, income levels and real estate activity in this market area. A downturn in agriculture and
the agricultural related businesses could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The agricultural
industry has been affected by declines in prices and the changes in yields on various crops and other agricultural commodities. Weaker prices could
reduce the cash flows generated by farms and the value of agricultural land in our local markets and thereby increase the risk of default by our
borrowers or reduce the foreclosure value of agricultural land and equipment that serve as collateral of our loans. Further declines in commodity
prices or collateral values may increase the incidence of default by our borrowers. Moreover, weaker prices might threaten farming operations in
the Central Valley, reducing market demand for agricultural lending. In particular, farm income has seen recent declines, and in line with the
downturn in farm income, farmland prices are coming under pressure.

We have been and will continue to be proactive in looking for signs of deterioration within the loan portfolio in an effort to manage credit
quality and work with borrowers where possible to mitigate losses. As of December 31, 2019, there were $33.8 million in classified loans of which
$7.3 million related to agricultural real estate, $13.2 million to commercial and industrial loans, $4.7 million to real estate owner occupied, $4.3
million to agricultural production, $1.6 million to real estate construction, and $1.1 million to commercial real estate. This compares to $28.4
million in classified loans as of December 31, 2018 of which $19.2 million related to agricultural real estate, $3.0 million to real estate construction,
$2.6 million to commercial and industrial, $1.1 million to commercial real estate, and $0.9 million to real estate owner occupied.
As of December 31, 2019, we believe, based on all current and available information, the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb
probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio; however, no assurance can be given that we may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of
the allowance in any given period. Refer to “Allowance for Credit Losses” below for further information.
Net Interest Income after Provision for Credit Losses
Net interest income, after the provision for credit losses was $62,747,000 for 2019 compared to $62,653,000 and $57,389,000 for 2018 and
2017, respectively.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income is comprised of customer service charges, gains on sales and calls of investment securities, income from appreciation in
cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, loan placement fees, Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, and other income. Non-interest
income was $13,305,000 in 2019 compared to $10,324,000 and $10,836,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $2,981,000 or 28.87% increase in
non-interest income in 2019 resulted primarily from increases in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities, loan placement fees,
appreciation in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, partially offset by a decrease in service charge income, net gain on the sale of
the Company’s credit card portfolio, interchange fees, and Federal Home Loan Bank dividends compared to 2018. The $512,000 or 4.72% decrease
in non-interest income in 2018 resulted primarily from decreases in net realized gains on sales and calls of investment securities and service charge
income, partially offset by a increase in loan placement fees, net gain on the sale of the Company’s credit card portfolio, interchange fees,
appreciation in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, and Federal Home Loan Bank dividends compared to 2017.
Customer service charges decreased $230,000 to $2,756,000 in 2019 compared to $2,986,000 in 2018 and $3,053,000 in 2017. The
decreases in 2019 and 2018 resulted from decreases in our NSF fees and lower analysis service charge income.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we realized net gains on sales and calls of investment securities of $5,199,000, compared to
$1,314,000 in 2018 and $2,802,000 in 2017. The net gains in 2019, 2018, and 2017 were the results of partial restructuring of the investment
portfolio designed to improve the future performance of the portfolio. See Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail.
Income from the appreciation in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (BOLI) totaled $728,000 in 2019 compared to $695,000
and $621,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Bank’s salary continuation and deferred compensation plans and the related BOLI are used as
retention tools for directors and key executives of the Bank.
Interchange fees totaled $1,446,000 in 2019 compared to $1,462,000 and $1,458,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Part of the increases
in 2018 and 2017 was attributable to the FLB and SVB acquisitions.
We earn loan placement fees from the brokerage of single-family residential mortgage loans provided for the convenience of our customers.
Loan placement fees increased $270,000 in 2019 to $978,000 compared to $708,000 in 2018 and $706,000 in 2017.
The Bank holds stock from the Federal Home Loan Bank in relationship with its borrowing capacity and generally receives quarterly
dividends. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held FHLB stock totaling $6,062,000 and $6,843,000, respectively. Dividends in 2019
decreased to $455,000 compared to $590,000 in 2018 and $443,000 in 2017.
Other income decreased to $1,743,000 in 2019 compared to $2,107,000 and $1,753,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. A net gain of
$462,000 on the sale of the Company’s credit card portfolio was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Non-Interest Expenses
Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, regulatory assessments, acquisition and integration-related expenses, data
processing expenses, ATM/Debit card expenses, license and maintenance contract expenses, information technology, and professional services
(consisting of audit, accounting, consulting and legal fees) are the major categories of non-interest expenses. Non-interest expenses increased
$1,032,000 or 2.29% to $46,100,000 in 2019 compared to $45,068,000 in 2018, and $44,406,000 in 2017.

Our efficiency ratio, measured as the percentage of non-interest expenses (exclusive of amortization of core deposit intangibles, other real
estate owned, and repossessed asset expenses) to net interest income before provision for credit losses plus non-interest income (exclusive of
realized gains or losses on sale and calls of investments) was 62.77% for 2019 compared to 61.23% for 2018 and 62.03% for 2017. The slight
increase in the efficiency ratio in 2019 and 2018 is due to the growth in non-interest expense outpacing the growth in revenues.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $433,000 or 1.65% to $26,654,000 in 2019 compared to $26,221,000 in 2018 and $24,738,000 in
2017. Full time equivalents were 281 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 316 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase
in salaries and employee benefits in 2019 compared to 2018 is a result of normal cycles and salary increases and higher deferred compensation
interest expense, offset by a decrease of full time equivalent employees and lower compensation expense.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the compensation cost recognized for share based compensation was $555,000,
$482,000 and $384,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, there was $490,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under all plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.57
years. See Notes 1 and 15 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. No options to purchase shares of the Company’s
common stock were issued during the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018. Restricted common stock awards of 25,420 and 22,204 shares
were awarded in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Occupancy and equipment expense decreased $533,000 or 8.92% to $5,439,000 in 2019 compared to $5,972,000 in 2018 and $5,186,000 in
2017. The Company made no changes in its depreciation expense methodology.
Regulatory assessments were $251,000 in 2019 compared to $619,000 and $652,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The assessment base
for calculating the amount owed is average assets minus average tangible equity. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the FDIC approved a final
rule revising DIF assessment formulas which resulted in lower assessments for the Company. 2017 and 2016 were higher as compared to 2018 due
to the additional assessments on the acquired institutions.
Data processing expenses were $1,557,000 in 2019 compared to $1,666,000 in 2018 and $1,740,000 in 2017. The $109,000 or 6.54%
decrease in 2019 is from the consolidation of processes after the conversion of the acquired institutions was completed in 2018. No acquisition and
integration expenses related to the FLB and SVB mergers was recorded in 2019 compared to $217,000 in 2018 and $1,828,000 in 2017.
Professional services decreased $170,000 in 2019 compared to 2018.
Amortization of core deposit intangibles was $695,000 for 2019, $455,000 for 2018, and $234,000 for 2017. During 2019, amortization
expense related to FLB core deposit intangible (CDI) was $423,000, amortization expense related to SVB core deposit intangible (CDI) was
$135,000, and amortization expense related to VCB CDI was $137,000. During 2018, amortization expense related to FLB CDI was $247,000, SVB
CDI was $72,000 and amortization expense related to VCB CDI was $136,000. During 2017, amortization expense related to FLB CDI was $47,000,
amortization expense related to SVB CDI was $50,000, and amortization expense related to VCB CDI was $137,000.
ATM/Debit card expenses increased $181,000 to $920,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $739,000 in 2018 and
$750,000 in 2017. Information technology expenses increased $1,498,000 to $2,611,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to
$1,113,000 and $818,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the information technology expenses was a result of the Company
outsourcing its network maintenance and IT support during the fourth quarter of 2018. Other non-interest expenses decreased $250,000 or 5.39%
to $4,386,000 in 2019 compared to $4,636,000 in 2018 and $5,011,000 in 2017.

Provision for Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate was 28.4% for 2019 compared to 23.7% for 2018 and 41.1% for 2017. The Company reported an income tax
provision of $8,509,000, $6,620,000, and $9,793,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. With the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (the “Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company’s federal income tax rate changed from 35% to 21% effective as of the beginning
of 2018. The decrease in the 2018 effective tax rate was the result of the change in the federal rate offset by a sizable decrease in tax exempt
interest. As a result of the enactment of the Act the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred taxes was adjusted as of December 31, 2017
to reflect the 2018 tax rates (the rates at which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse). The change to the tax rates (including the rate
change applied to deferred taxes reflected in other comprehensive income and certain tax-advantaged investments as reflected in other assets)
resulted in an increase to the Company’s tax provision of $3,535,000 in 2017. As part of the Act for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017,
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards are refundable and are expected to be fully refunded by 2022. As such, they are not dependent on
future taxable income to be realized and have been classified as an other receivable.
Some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting
principles leading to timing differences between the Company’s actual tax liability, and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income.
These temporary differences comprise the “deferred” portion of the Company’s tax expense or benefit, which is accumulated on the Company’s
books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse.
Realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the Company generating sufficient future taxable income to
obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and the utilization of tax credit carryforwards and the net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to
adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income. Under generally accepted accounting principles a valuation allowance is
required to be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the realization of the
deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence,
including forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and
business conditions.
The Company had the net deferred tax assets of $8.74 million and $11.183 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. After
consideration of the matters in the preceding paragraph, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2019 and 2018 will be fully realized in future years.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Summary of Changes in Consolidated Balance Sheets
Total assets were $1,596,755,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1,537,836,000 as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 3.83% or
$58,919,000. Total gross loans were $943,380,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $918,695,000 as of December 31, 2018, an increase of
$24,685,000 or 2.69%. The total investment portfolio (including Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits in other banks) increased 6.00%
or $28,665,000 to $506,597,000. Total deposits increased 3.98% or $50,987,000 to $1,333,285,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to
$1,282,298,000 as of December 31, 2018. Shareholders’ equity increased $8,390,000 or 3.82% to $228,128,000 as of December 31, 2019,
compared to $219,738,000 as of December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders’ equity was driven by the retention of earnings, net of dividends
paid, and an increase in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) securities recorded, net of estimated taxes, in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI). Accrued interest payable and other liabilities were $30,187,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $20,645,000
as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $9,542,000.
Fair Value
The Company measures the fair value of its financial instruments utilizing a hierarchical framework associated with the level of observable
pricing scenarios utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial
instruments generally correlates to the level of the observable pricing scenario. Financial instruments with readily available actively quoted prices
or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of observable pricing and a lesser degree of
judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no observable
pricing and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Observable pricing scenarios are impacted by a number of factors,
including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics
specific to the transaction.
See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated
with financial instruments carried at fair value.

Corporate debt securities 9,000 — —
Total Available-for-Sale Securities $ 466,747 $ 470,162 $ 531,192
Our investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies collateralized by mortgage backed
obligations and obligations of states and political subdivision securities and are classified at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. As of December 31, 2019, investment securities with a fair value of $91,677,000, or 19.47% of our investment securities portfolio, were
held as collateral for public funds, short and long-term borrowings, treasury, tax, and for other purposes. Our investment policies are established
by the Board of Directors and implemented by our Investment/Asset Liability Committee. They are designed primarily to provide and maintain
liquidity, to enable us to meet our pledging requirements for public money and borrowing arrangements, to generate a favorable return on
investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to complement our lending activities.
Our investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets is generally higher than our peers due primarily to our comparatively low loan-to-
deposit ratio. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at December 31, 2019 was 70.76% compared to 71.64% at December 31, 2018. The loan to deposit ratio of
our peers was 82.00% at December 31, 2019. Peer group information from S&P Global Market Intelligence data includes bank holding companies
in central California with assets from $600 million to $3.5 billion. The total investment portfolio, including Federal funds sold and interest-earning
deposits in other

banks, increased 6.00% or $28,665,000 to $506,597,000 at December 31, 2019, from $477,932,000 at December 31, 2018. The market value of the
portfolio reflected an unrealized gain of $3,999,000 at December 31, 2019, compared to an unrealized loss of $6,257,000 at December 31, 2018.
Losses recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017 were incurred in order to reposition the investment securities portfolio based on the current rate
environment. The securities which were sold at a loss were acquired when the rate environment was not as volatile. The securities which were
sold were primarily purchased strategically several years ago in view of the rate environment at that time. The Company is addressing risks in the
security portfolio by selling these securities and using proceeds to purchase securities that meet the Company’s current risk profile.
We periodically evaluate each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment, relying primarily on industry analyst reports,
observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations. The portion of the impairment that is attributable to a shortage in the present value
of expected future cash flows relative to the amortized cost should be recorded as a current period charge to earnings. The discount rate in this
analysis is the original yield expected at time of purchase.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company performed an analysis of the investment portfolio to determine whether any of the investments held
in the portfolio had an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Management evaluated all investment securities with an unrealized loss at
December 31, 2019, and identified those that had an unrealized loss for at least a consecutive 12 month period, which had an unrealized loss at
December 31, 2019 greater than 10% of the recorded book value on that date, or which had an unrealized loss of more than $10,000. Management
also analyzed any securities that may have been downgraded by credit rating agencies.
For those bonds that met the evaluation criteria, management obtained and reviewed the most recently published national credit ratings for
those bonds. For those bonds that were obligations of states and political subdivisions with an investment grade rating by the rating agencies,
management also evaluated the financial condition of the municipality and any applicable municipal bond insurance provider and concluded that no
credit related impairment existed. There were no OTTI losses recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of 41 private label mortgage backed securities (PLMBS) with a remaining principal balance
of $155,308,000 and a net unrealized gain of approximately $4,070,000. Seven of these PLMBS with a remaining principal balance of $1,593,000
had credit ratings below investment grade. The Company continues to monitor these securities for changes in credit ratings or other indications of
credit deterioration. No credit related OTTI charges related to PLMBS were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31,
2018.
The amortized cost, maturities and weighted average yield of investment securities at December 31, 2019 are summarized in the following

At December 31, 2019, loans acquired in the FLB, SVB and VCB acquisitions had a balance of $152,735,000, of which $4,009,000 were
commercial loans, $130,656,000 were real estate loans, and $18,070,000 were consumer loans, and at December 31, 2018, the acquired loans
acquired had a balance of $189,719,000, of which $5,875,000 were commercial loans, $158,025,000 were real estate loans, and $25,819,000 were
consumer loans.
At December 31, 2019, in management’s judgment, a concentration of loans existed in commercial loans and real-estate-related loans,
representing approximately 95.5% of total loans of which 13.5% were commercial and 82.0% were real-estate-related. This level of concentration
is consistent with 95.8% at December 31, 2018. Although we believe the loans within this concentration have no more than the normal risk of
collectability, a substantial decline in the performance of the economy in general or a decline in real estate values in our primary market areas, in
particular, could have an adverse impact on collectability, increase the level of real estate-related nonperforming loans, or have other adverse
effects which alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. The Company was not involved in any sub-prime mortgage lending activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
We believe that our commercial real estate loan underwriting policies and practices result in prudent extensions of credit, but recognize
that our lending activities result in relatively high reported commercial real estate lending levels. Commercial real estate loans include certain
loans which represent low to moderate risk and certain loans with higher risks.
The Board of Directors review and approve concentration limits and exceptions to limitations of concentration are reported to the Board of
Directors at least quarterly.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (OREO), and repossessed assets. Nonperforming loans are
those loans which have (i) been placed on nonaccrual status; (ii) been classified as doubtful under our asset classification system; or (iii) become
contractually past due 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest and have not been restructured or otherwise placed on nonaccrual
status. A loan is classified as nonaccrual when 1) it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower;
2) payment in full of principal or interest under the original contractual terms is not expected; or 3) principal or interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status
for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows.
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on
loans. Interest income from nonaccrual loans is recorded only if collection of principal in full is not in doubt and when cash payments, if any, are
received.
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and any accrued but unpaid interest income is reversed and charged against income when the
payment of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due. Loans in the nonaccrual category are treated as nonaccrual loans even though we
may ultimately recover all or a portion of the interest due. These loans return to accrual status when the loan becomes contractually current,
future collectability of amounts due is reasonably assured, and a minimum of six months of satisfactory principal repayment performance has
occurred. See Note 5 of the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
At December 31, 2019, total nonperforming assets totaled $1,693,000, or 0.11% of total assets, compared to $2,740,000, or 0.18% of total
assets at December 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets totaled 0.18% of gross loans as of December 31, 2019 and 0.30% of gross loans as of
December 31, 2018. Total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019, included nonaccrual loans totaling $1,693,000, no OREO, and no
repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2018 consisted of $2,740,000 in nonaccrual loans, no OREO, and no repossessed assets.
At December 31, 2019, we had one loan considered a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) totaling $322,000 which is included in nonaccrual loans
compared to one TDR totaling $50,000 at December 31, 2018. We have no outstanding commitments to lend additional funds to any of these
borrowers. See Note 5 of the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report concerning our recorded
investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized.
A summary of nonaccrual, restructured, and past due loans at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is set forth below. The
Company had no loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing interest at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Management is not aware of any
potential problem loans, which were current and accruing at December 31, 2019, where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to
comply with the present repayment terms. Management can give no assurance that nonaccrual and other nonperforming loans will not increase in
the future.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had impaired loans totaling $3,734,000 and $5,909,000, respectively. We measure our impaired
loans by using the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan’s original contractual interest rate if the loan is not collateral dependent. Impaired loans are identified from internal credit review
reports, past due reports, overdraft listings, and third party reports of examination. Borrowers experiencing problems such as operating losses,
marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow or business interruptions which jeopardize collection of the loan are also reviewed for possible
impairment classification. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement. Factors
considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled
principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified
as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all
of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior
payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans determined to be impaired are individually
evaluated for impairment. When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan’s observable
market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is
expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. For collateral dependent loans secured by real estate, we obtain external appraisals
which are updated at least annually to determine the fair value of the collateral, and we record an immediate charge-off for the difference between
the book value of the loan and the appraised value less selling costs of the collateral. We perform quarterly internal reviews on substandard loans.
We place loans on nonaccrual status and classify them as impaired when it becomes probable that we will not receive interest and principal
under the original contractual terms, or when loans are delinquent 90 days or more, unless the
45

loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower
(less than 30 days delinquent) on nonaccrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in
future periods. Foregone interest on nonaccrual loans totaled $85,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 of which none was attributable to
troubled debt restructurings. Foregone interest on nonaccrual loans totaled $267,000 and $210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively of which $4,000 and $17,000 was attributable to troubled debt restructurings, respectively.

OREO represents real property taken either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. OREO is carried at
the lesser of cost or fair market value less selling costs. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Bank had no OREO properties. The
Company held no repossessed assets at December 31, 2019 or at December 31, 2018, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets.
As of December 31, 2017 the Bank had no OREO properties. The carrying vale of foreclosed assets was $70,000 at December 31, 2017.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We have established a methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses made up of general and specific
allocations. The methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for an overall allowance for credit losses as well
as specific allowances that are tied to individual loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the
Company’s loan portfolio. The allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for
probable incurred losses related to loans that are not impaired.
For all portfolio segments, the determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by
management including, but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment (and in certain cases peer loss data) over the most
recent 20 quarters, and qualitative factors including economic trends in the Company’s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic
concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company’s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses incurred
in the portfolio taken as a whole. Management has determined that the most recent 20 quarters was an appropriate look-back period based on
several factors including the current global economic uncertainty and various national and local economic indicators, and a time period sufficient to
capture enough data due to the size of the portfolio to produce statistically accurate historical loss calculations. We believe this period is an
appropriate look-back period.
In originating loans, we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of
loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan,
the quality of the collateral securing the loan. The allowance is increased by provisions charged against earnings and recoveries, and reduced by
net loan charge-offs. Loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible, or partially charged off when portions of a loan are deemed
to be uncollectible. Recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received.
The allowance for credit losses is maintained to cover probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. The responsibility for the review
of our assets and the determination of the adequacy lies with management and our Audit/
46

Table of Contents
Compliance Committee. They delegate the authority to the Chief Credit Officer (CCO) to determine the loss reserve ratio for each type of asset and
to review, at least quarterly, the adequacy of the allowance based on an evaluation of the portfolio, past experience, prevailing market conditions,
amount of government guarantees, concentration in loan types and other relevant factors.
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the probable incurred credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is based
on principles of accounting: (1) losses accrued for on loans when they are probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated and (2) losses
accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary
market and the loan balance.
Management adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of
problem assets and adequate valuation allowances to cover probable incurred losses. The Bank’s asset monitoring process includes the use of
asset classifications to segregate the assets, largely loans and real estate, into various risk categories. The Bank uses the various asset
classifications as a means of measuring risk and determining the adequacy of valuation allowances by using a nine-grade system to classify assets.
In general, all credit facilities exceeding 90 days of delinquency require classification and are placed on nonaccrual.
The following table summarizes the Company’s loan loss experience, as well as provisions and recoveries (charge-offs) to the allowance and
certain pertinent ratios for the periods indicated:

Managing credits identified through the risk evaluation methodology includes developing a business strategy with the customer to mitigate
our losses. Our management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when, and to what extent, additional
provisions may be necessary.
The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank’s and our Board of Directors’ Audit/Compliance Committee.
Reserves are allocated to loan portfolio segments using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as delinquencies and
losses and predictive risk elements such as economic, competitive and environmental factors. We have adopted the specific reserve approach to
allocate reserves to each impaired asset for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure. Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated
to various portfolio categories, it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety. Additions may be required based on the
47

Table of Contents
results of independent loan portfolio examinations, regulatory agency examinations, or our own internal review process. Additions are also
required when, in management’s judgment, the reserve does not properly reflect the potential loss exposure.

Loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loans are deemed uncollectible. It is the policy of management to make
additions to the allowance so that it remains adequate to cover all probable loan charge-offs that exist in the portfolio at that time. We assign
qualitative and environmental factors (Q factors) to each loan category. Q factors include reserves held for the effects of lending policies, economic
trends, and portfolio trends along with other dynamics which may cause additional stress to the portfolio.
As of December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses (ALLL) was $9,130,000, compared to $9,104,000 at December 31, 2018, a net
increase of $26,000. The increase in the ALLL was due to a provision for credit losses, offset by net charge-offs. during the year ended
December 31, 2019 which was necessitated by management’s observations and assumptions about the existing credit quality of the loan portfolio.
Net charge-offs totaled $999,000 while the provision for credit losses was $1,025,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The balance of
classified loans and loans graded special mention, totaled $33,838,000 and $28,183,000 at December 31, 2019 and $28,394,000 and $26,254,000
at December 31, 2018, respectively. The balance of undisbursed commitments to extend credit on construction and other loans and letters of credit
was $291,182,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $312,274,000 as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of a
contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations was $250,000 and $225,000, respectively. The contingent
allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations is calculated by management using an appropriate, systematic, and
consistently applied process. While related to credit losses, this allocation is not a part of ALLL and is considered separately as a liability for
accounting and regulatory reporting purposes. Risks and uncertainties exist in all lending transactions and our management and Directors’ Loan
Committee have established reserve levels based on economic uncertainties and other risks that exist as of each reporting period.
The ALLL as a percentage of total loans was 0.97% at December 31, 2019, and 0.99% at December 31, 2018. Total loans include FLB, SVB
and VCB loans that were recorded at fair value in connection with the acquisitions of $152,735,000 at December 31, 2019 and $189,719,000 at
December 31, 2018. Excluding these acquired loans from the calculation, the ALLL to total gross loans was 1.15% and 1.25% as of December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively, and general reserves associated with non-impaired loans to total non-impaired loans was 1.16% and 1.25%,
respectively. The loan portfolio acquired in the mergers was booked at fair value with no associated allocation in the ALLL. The size of the fair
value discount remains adequate for all non-impaired acquired loans; therefore, there is no associated allocation in the ALLL.
The Company’s loan portfolio balances in 2019 increased from 2018 through organic growth. Management believes that the change in the
allowance for credit losses to total loans ratios is consistent with the composition of loans and the level
48

Table of Contents
of nonperforming and classified loans, partially offset by the general economic conditions experienced in the central California communities
serviced by the Company and recent improvements in real estate collateral values.
Assumptions regarding the collateral value of various under-performing loans may affect the level and allocation of the allowance for credit
losses in future periods. The allowance may also be affected by trends in the amount of charge-offs experienced or expected trends within different
loan portfolios. However, the total reserve rates on non-impaired loans include qualitative factors which are systematically derived and consistently
applied to reflect conservatively estimated losses from loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Based on the above considerations
and given recent changes in historical charge-off rates included in the ALLL modeling and the changes in other factors, management determined
that the ALLL was appropriate as of December 31, 2019.
Non-performing loans totaled $1,693,000 as of December 31, 2019, and $2,740,000 as of December 31, 2018. The allowance for credit
losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 539.28% and 332.26% as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In
addition, management believes that the likelihood of recoveries on previously charged-off loans continues to improve based on the collection efforts
of management combined with improvements in the value of real estate which serves as the primary source of collateral for loans. Management
believes the allowance at December 31, 2019 is adequate based upon its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss trends and other
factors. However, no assurance can be given that the Company may not sustain charge-offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given
period.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Business combinations involving the Bank’s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise give rise to goodwill. Total
goodwill at December 31, 2019 was $53,777,000 consisting of $13,466,000, $10,394,000, $6,340,000, $14,643,000 and $8,934,000 representing
the excess of the cost of Folsom Lake Bank, Sierra Vista Bank, Visalia Community Bank, Service 1st Bancorp, and Bank of Madera County,
respectively, over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Bank’s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisitions and is not
deductible for tax purposes. A significant decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in
impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment.
The Company has selected September 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Management assessed qualitative factors
including performance trends and noted no factors indicating goodwill impairment.
Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances arose during the fourth quarter of 2019;
therefore, goodwill was not required to be retested.
The intangible assets at December 31, 2019 represent the estimated fair value of the core deposit relationships acquired in the 2017
acquisition of Folsom Lake Bank of $1,879,000, the 2016 acquisition of Sierra Vista Bank of $508,000 and the 2013 acquisition of Visalia
Community Bank of $1,365,000. Core deposit intangibles are being amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of five to ten
years from the date of acquisition. The carrying value of intangible assets at December 31, 2019 was $1,878,000, net of $1,874,000 in accumulated
amortization expense. The carrying value at December 31, 2018 was $2,572,000, net of $1,180,000 in accumulated amortization expense.
Management evaluates the remaining useful lives quarterly to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining
periods of amortization. Based on the evaluation, no changes to the remaining useful lives was required. Management performed an annual
impairment test on core deposit intangibles as of September 30, 2019 and determined no impairment was necessary. In addition, management
determined that no events had occurred between the annual evaluation date and December 31, 2019 which would necessitate further analysis.
Amortization expense recognized was $695,000 for 2019, $455,000 for 2018 and $234,000 for 2017.

accounts at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest bearing transactions accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the
standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 for each deposit insurance ownership category.
Total deposits increased $50,987,000 or 3.98% to $1,333,285,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $1,282,298,000 as of

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco advances. As of December 31,
2018, the Company had $10,000,000 short-term or long-term FHLB borrowings. We maintain a line of credit with the FHLB collateralized by
government securities and loans. Refer to Liquidity section below for further discussion of FHLB advances. The Bank had unsecured lines of credit
with its correspondent banks which, in the aggregate, amounted to $70,000,000 and $40,000,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, at
interest rates which vary with market conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no overnight borrowings outstanding under
these credit facilities.
Capital Resources
Capital serves as a source of funds and helps protect depositors and shareholders against potential losses. Historically, the primary sources
of capital for the Company have been internally generated capital through retained earnings and the issuance of common and preferred stock.
The Company has historically maintained substantial levels of capital. The assessment of capital adequacy is dependent on several factors
including asset quality, earnings trends, liquidity and economic conditions. Maintenance of adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability
to the Company. The Company needs to maintain substantial levels of regulatory capital to give it maximum flexibility in the changing regulatory
environment and to respond to changes in the market and economic conditions.
Our shareholders’ equity was $228,128,000 as of December 31, 2019, compared to $219,738,000 as of December 31, 2018. The increase in
shareholders’ equity is the result of an increase in retained earnings from our net income of $21,443,000, the exercise of stock options, including
the related tax benefit of $276,000, the effect of share-based compensation expense of $555,000, stock issued under employee stock purchase plan
of $216,000, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $7,224,000, offset by payment of common stock cash dividends
of $5,805,000 and repurchase and retirement of common stock of $15,619,000.
During 2019, the Bank declared and paid cash dividends to the Company in the amount of $20,100,000 in connection with the cash
dividends to the Company’s shareholders approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company declared and paid a total of $5,805,000 or

Management considers capital requirements as part of its strategic planning process. The strategic plan calls for continuing increases in
assets and liabilities, and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings. The ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the
capital markets as well as our performance. Management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet its strategic
objectives.
The Board of Governors, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to
provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions
reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-
sheet items.

The Company succeeded to all of the rights and obligations of the Service 1st Capital Trust I, a Delaware business trust, in connection with
the acquisition of Service 1st as of November 12, 2008. The Trust was formed on August 17, 2006 for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred
securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Service 1st. Under applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust preferred securities that
is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to 25% of the Company’s Tier 1 capital on a pro forma basis. At December 31, 2019, all of the trust preferred
securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital. The trust preferred securities mature on October 7, 2036, are redeemable at the
Company’s option beginning five years after issuance, and require quarterly distributions by the Trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities
at a variable interest rate which will adjust quarterly to equal the three month LIBOR plus 1.60%.

Table of Contents
The Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities to purchase approximately $5,155,000 in aggregate principal
amount of Service 1st’s junior subordinated notes (the Notes). The Notes bear interest at the same variable interest rate during the same quarterly
periods as the trust preferred securities. The Notes are redeemable by the Company on any January 7, April 7, July 7, or October 7 on or after
October 7, 2012 or at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of certain events, such as: (i) a change in the regulatory capital treatment of
the Notes (ii) in the event the Trust is deemed an investment company or (iii) upon the occurrence of certain adverse tax events. In each such case,
the Company may redeem the Notes for their aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest.
The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable at the election of the trustee or holders of 25% of the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Notes in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of any interest following the nonpayment of any such interest for 20 or
more consecutive quarterly periods. Holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled to a cumulative cash distribution on the liquidation
amount of $1,000 per security. For each January 7, April 7, July 7 or October 7 of each year, the rate will be adjusted to equal the three month
LIBOR plus 1.60%. As of December 31, 2019, the rate was 3.59%. Interest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31,
2019, 2018, and 2017 was $210,000, $199,000 and $147,000, respectively.
LIQUIDITY
Liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily
operations, which include funding of securities purchases, providing for customers’ credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings. Our
liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by our management and Directors’ Asset/Liability Committees. This process
is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs, including adequate cash flows for off-balance sheet commitments.
Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and, to a lesser extent,
broker deposits, Federal funds facilities and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). These funding sources are
augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans, the routine maturities and pay downs of securities from the securities portfolio, the
stability of our core deposits and the ability to sell investment securities. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had unpledged securities totaling
$386,541,000 available as a secondary source of liquidity and total cash and cash equivalents of $52,574,000. Cash and cash equivalents at
December 31, 2019 increased 65.71% compared to December 31, 2018. Primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on
deposits, origination and purchases of loans, purchases of investment securities, and payment of operating expenses.
To augment our liquidity, we have established Federal funds lines with various correspondent banks. At December 31, 2019, our available
borrowing capacity includes approximately $70,000,000 in Federal funds lines with our correspondent banks and $304,987,000 in unused FHLB
advances. At December 31, 2019, we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity
position.

The liquidity of our parent company, Central Valley Community Bancorp, is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its
subsidiary, Central Valley Community Bank, subject to limitations imposed by state and federal regulations.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments
include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they
are funded or related fees are incurred or received. The balance of commitments to extend credit on undisbursed construction and other loans and
letters of credit was $291,182,000 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $312,274,000 as of December 31, 2018. For a more detailed discussion of
these financial instruments, see Note 13 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
Contractual Obligations
The contractual obligations of the Company, summarized by type of obligation and contractual maturity, at December 31, 2019, are as
follows:
Less Than One One to Three Three to Five
(In thousands) Year Years Years After Five Years Total

Total $ 1,319,522 $ 16,922 $ 4,603 $ 8,850 $ 1,349,897
Deposits represent both non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits. Interest bearing deposits include interest bearing transaction
accounts, money market and savings deposits and certificates of deposit. Deposits with indeterminate maturities, such as demand, savings and
money market accounts are reflected as obligations due in less than one year.
Subordinated notes issued to a capital trust which was formed solely for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. These
subordinated notes were acquired as a part of the merger with Service 1st. The aggregate amount indicated above represents the full amount of the
contractual obligation. All of these securities are variable rate instruments. The trust preferred securities mature on October 7, 2036, and are
redeemable quarterly at the Company’s option.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is party to various operating leases. For operating leases, the dollar balances reflected in
the table above are categorized by the due date of the lease payments. Operating leases represent the total minimum lease payments under non-
cancelable operating leases.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and
expense in the financial statements. Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, involve the application of highly sensitive and
judgmental estimates and assumptions. Some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are highly complex and contain inherent
uncertainties. It is possible that, in some instances, different estimates and assumptions could reasonably have been made and used by
management, instead of those we applied, which might have produced different results that could have had a material effect on the financial
statements.
We have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that, due to the inherent judgments and assumptions and the potential
sensitivity of the financial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to an understanding of our financial statements. We believe
that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements are appropriate. For a further
description of our accounting policies, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the financial statements included in this
Form 10‑K.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Allowance for Credit Losses
Our allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Loans are charged off against the allowance
when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for
credit losses. Management’s methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements, which include specific allowances
on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risks. The allowance is only an estimate of the
inherent loss in the loan portfolio and may not represent actual losses realized over time, either of losses in excess of the allowance or of losses less
than the allowance. Our accounting for estimated loan losses is discussed and disclosed primarily in Note 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial
statements under the heading “Allowance for Credit Losses” .
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. This fair value may differ from the cost basis
recorded on the acquired institution’s financial statements. Management performs an initial assessment to determine which assets and liabilities
must be designated for fair value analysis. Management typically engages experts in the field of valuation to perform the valuation of significant
assets and liabilities and, after assessing the resulting fair value computation, will utilize such value in computing the initial purchase accounting
adjustments for the acquired assets. It is possible that these values could be viewed differently through alternative valuation approaches or if
performed by different experts. Management is responsible for determining that the values derived by experts are reasonable. Any excess of the
purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as
goodwill. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment during the first twelve months after the acquisition
date if additional information becomes available to indicate a more accurate or appropriate value for an asset or liability. See Note 1 - under the
heading “Business Combinations”, and Note 7- Goodwill and Intangible Assets in the financial statements in this Form 10‑K.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as
changes in economic or market conditions, indicate that impairment may exist. When required, the goodwill impairment test involves a two-step
process. The first test for goodwill impairment is done by comparing the reporting unit’s aggregate fair value to its carrying value. Absent other
indicators of impairment, if the aggregate fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no additional analysis is
necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed the aggregate fair value, a second test would be performed to measure the
amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure any impairment loss, the implied fair value would be determined in the same manner as if the
reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment
charge would be recorded for the difference.
During 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350). Under the ASU, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is
more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Thus, before the first step of goodwill impairment, the entity has the option
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that the fair value of
goodwill is less than carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, macroeconomic and State of California economic
conditions, industry and market conditions and trends, the Company’s financial performance, market capitalization, stock price, and any Company-
specific events relevant to the assessment. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than
not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step process is unnecessary. As of December 31,
2019, based on our qualitative assessment, there were no reporting units where we believed that it was more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, we had no reporting units where there was a reasonable possibility
of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
See Note 7“Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in the financial statements in this Form 10‑K for further discussion.
INFLATION
The impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on other industries primarily because the assets and
liabilities of financial institutions consist largely of monetary items. However, financial institutions are affected by inflation in part through non-
interest expenses, such as salaries and occupancy expenses, and to some extent by changes in interest rates.
55

Table of Contents
At December 31, 2019, we do not believe that inflation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. However, if inflation concerns cause short term rates to rise in the near future, we may benefit by immediate repricing of a portion of
our loan portfolio. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest rate risk (IRR) and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions that operate
like we do. IRR represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon our net interest income
(NII). Changes in the NII are the result of changes in the net interest spread between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (timing
risk), the relationship between various rates (basis risk), and changes in the shape of the yield curve.
We realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans, investments, other interest-earning
assets and the interest incurred on deposits and borrowings. The volumes and yields on loans, deposits and borrowings are affected by market
interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, 68.59% of our loan portfolio was tied to adjustable-rate indices. The majority of our adjustable rate loans
are tied to prime and reprice within 90 days. Several of our loans, tied to prime, are at their floors and will not reprice until prime plus the factor is
greater than the floor. The majority of our time deposits have a fixed rate of interest. As of December 31, 2019, 83.93% of our time deposits
mature within one year or less.
Changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect our interest spread, and therefore profitability. Sharp and
significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term, principally because of the
timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities (and therefore repricing) of the deposits and borrowings.
Our management and Board of Directors’ Asset/Liability Committees (ALCO) are responsible for managing our assets and liabilities in a
manner that balances profitability, IRR and various other risks including liquidity. The ALCO operates under policies and within risk limits
prescribed, reviewed, and approved by the Board of Directors.
The ALCO seeks to stabilize our NII by matching rate-sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these
assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment. When the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds rate-sensitive
assets within specified time periods, NII generally will be negatively impacted by an increasing interest rate environment and positively impacted
by a decreasing interest rate environment. Conversely, when the amount of rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities
within specified time periods, net interest income will generally be positively impacted by an increasing interest rate environment and negatively
impacted by a decreasing interest rate environment. Our mix of assets consists primarily of loans and securities, none of which are held for trading
purposes. The value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk, which we must monitor and manage successfully in order to prevent declines
in value of these assets if interest rates rise in the future. The speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the
effects on our NII, as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors.
Simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes. Earnings simulations are
produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of our financial instruments and
incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments.
Interest rate simulations provide us with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in NII under various rate scenarios.
All assets and liabilities are normally subjected to up to 400 basis point increases and decreases in interest rates in 100 basis point increments.
Under each interest rate scenario, we project our net interest income. From these results, we can then develop alternatives in dealing with the
tolerance thresholds.
The assets and liabilities of a financial institution are primarily monetary in nature. As such they represent obligations to pay or receive
fixed and determinable amounts of money that are not affected by future changes in prices. Generally, the impact of inflation on a financial
institution is reflected by fluctuations in interest rates, the ability of customers to repay their obligations and upward pressure on operating
expenses. Although inflationary pressures are not considered to be of any particular hindrance in the current economic environment, they may have
an impact on the company’s future earnings in the event those pressures become more prevalent.
As a financial institution, the Company’s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will
ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities, and the
market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. Virtually all of
the Company’s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the Bank level. Thus, virtually all of the Company’s interest rate
risk exposure lies at the Bank level other than $5.2 million in subordinated notes issued by the Company’s subsidiary, Service 1st Capital Trust I. As
a result, all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the Bank level.
56

Table of Contents
The fundamental objective of the Company’s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the Company’s economic value while
maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable. Management believes an acceptable
degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities, pricing and mix to attempt to
neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest
income, which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets, such as loans and investments, and its interest expense on
interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning
assets re-price differently than its interest bearing liabilities. The Company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its
exposure to interest rate risk, ensuring adequate liquidity, and coordinating its sources and uses of funds.
The Company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range
of possible interest rate environments. The Company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure.
Management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results and believes that it can
continue to manage the short-term effects of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios.
Management employs asset and liability management software and engages consultants to measure the Company’s exposure to future
changes in interest rates. The software measures the expected cash flows and re-pricing of each financial asset/liability separately in measuring the
Company’s interest rate sensitivity. Based on the results of the software’s output, management believes the Company’s balance sheet is evenly
matched over the short term and slightly asset sensitive over the longer term as of December 31, 2019. This means that the Company would expect
(all other things being equal) to experience a limited change in its net interest income if rates rise or fall. The level of potential or expected change
indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the Company’s ALCO policies. Management will
continue to perform this analysis each quarter.
The hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the Company’s asset and liability balances are modeled quarterly.
The results of these models indicate how much of the Company’s net interest income is “at risk” from various rate changes over a one year horizon.
This exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures. Management believes the results for the Company’s December 31, 2019 balances indicate
that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a 100 basis points (“bps”), 200 bps, 300 bps, and 400 bps rate increase and a
100 bps decrease is acceptable to management and within policy guidelines at this time. Given the low interest rate environment, 200 bps, 300 bps,
and 400 bps decreases are not considered a realistic possibility and are therefore not modeled.
The results in the table below indicate the change in net interest income the Company would expect to see as of December 31, 2019, if
interest rates were to change in the amounts set forth:
Sensitivity Analysis of Impact of Rate Changes on Interest Income
Projected Net Interest $ Change from Rates at % Change from Rates at

Unchanged 62,100 — —
Down 100 bps 57,700 (4,400) (7.09)%
It is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary from any of the forecasted amounts
and such difference may be material and adverse. The forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions made by management, and that may turn
out to be different, and may change over time. Factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: 1) competitor
behavior, 2) economic conditions both locally and nationally, 3) actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board, 4) customer behavior and 5)
management’s responses to each of the foregoing. Factors that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have material and
adverse effects on the Company’s net interest income; therefore, the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future
results.

Approximately 68.59% of our loan portfolio is tied to adjustable rate indices and 30.52% of our loan portfolio reprices within 90 days. As of
December 31, 2019, we had 1,845 commercial and real estate loans totaling $537,446,000 with floors ranging from 3.75% to 7.50% and ceilings
ranging from 5.00% to 25.00%.

Assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, consequently, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the
impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency
of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies which might moderate the negative consequences of
interest rate deviations.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the

company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Central Valley Community Bancorp and Subsidiary
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General - Central Valley Community Bancorp (the “Company”) was incorporated on February 7, 2000 and subsequently obtained approval from the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to be a bank holding company in connection with its acquisition of Central Valley Community
Bank (the “Bank”). The Company became the sole shareholder of the Bank on November 15, 2000 in a statutory merger, pursuant to which each
outstanding share of the Bank’s common stock was exchanged for one share of common stock of the Company.
Service 1st Capital Trust I (the Trust) is a business trust formed by Service 1st for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. The
Company succeeded to all the rights and obligations of Service 1st in connection with the acquisition of Service 1st. The Trust is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.
The Bank operates 20 full service offices throughout California’s San Joaquin Valley and Greater Sacramento Region. The Bank’s primary
source of revenue is providing loans to customers who are predominately small and middle-market businesses and individuals.
The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to applicable legal limits. Depositors’ accounts
at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest bearing transactions accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the standard
maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 for each deposit insurance ownership category.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and the Bank conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and prevailing practices within the banking industry.
Management has determined that because all of the banking products and services offered by the Company are available in each branch of
the Bank, all branches are located within the same economic environment and management does not allocate resources based on the performance
of different lending or transaction activities, it is appropriate to aggregate the Bank branches and report them as a single operating segment. No
customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenues for the Company or the Bank.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the consolidated accounts of its
wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
For financial reporting purposes, Service 1st Capital Trust I, is a wholly-owned subsidiary acquired in the merger of Service 1st Bancorp and
formed for the exclusive purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of this trust (variable
interest entity), therefore the trust is not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as
a liability on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company’s investment in the common stock of the Trust is included in accrued
interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis,
management evaluates the estimates used. Estimates are based upon historical experience, current economic conditions and other factors that
management considers reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from
other sources, as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of contingencies and commitments. These estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash, due from banks with maturities less than 90 days, interest-
earning deposits in other banks, and Federal funds sold are considered to be cash equivalents. Generally, Federal funds are sold and purchased for
one-day periods. Net cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, and Federal
funds purchased.
Investment Securities - Investments are classified into the following categories:
• Available-for-sale securities, reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes,
as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity.
• Held-to-maturity securities, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, reported at amortized cost,
adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.
67

Table of Contents
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and may only change the classification in
certain limited circumstances. All transfers between categories are accounted for at fair value in the period which the transfer occurs. During the
year ended December 31, 2019, there were no transfers between categories.
Gains or losses on the sale of investment securities are computed on the specific identification method. Interest earned on investment
securities is reported in interest income, net of applicable adjustments for accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Premiums and
discounts on securities are amortized or accreted on the level yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage backed
securities where prepayments are anticipated.
An investment security is impaired when its carrying value is greater than its fair value. Investment securities that are impaired are
evaluated on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether
such a decline in their fair value is other than temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the
intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair
value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. The term “other than
temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not
necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, and management does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not
that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery, for debt securities, only the portion of the impairment loss representing
credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income. If management
intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost,
the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.
Loans - All loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at principal
balances outstanding net of deferred loan fees and costs, and the allowance for credit losses. Interest is accrued daily based upon outstanding loan
principal balances. However, when a loan becomes impaired and the future collectability of interest and principal is in serious doubt, the loan is
placed on nonaccrual status and the accrual of interest income is suspended. Any loan delinquent 90 days or more is automatically placed on
nonaccrual status. Any interest accrued but unpaid is charged against income. Subsequent payments on these loans, or payments received on
nonaccrual loans for which the ultimate collectability of principal is not in doubt, are applied first to principal until fully collected and then to
interest.
Interest income on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of
collection. Consumer and credit card loans are typically charged off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on the contractual
terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered
doubtful. A loan placed on non-accrual status may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due and unpaid, or
the loan otherwise becomes both well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is brought current, the Company must also have
reasonable assurance that the obligor has the ability to meet all contractual obligations in the future, that the loan will be repaid within a
reasonable period of time, and that a minimum of six months of satisfactory repayment performance has occurred.
Substantially all loan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchase premiums and discounts on loans are
deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, and amortized to interest income over the contractual term of the loan. The unamortized
balance of deferred fees and costs is reported as a component of net loans.
Acquired loans and Leases - Loans and leases acquired through purchase or through a business combination are recorded at their fair value at the
acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan and lease losses is not recorded
at the acquisition date. Should the Company’s allowance for credit losses methodology indicate that the credit discount associated with acquired,
non-purchased credit impaired loans, is no longer sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in those loans, the Company will establish an
allowance for those loans through a charge to provision for credit losses. At the time of an acquisition, we evaluate loans to determine if they are
purchase credit impaired loans. Purchased credit impaired loans are those acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration for which collection
of all contractual payments was not considered probable at the date of acquisition. This determination is made by considering past due and/or
nonaccrual status, prior designation of a troubled debt restructuring, or other factors that may suggest we will not be able to collect all contractual
payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value with the difference between fair value and estimated future cash
flows accreted over the expected cash flow period as income only to the extent we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future cash
flows. In this case, these loans would be classified as accruing. In the event we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future
cash flows, or if the loan is acquired primarily for the rewards of ownership of the underlying collateral, the loan is classified as non-accrual. An
acquired loan previously classified by the seller as a troubled debt restructuring is no longer classified as such at the date of acquisition. Past due
status is reported based on contractual payment status.
68

Table of Contents
All loans not otherwise classified as purchase credit impaired are recorded at fair value with the discount to contractual value accreted over
the life of the loan.
Allowance for Credit Losses - The allowance for credit losses (the “allowance”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses in the
Company’s loan portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the
allowance are made to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be
uncollectible are charged against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The
overall allowance consists of two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related
to loans that are not impaired.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement. Factors considered by management in
determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when
due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines
the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding
the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the
shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment. When a loan is
impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to come solely from the sale or operation of
underlying collateral.
A restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) if the Company for economic or legal reasons related to the
debtor’s financial difficulties grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. Restructured workout loans typically present
an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms. Loans that are reported as
TDRs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above.
When determining the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, we bifurcate the allowance between legacy loans and acquired loans.
Loans remain designated as acquired until either (i) loan is renewed or (ii) loan is substantially modified whereby modification results in a new
loan. When determining the allowance on acquired loans, the Company estimates probable incurred credit losses as compared to the Company’s
recorded investment, with the recorded investment being net of any unaccreted discounts from the acquisition.
The determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by management, including but not
limited to, consideration of a simple average of historical losses by portfolio segment (and in certain cases peer loss data) over the most recent 20
quarters, and qualitative factors including economic trends in the Company’s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic
concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company’s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent
in the portfolio taken as a whole.
The Company segregates the allowance by portfolio segment. These portfolio segments include commercial, real estate, and consumer
loans. The relative significance of risk considerations vary by portfolio segment. For commercial and real estate loans, the primary risk
consideration is a borrower’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to repay their loan. Secondary considerations include the creditworthiness of
guarantors and the valuation of collateral. In addition to the creditworthiness of a borrower, the type and location of real estate collateral is an
important risk factor for real estate loans. The primary risk considerations for consumer loans are a borrower’s personal cash flow and liquidity, as
well as collateral value. The allowance for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment, which includes both impaired loans and loans that
are not impaired, is combined to determine the Company’s overall allowance, which is included on the consolidated balance sheet.
Commercial:
Commercial and industrial - Commercial and industrial loans are generally underwritten to existing cash flows of operating businesses.
Additionally, economic trends influenced by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely correlated to the credit quality of
these loans. Past due payments may indicate the borrower’s capacity to repay their obligations may be deteriorating.
Agricultural production - Loans secured by crop production and livestock are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely
outside the control of Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions.
Real Estate:
Owner-occupied commercial real estate - Real estate collateral secured by commercial or professional properties with repayment arising
from the owner’s business cash flows. To meet this classification, the owner’s operation must occupy no less than 50% of the real estate held.
Financial profitability and capacity to meet the cyclical nature of the industry and related real estate market over a significant timeframe is
essential.

Table of Contents
Real estate construction and other land loans - Land and construction loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other
real estate portfolio segments. A major risk arises from the necessity to complete projects within specified costs and time lines. Trends in the
construction industry significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as demand drives construction activity. In addition, trends in real estate
values significantly impact the credit quality of these loans, as property values determine the economic viability of construction projects.
Agricultural real estate - Agricultural loans secured by real estate generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss caused by changes in
concentration of permanent plantings, government subsidies, and the value of the U.S. dollar affecting the export of commodities.
Investor commercial real estate - Investor commercial real estate loans generally possess a higher inherent risk of loss than other real
estate portfolio segments, except land and construction loans. Adverse economic developments or an overbuilt market impact commercial real
estate projects and may result in troubled loans. Trends in vacancy rates of commercial properties impact the credit quality of these loans. High
vacancy rates reduce operating revenues and the ability for properties to produce sufficient cash flows to service debt obligations.
Other real estate - Primarily loans secured by agricultural real estate for development and production of permanent plantings that have
not reached maximum yields. Also real estate loans where agricultural vertical integration exists in packing and shipping of commodities. Risk is
primarily based on the liquidity of the borrower to sustain payment during the development period.
Consumer:
Equity loans and lines of credit - The degree of risk in residential real estate lending depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to
collateral value, the interest rate and the borrower’s ability to repay in an orderly fashion. These loans generally possess a lower inherent risk of
loss than other real estate portfolio segments. Economic trends determined by unemployment rates and other key economic indicators are closely
correlated to the credit quality of these loans. Weak economic trends may indicate that the borrowers’ capacity to repay their obligations may be
deteriorating.
Installment and other consumer loans - An installment loan portfolio is usually comprised of a large number of small loans scheduled to
be amortized over a specific period. Most installment loans are made directly for consumer purchases. Other consumer loans include other open
ended unsecured consumer loans. Open ended unsecured loans generally have a higher rate of default than all other portfolio segments and are
also impacted by weak economic conditions and trends. Open ended unsecured loans in homogeneous loan portfolio segments are not evaluated
for specific impairment.
Although management believes the allowance to be adequate, ultimate losses may vary from its estimates. At least quarterly, the Board of
Directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance, including consideration of the relative risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and
other factors. If the Board of Directors and management determine that changes are warranted based on those reviews, the allowance is adjusted.
In addition, the Company’s primary regulators, the FDIC and California Department of Business Oversight, as an integral part of their examination
process, review the adequacy of the allowance. These regulatory agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about
information available at the time of their examinations.
Risk Rating - The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans, and periodically performs detailed reviews of all such loans over a certain threshold to
identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. The most recent review of risk rating was completed in December 2019.
These risk ratings are also subject to examination by independent specialists engaged by the Company, and the Company’s regulators. During
these internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which
borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing these loans. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each
individual loan. The risk ratings can be grouped into five major categories, defined as follows:
Pass - A pass loan is a strong credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management’s close attention.
Special Mention - A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these
potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or in the Company’s credit position at some future date.
Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
Substandard - A substandard loan is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the value
of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the
debt. Well-defined weaknesses include a project’s lack of marketability, inadequate cash flow or collateral support, failure to complete construction
on time, or the project’s failure to fulfill economic expectations. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain
some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful - Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that
the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and
improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and
70

Table of Contents
reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is
deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital
injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. Doubtful classification is considered temporary and short term.
Loss - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charged off immediately.
The general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses also consists of reserve factors that are based on management’s
assessment of the following for each portfolio segment: (1) inherent credit risk, (2) historical losses and (3) other qualitative factors including
economic trends in the Company’s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, the
Company’s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent in the portfolio taken as a whole. Inherent credit
risk and qualitative reserve factors are inherently subjective and are driven by the repayment risk associated with each class of loans.
Bank Premises and Equipment - Land is carried at cost. Bank premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The useful lives of Bank premises
are estimated to be between twenty and forty years. The useful lives of improvements to Bank premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are
estimated to be three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the asset or the term of the related lease, whichever is
shorter. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any
resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred.
The Bank evaluates premises and equipment for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Stock - The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based
on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security,
and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
Investments in Low Income Housing Tax Credit Funds - The Bank has invested in limited partnerships that were formed to develop and operate
affordable housing projects for low or moderate income tenants throughout California. Our ownership in each limited partnership is less than two
percent. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-01, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), we elected to account for the
investments in qualified affordable housing tax credit funds using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization
method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received and the net investment
performance is recognized as part of income tax expense (benefit). Each of the partnerships must meet the regulatory minimum requirements for
affordable housing for a minimum 15-year compliance period to fully utilize the tax credits. If the partnerships cease to qualify during the
compliance period, the credit may be denied for any period in which the project is not in compliance and a portion of the credit previously taken is
subject to recapture with interest. The Company’s investment in Low Income Housing Tax Credit Funds is reported in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet.
Other Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned (OREO) is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of
deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Losses recognized at the time of acquiring property in full or partial satisfaction of debt are charged against the
allowance for credit losses. OREO, when acquired, is initially recorded at fair value less estimated disposition costs, establishing a new cost basis.
Fair value of OREO is generally based on an independent appraisal of the property. Subsequent to initial measurement, OREO is carried at the
lower of the recorded investment or fair value less disposition costs. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is
recorded through noninterest expense. Revenues and expenses associated with OREO are reported as a component of noninterest expense when
incurred.
Foreclosed Assets - Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired,
establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through operations. Operating
costs after acquisition are expensed. Gains and losses on disposition are included in noninterest expense. The carrying value of foreclosed assets
was $0 at December 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018.
Bank Owned Life Insurance - The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives. Company owned life insurance is
recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for
other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
Business Combinations - The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition
method, assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Management utilizes various valuation
techniques included discounted cash flow analyses to determine these fair values. Any
71

Table of Contents
excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is
recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill - Business combinations involving the Bank’s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise give rise to goodwill.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the net fair value of assets, including identified intangible assets,
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The value of goodwill is ultimately
derived from the Bank’s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisitions. A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair
value of goodwill and result in impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment.
The Company has selected September 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Management assessed qualitative factors
including performance trends and noted no factors indicating goodwill impairment. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if
an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount. No such
events or circumstances arose during the fourth quarter of 2019, so goodwill was not required to be retested. Goodwill is the only intangible asset
with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.
Intangible Assets - The intangible assets at December 31, 2019 represent the estimated fair value of the core deposit relationships acquired in
business combinations. Core deposit intangibles are being amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of five to ten years from
the date of acquisition. Management evaluates the remaining useful lives quarterly to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a
revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Based on the evaluation, no changes to the remaining useful lives was required. Management
performed an annual impairment test on core deposit intangibles as of September 30, 2019 and determined no impairment was necessary. Core
deposit intangibles are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances arose during the fourth quarter of 2019, so core deposit
intangibles were not required to be retested.
Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments - Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments
to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount of these items represents the exposure
to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
Income Taxes - The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with the Bank. The allocation of income tax expense represents each
entity’s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes.
Income tax expense represents the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date
of enactment. On the balance sheet, net deferred tax assets are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets.
The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is “more likely than not” that all or a
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. “More likely than not” is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both
positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - The Company uses a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in
the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is
the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely
than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.
Interest expense and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as income tax expense in the consolidated
statement of income.
Retirement Plans - Employee 401(k) plan expense is the amount of employer matching contributions. Profit sharing plan expense is the amount of
employer contributions. Contributions to the profit sharing plan are determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Deferred compensation
and supplemental retirement plan expense is allocated over years of service.
Earnings Per Common Share - Basic earnings per common share (EPS), which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders (net income after deducting dividends, if any, on preferred stock and accretion of discount) by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock, such as stock options or warrants, result in the issuance of common stock which shares in the earnings of the Company. All data
with respect to computing earnings per share
72

Table of Contents
is retroactively adjusted to reflect stock dividends and splits and the treasury stock method is applied to determine the dilutive effect of stock
options in computing diluted EPS.
Comprehensive Income - Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
Loss Contingencies - Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities
when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are such
matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.
Restrictions on Cash - Cash on hand or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank was required to meet regulatory reserve and clearing
requirements.
Share-Based Compensation - Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees, based on the fair
value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes-Merton model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market
price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Additionally, the compensation expense for the
Company’s employee stock ownership plan is based on the market price of the shares as they are committed to be released to participant accounts.
Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting,
compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
Dividend Restriction - Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Company
or by the Company to shareholders.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions,
as more fully disclosed in Note 3. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit
risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market
conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards:
FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 - Leases - Overall (Subtopic 845), was issued February 2016. ASU 2016-02 will, among other
things, require lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the
lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made
to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU
2016-02 was effective for us on January 1, 2019 and initially required transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or
entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-
11, “Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements,” which, among other things, provides an additional transition method that would allow entities to
not apply the guidance in ASU 2016-02 in the comparative periods presented in the financial statements and instead recognize a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. In December 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-20, “Leases
(Topic 842) - Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors,” which provides for certain policy elections and changes lessor accounting for sales and
similar taxes and certain lessor costs. As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease
liability of approximately $10 million on the balance sheet for its operating leases where it is a lessee. The Company elected to apply certain
practical expedients provided under ASU 2016-02 whereby the Company will not reassess(i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or
contain leases, (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company also did
not apply the recognition requirements of ASU 2016-02 to any short-term leases (as defined by related accounting guidance). The Company
accounts for lease and non-lease components separately because such amounts are readily determinable under the Company’s lease contracts and
because the Company expects this election will result in a lower impact on our balance sheet.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Subtopic 326): Financial Instruments
- Credit Losses, commonly referred to as “CECL,” was issued June 2016. The provisions of the update eliminate the probable initial recognition
threshold under current GAAP which requires reserves to be based on an incurred loss methodology. Under CECL, reserves required for financial
assets measured at amortized cost will reflect an organization’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial
asset and thereby require the use of reasonable
73

Table of Contents
and supportable forecasts to estimate future credit losses. Because CECL encompasses all financial assets carried at amortized cost, the
requirement that reserves be established based on an organization’s reasonable and supportable estimate of expected credit losses extends to held
to maturity (“HTM”) debt securities. Under the provisions of the update, credit losses recognized on available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities will
be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down. In addition, CECL will modify the accounting for purchased loans, with credit
deterioration since origination, so that reserves are established at the date of acquisition for purchased loans. Under current GAAP a purchased
loan’s contractual balance is adjusted to fair value through a credit discount and no reserve is recorded on the purchased loan upon acquisition.
Since under CECL, reserves will be established for purchased loans at the time of acquisition, the accounting for purchased loans is made more
comparable to the accounting for originated loans. Finally, increased disclosure requirements under CECL require organizations to present the
currently required credit quality disclosures disaggregated by the year of origination or vintage. The FASB expects that the evaluation of
underwriting standards and credit quality trends by financial statement users will be enhanced with the additional vintage disclosures. On August
15, 2019, the FASB issued a proposed Accounting Standards Update (ASU), “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and
Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates,” that would provide private entities and certain small public companies additional
time to implement the standards of CECL, leases, and hedging. On October 16, 2019, the FASB affirmed this proposal and directed the staff to draft
a final ASU. The final ASU extended the effective date for SEC filers, such as the Company, that are classified as small reporting companies to
January 1, 2023.
The Company has formed an internal task force that is responsible for oversight of the Company’s implementation strategy for compliance with
provisions of the new standard. The Company has also established a project management governance process to manage the implementation across
affected disciplines. An external provider specializing in community bank loss driver and CECL reserving model design as well as other related
consulting services has been retained, and we have begun to evaluate potential CECL modeling alternatives. As part of this process, the Company
has determined potential loan pool segmentation and sub-segmentation under CECL, as well as begun to evaluate the key economic loss drivers for
each segment. Further, the Company has begun developing internal controls around the CECL process, data, calculations and implementation. The
Company presently plans to generate and evaluate model scenarios under CECL in tandem with its current reserving processes for interim and
annual reporting periods during 2020 due to the fact the Company elected to delay implementation of the CECL process as allowed by FASB. While
the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this new guidance, management expects the impact of adoption will
be significantly influenced by the composition and quality of the Company’s loans as well as the economic conditions as of the date of adoption. The
Company also anticipates significant changes to the processes and procedures for calculating the reserve for credit losses and continues to
evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04 - Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,
was issued January 2017. The provisions of the update eliminate the existing second step of the goodwill impairment test which provides for the
allocation of reporting unit fair value among existing assets and liabilities, with the net leftover amount representing the implied fair value of
goodwill. In replacement of the existing goodwill impairment rule, the update will provide that impairment should be recognized as the excess of
any of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the provisions of this update, the amount of the impairment is
limited to the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments of the update will
become effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 during the first quarter of 2019 and it did
not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-08 - Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization
on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, was issued March 2017. The provisions of the update require premiums recognized upon the purchase of
callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest call date in order to avoid losses recognized upon call. For public business entities that are
SEC filers, the amendments of the update are effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this ASU effective
January 1, 2019 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-13 - Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure
Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, was issued August 2018. The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the
disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement
disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13
and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. Management is
currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Upon adoption, the Company expects that it will have a slight change in presentation, and an immaterial impact to its results of operations,
financial position, and liquidity.
2. ACQUISITIONS
On October 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Folsom Lake Bank (“FLB”) for an aggregate transaction value of $28,475,000. FLB
was merged into the Bank, and the Company issued 1,276,888 shares of common stock to the former shareholders of FLB. The Company also
assumed the outstanding FLB stock options. With the FLB acquisition, the Company added two full service branches, located in Folsom, and
Rancho Cordova, California. The FLB Roseville branch was consolidated with the Company’s Roseville branch in October 2017. FLB’s assets as of
October 1, 2017 totaled approximately $196,148,000.
In accordance with GAAP guidance for business combinations, the Company recorded $13,466,000 of goodwill and $1,879,000 of other
intangible assets on the acquisition date. The other intangible assets are primarily related to core deposits and are being amortized using a
straight-line method over a period of five years with no significant residual value. For tax purposes, purchase accounting adjustments including
goodwill are all non-taxable and/or non-deductible. Acquisition related costs of $0 and $217,000 are included in the income statement for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The acquisition was consistent with the Company’s strategy to build a regional presence in Central California. The acquisition offers the
Company the opportunity to increase profitability by introducing existing products and services to the acquired customer base as well as add new
customers in the expanded region. Goodwill arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the expected cost savings resulting from
the combined operations.
The following table summarizes the consideration paid for FLB and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at
the acquisition date (in thousands):
Merger consideration:
Common stock issued $ 28,475
Fair Value of Total Consideration Transferred $ 28,475
Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 26,279
Loans, net 117,815
Investments 41,280
Core deposit intangible 1,879
Premises and equipment 561
Federal Home Loan Bank stock 1,559
Deferred taxes and taxes receivable 2,186
Bank owned life insurance 3,997
Other assets 592
Total assets acquired 196,148
Deposits 171,948
Deposit premium 132
Short-term borrowings - Federal Home Loan Bank 7,000
Other liabilities 2,059
Total liabilities assumed 181,139
Total identifiable net assets 15,009
Goodwill $ 13,466
The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain loans that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition
date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows. As such, these loans were not considered impaired at
the acquisition date and were not subject to the guidance relating to purchased credit impaired loans, which have shown evidence of credit
deterioration since origination. Loans acquired that were not subject to these requirements include non-impaired loans and customer receivables
with a fair value and gross contractual amounts receivable of $117,815,000 and $121,872,000, respectively, on the date of acquisition. See Note 5
for discussion of purchased credit impaired loans.

3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair Value Hierarchy
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In accordance with applicable
guidance, the Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and
liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Valuations within these levels are based upon:
Level 1 — Quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets that the Company has the ability to
access as of the measurement date.
Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active,
and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions
reflect the Company’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use on pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include
management judgment and estimation which may be significant.
Management monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the
fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from
one fair value level to another. In such instances, we report the transfer at the beginning of the reporting period.

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering the Company’s entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument for sale at one time, nor do they attempt to estimate the value of anticipated future business related to the instruments. In
addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have
not been considered in any of these estimates.
These estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market data and information about the financial instruments.
Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the fair values presented.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values are described as follows:
(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents — The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other banks, and Federal funds
sold approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.
(b) Investment Securities — Investment securities in Level 1 are mutual funds and fair values are based on quoted market prices for identical
instruments traded in active markets. Fair values for investment securities classified in Level 2 are based on quoted
77

Table of Contents
market prices for similar securities in active markets. For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available,
fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators.
(c) Loans — Fair values of loans are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit
risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans are measured at estimated
fair value on the date of acquisition. Carrying value is calculated as the present value of expected cash flows and approximates fair value and
included in Level 3. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for
loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are initially valued at the lower of
cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. For collateral
dependent real estate loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach
or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by
the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually
significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an
appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical
knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s
business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted
accordingly. The estimated fair values of financial instruments disclosed above a follow the guidance in ASU 2016-01 which prescribes an “exit
price” approach in estimating and disclosing fair value of financial instruments incorporating discounts for credit, liquidity, and marketability
factors.
(d) FHLB Stock — It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability.
(e) Deposits — Fair value of demand deposit, savings, and money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair value for fixed and variable rate certificates of deposit are
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates offered at each reporting date by the Company for certificates with similar
remaining maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification.
(f) Short-Term Borrowings — The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term
borrowings, generally maturing within ninety days, approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification.
The fair values of the Company’s Subordinated Debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.
(g) Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable — The fair value of accrued interest receivable and payable is based on the fair value hierarchy of the
related asset or liability.
(h) Off-Balance Sheet Instruments — Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged
to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing. The fair value
of commitments is not material.

Fair values for available-for-sale investment securities in Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets. For
securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or
other market indicators.
Management evaluates the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the
transfer relative to total assets, total liabilities or total earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no transfers between levels occurred.
There were no Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019. Also there were no liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019.
Non-recurring Basis
The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As of
December 31, 2019 there were no impaired loans or assets that were measured at the lower of cost or fair value.
At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive
specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals.
These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach.
Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and
income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair
value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports,
adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation, and
management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. The fair value of impaired
loans is based on the fair value of the collateral. Impaired loans were determined to be collateral dependent and categorized as Level 3 due to
ongoing real estate market conditions resulting in inactive market data, which in turn required the use of unobservable inputs and assumptions in
fair value measurements. Impaired loans evaluated under the discounted cash flow method are excluded from the table above. The discounted cash
flow method as prescribed by ASC 310 is not a fair value measurement since the discount rate utilized is the loan’s effective interest rate which is
not a market rate. There were no changes in valuation techniques used during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Appraisals for collateral-dependent impaired loans are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified
residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once
received, the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value is compared with independent data
sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no loans measured using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans.
During the year ended December 31, 2019 specific allocation for the allowance for credit losses related to loans carried at fair value was $0,
compared to $27,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no net charge-offs related to loans carried at fair value at December
31, 2019 and 2018.

Losses recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017 were incurred in order to reposition the investment securities portfolio based on the current rate
environment. The securities which were sold at a loss were acquired when the rate environment was not as volatile. The securities which were sold
were primarily purchased several years ago to serve a purpose in the rate environment in which the securities were purchased. The Company
addressed risks in the security portfolio by selling these securities and using the proceeds to purchase securities that fit with the Company’s
current risk profile.
The provision for income taxes includes $1,537,000, $388,000, and $1,178,000 income tax impact from the reclassification of unrealized net

We periodically evaluate each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment, relying primarily on industry analyst reports,
observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations. The portion of the impairment that is attributable to a shortage in the present value
of expected future cash flows relative to the amortized cost should be recorded as a current period charge to earnings. The discount rate in this
analysis is the original yield expected at time of purchase.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company performed an analysis of the investment portfolio to determine whether any of the investments held
in the portfolio had an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Management evaluated all investment securities with an unrealized loss at
December 31, 2019, and identified those that had an unrealized loss for at least a consecutive 12 month period, which had an unrealized loss at
December 31, 2019 greater than 10% of the recorded book value on that date, or which had an unrealized loss of more than $10,000. Management
also analyzed any securities that may have been downgraded by credit rating agencies.
For those bonds that met the evaluation criteria, management obtained and reviewed the most recently published national credit ratings for
those bonds. For those bonds that were obligations of states and political subdivisions with an investment grade rating by the rating agencies,
management also evaluated the financial condition of the municipality and any applicable municipal bond insurance provider and concluded that no
credit related impairment existed. There were no OTTI losses recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.
U.S. Government Agencies - At December 31, 2019, the Company held six U.S. Government agency securities of which none were in a loss position
for less than 12 months and five were in a loss position and had been in a loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses on the
Company’s investments in U.S. Government Agencies were caused by interest rate changes. The contractual terms of those investments do not
permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized costs of the investment. Because the decline in market value is
attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that
it will not be required to sell those
82

Table of Contents
investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired at December 31, 2019.
Obligations of States and Political Subdivisions - At December 31, 2019, the Company held 41 obligations of states and political subdivision
securities of which 15 were in a loss position.
U.S. Government Sponsored Entities and Agencies Collateralized by Residential Mortgage Obligations - At December 31, 2019, the Company held
119 U.S. Government sponsored entity and agency securities collateralized by residential mortgage obligation securities of which 22 were in a loss
position for less than 12 months and 18 have been in a loss position for more than 12 months. The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments
in U.S. Government sponsored entity and agencies collateralized by residential mortgage obligations were caused by interest rate changes. The
contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed or supported by an agency or sponsored entity of the U.S. Government. Accordingly, it
is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company’s investment. Because the decline in
market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell, and it is more
likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not
consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2019.
Private Label Mortgage and Asset Backed Securities - At December 31, 2019, the Company had a total of 41 PLMBS with a remaining principal
balance of $155,308,000 and a gross and net unrealized loss of approximately $4,070,000. Four of these securities were in a loss position for less
than 12 months and one has been in a loss position for more than 12 months at December 31, 2019. Seven of these PLMBS with a remaining
principal balance of $1,593,000 had credit ratings below investment grade. The Company continues to monitor these securities for changes in
credit ratings or other indications of credit deterioration. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not
credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell those investments
until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
December 31, 2019.
Corporate Debt Securities
At December 31, 2019, the Company held two corporate debt securities of which one was in a loss position.
The following table provides a rollforward for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 of investment securities credit losses recorded

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses (the “allowance”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses in the Company’s loan
portfolio. The allowance is established through a provision for credit losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance are expected to
maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth. Credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged
against the allowance. Cash received on previously charged-off credits is recorded as a recovery to the allowance. The overall allowance consists of
two primary components, specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for probable incurred losses related to loans that are not
impaired.
For all portfolio segments, the determination of the general reserve for loans that are not impaired is based on estimates made by
management, including but not limited to, consideration of historical losses by portfolio segment (and in certain cases peer loss data) over the most
recent 20 quarters, and qualitative factors including economic trends in the Company’s service areas, industry experience and trends, geographic
concentrations, estimated collateral values, the Company’s underwriting policies, the character of the loan portfolio, and probable losses inherent
in the portfolio taken as a whole.

Impairment — — —
Balance, end of year $ 53,777 $ 53,777 $ 53,777
Business combinations involving the Company’s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise give rise to goodwill.
Total goodwill at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $53,777,000. Total goodwill at December 31, 2019 consisted of $13,466,000, $10,394,000,
$6,340,000, $14,643,000, and $8,934,000 representing the excess of the cost of Folsom Lake Bank, Sierra Vista Bank, Visalia Community Bank,
Service 1st Bancorp, and Bank of Madera County, respectively, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
the transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the Company’s ability to
generate net earnings after the acquisitions and is not deductible for tax purposes. A decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the
fair value of goodwill and result in impairment. For that reason, goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment.
The Company has selected September 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Management assessed qualitative factors
including performance trends and noted no factors indicating goodwill impairment.
Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the Company below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances arose during the fourth quarter of 2019, so
goodwill was not required to be retested.
The intangible assets at December 31, 2019 represent the estimated fair value of the core deposit relationships acquired in the acquisition
of Folsom Lake Bank in 2017 of $1,879,000, Sierra Vista Bank in 2016 of $508,000 and the 2013 acquisition of Visalia Community Bank of
$1,365,000. Core deposit intangibles are being amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated life of five to ten years from the date of
acquisition. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average remaining amortization period is three years. The carrying value of intangible assets at
December 31, 2019 was $1,878,000, net of $1,874,000 in accumulated amortization expense. The carrying value at December 31, 2018 was
$2,572,000, net of $1,180,000 in accumulated amortization expense. Management evaluates the remaining useful lives quarterly to determine
whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. Based on the evaluation, no changes to the
remaining useful lives was required. Management performed an annual impairment test on core deposit intangibles as of September 30, 2019 and
determined no impairment was necessary. Amortization expense recognized was $695,000 for 2019, $455,000 for 2018, and $234,000 for 2017.

Table of Contents
Approximately $446,494,000 in loans were pledged under a blanket lien as collateral to the FHLB for the Bank’s remaining borrowing
capacity of $304,987,000 as of December 31, 2019. FHLB advances are also secured by investment securities with amortized costs totaling
$248,000 and $326,000 and market values totaling $256,000 and $337,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Bank’s credit limit
varies according to the amount and composition of the investment and loan portfolios pledged as collateral.
Lines of Credit - The Bank had unsecured lines of credit with its correspondent banks which, in the aggregate, amounted to $70,000,000 and
$40,000,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, at interest rates which vary with market conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
the Company had no Federal funds purchased.
Federal Reserve Line of Credit - The Bank has a line of credit in the amount of $4,931,000 and $4,364,000 with the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco (FRB) at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which bears interest at the prevailing discount rate collateralized by investment
securities with amortized costs totaling $5,065,000 and $4,498,000 and market values totaling $5,036,000 and $4,475,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings with the FRB.
Note 10. Leases
Leases - The Bank leases certain of its branch facilities and administrative offices under noncancelable operating leases with terms extending
through 2028. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Operating lease cost is comprised of
lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis, the amortization of the right-of-use asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease
liability. Operating lease cost is included in occupancy and equipment expense on our consolidated statements of income. We evaluate the lease
term by assuming the exercise of options to extend that are reasonably assured and those option periods covered by an option to terminate the
lease, if deemed not reasonably certain to be exercised. The lease term is used to determine the straight-line expense and limits the depreciable life
of any related leasehold improvements. Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses
associated with the leased premises. These expenses are classified in occupancy and equipment expense on our consolidated statements of income,
consistent with similar costs for owned locations, but is not included in operating lease cost below. We calculate the lease liability using a discount
rate that represents our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date.
Future minimum lease payments on noncancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

11. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES
Service 1st Capital Trust I is a Delaware business trust formed by Service 1st. The Company succeeded to all of the rights and obligations of Service
1st in connection with the merger with Service 1st as of November 12, 2008. The Trust was formed on August 17, 2006 for the sole purpose of
issuing trust preferred securities fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Service 1st. Under applicable regulatory guidance, the amount of trust
preferred securities that is eligible as Tier 1 capital is limited to 25% of the Company’s Tier 1 capital on a pro forma basis. At December 31, 2019,
all of the trust preferred securities that have been issued qualify as Tier 1 capital. The trust preferred securities mature on October 7, 2036, are
redeemable at the Company’s option, and require quarterly distributions by the Trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities at a variable
interest rate which will adjust quarterly to equal the three month LIBOR plus 1.60%.
The Trust used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities to purchase approximately $5,155,000 in aggregate principal
amount of Service 1st’s junior subordinated notes (the Notes). The Notes bear interest at the same variable interest rate during the same quarterly
periods as the trust preferred securities. The Notes are redeemable by the Company on any January 7, April 7, July 7, or October 7 or at any time
within 90 days following the occurrence of certain events, such as: (i) a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes (ii) in the event the
Trust is deemed an investment company or (iii) upon the occurrence of certain adverse tax events. In each such case, the Company may redeem
the Notes for their aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest.
The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable at the election of the trustee or holders of 25% of the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Notes in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of any interest following the nonpayment of any such interest for 20 or
more consecutive quarterly periods.
95

Table of Contents
Holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled to a cumulative cash distribution on the liquidation amount of $1,000 per security. For
each January 7, April 7, July 7 or October 7 of each year, the rate will be adjusted to equal the three month LIBOR plus 1.60%. As of December 31,
2019, the rate was 3.59%. Interest expense recognized by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $210,000,
$199,000 and $147,000, respectively.
12. INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands):

The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on
projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The
realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50% chance. All available evidence, both positive and
negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Thus, Management concludes
no valuation allowance is necessary against deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rates to operating income
before income taxes. The significant items comprising these differences for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 consisted of the
following:
2019 2018 2017
Federal income tax, at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 %
State taxes, net of Federal tax benefit 8.3 % 7.8 % 4.8 %
Tax exempt investment security income, net (0.9)% (2.7)% (10.1)%
Bank owned life insurance, net (0.4)% (0.6)% (0.8)%
Compensation - Stock Compensation (0.2)% (0.6)% (2.8)%
Re-measurement resulting from Tax Act — % — % 14.8 %
Change in uncertain tax positions — % (0.3)% (0.9)%
Other 0.6 % (0.9)% 1.1 %
Effective tax rate 28.4 % 23.7 % 41.1 %
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had Federal and California net operating loss (“NOL”) carry-forwards of $7,571,000 and $7,893,000,
respectively. These NOLs were acquired through business combinations and are subject to IRC
97

Table of Contents
382 will begin expiring at various dates between 2029 and 2035, for federal and California purposes. While they are subject to IRC Section 382,
management has determined that all of the NOLs are more than likely than not to be utilized before they expire.
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “ Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017, the federal tax rate applied to the
Company’s net deferred tax assets were re-measured to reflect the 2018 tax rates (the rates at which the deferred tax items are expected to
reverse). The change to the tax rates (including the rate change applied to deferred taxes reflected in other comprehensive income and certain tax-
advantaged investments as reflected in other assets) resulted in an increase to the Company’s 2017 tax provision of $3,535,000.
The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, California, and Utah jurisdictions. The Company conducts all of
its business activities in the State of California. There are no pending U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by those taxing authorities.
The Company is no longer subject to the examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for the years ended before December 31, 2016 and by the
state taxing authorities for the years ended before December 31, 2015.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits and does not expect any material changes in the next 12 months.
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Federal Reserve Requirements - Banks are required to maintain reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank equal to a percentage of their reservable
deposits. The amount of such reserve balances required at December 31, 2019 was $17,392,000.
Correspondent Banking Agreements - The Bank maintains funds on deposit with other federally insured financial institutions under correspondent
banking agreements. Uninsured deposits totaled $327,000 at December 31, 2019.
Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk - The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of
business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial
instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet.
The Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for commitments to extend credit and standby letters
of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and
standby letters of credit as it does for loans included on the balance sheet.
The following financial instruments represent off-balance-sheet credit risk (in thousands):
December 31,
2019 2018
Commitments to extend credit $ 289,465 $ 309,824
Standby letters of credit $ 1,717 $ 2,450
Commitments to extend credit consist primarily of unfunded commercial loan commitments and revolving lines of credit, single-family
residential equity lines of credit and commercial and residential real estate construction loans. Construction loans are established under standard
underwriting guidelines and policies and are secured by deeds of trust, with disbursements made over the course of construction. Commercial
revolving lines of credit have a high degree of industry diversification. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are generally secured and are issued by the
Bank to guarantee the financial obligation or performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The fair value of the liability related to these standby letters of
credit, which represents the fees received for issuing the guarantees, was not significant at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company
recognizes these fees as revenue over the term of the commitment or when the commitment is used.
At December 31, 2019, commercial loan commitments represent 53% of total commitments and are generally secured by collateral other
than real estate or unsecured. Real estate loan commitments represent 39% of total commitments and are generally secured by property with a
loan-to-value ratio not to exceed 80%. Consumer loan commitments represent the
98

Table of Contents
remaining 8% of total commitments and are generally unsecured. In addition, the majority of the Bank’s loan commitments have variable interest
rates.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of a contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations was
$250,000 and $225,000, respectively. The contingent allocation for probable loan loss experience on unfunded obligations is calculated by
management using an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process. While related to credit losses, this allocation is not a part of the
ALLL and is considered separately as a liability for accounting and regulatory reporting purposes. Changes in this contingent allocation are
recorded in other non-interest expense.
Concentrations of Credit Risk - At December 31, 2019, in management’s judgment, a concentration of loans existed in commercial loans and real-
estate-related loans, representing approximately 95.5% of total loans of which 13.5% were commercial and 82.0% were real-estate-related.
At December 31, 2018, in management’s judgment, a concentration of loans existed in commercial loans and real-estate-related loans,
representing approximately 95.8% of total loans of which 12% were commercial and 83.8% were real-estate-related.
Management believes the loans within these concentrations have no more than the typical risks of collectability. However, in light of the
current economic environment, additional declines in the performance of the economy in general, or a continued decline in real estate values or
drought-related decline in agricultural business in the Company’s primary market area could have an adverse impact on collectability, increase the
level of real-estate-related nonperforming loans, or have other adverse effects which alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.
Contingencies - The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or
consolidated results of operations of the Company.
14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Regulatory Capital - The Company and the Bank are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements administered by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements could result in mandatory or, discretionary actions
by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company and the Bank each meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their respective assets, liabilities and
certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
The Bank is also subject to additional capital guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as
well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.
The most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under these guidelines. Management knows of no conditions
or events since that notification that would change the Bank’s category.
Capital ratios are reviewed by Management on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is
adequate to meet our anticipated future needs. For all periods presented, the Bank’s ratios exceed the regulatory definition of well capitalized
under the regulatory framework for prompt correct action and the Company’s ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy
purposes.
Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more ($3 Billion or more effective August 30,
2018) and banks like Central Valley Community Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January
1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a
Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged
from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4%.
In addition, a “capital conversation buffer” is established which, when fully phased-in, will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of
common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The
2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a
total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement was phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. The capital conservation
buffer as of December 31, 2019 was 2.5% and 1.875% as of December 31, 2018. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the
capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus
payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.

acquisition, and cash dividends approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company declared and paid a total of $3,010,000 or $0.24 per
common share cash dividend to shareholders of record during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Table of Contents
The Company’s primary source of income with which to pay cash dividends is dividends from the Bank. The California Financial Code
restricts the total amount of dividends payable by a bank at any time without obtaining the prior approval of the California Department of Business
Oversight to the lesser of (1) the Bank’s retained earnings or (2) the Bank’s net income for its last three fiscal years, less distributions made to
shareholders during the same three-year period. At December 31, 2019, $32,116,000 of the Bank’s retained earnings were free of these
restrictions.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations is as follows (in

15. SHARED-BASED COMPENSATION
On December 31, 2019, the Company had five share-based compensation plans, which are described below. The Plans do not provide for the
settlement of awards in cash and new shares are issued upon option exercise or restricted share grants.
The Central Valley Community Bancorp 2000 Stock Option Plan (2000 Plan) expired on November 15, 2010. The Central Valley Community
Bancorp 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) was adopted in May 2005 and expired March 16, 2015. While outstanding arrangements to issue
shares under these plans, including options, continue in force until their expiration, no new options will be granted under these plans. The plans
require that the exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the option price
must be paid in full at the time it is exercised. The options and awards under the plans expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but
not later than ten years from the date of grant. The vesting period for the options, restricted common stock awards and option related stock
appreciation rights is determined by the Board of Directors and is generally over five years.
In May 2015, the Company adopted the Central Valley Community Bancorp 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2015 Plan). The plan provides for
awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock. The plan also allows for
performance awards that may be in the form of cash or shares of the Company, including restricted stock. The 2015 plan requires that the exercise
price may not be less than the fair market value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the option price must be paid in full at the
time it is exercised. The options and awards under the plan expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from
the date of grant. The vesting period for the options, restricted common stock awards and option related stock appreciation rights is determined by
the Board of Directors and is over one to five years. The maximum number of shares that can be issued with respect to all awards under the plan is
875,000. Currently under the 2015 Plan, 788,166 shares remain reserved for future grants as of December 31, 2019.
Effective June 2, 2017, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby our employees may purchase Company common
shares through payroll deductions of between one percent and 15 percent of pay in each pay period. Shares are purchased at the end of an offering
period at a discount of 10 percent from the lower of the closing market price on the Offering Date (first trading day of each offering period) or the
Investment Date (last trading day of each offering period). The plan calls for 500,000 common shares to be set aside for employee purchases, and
there were 473,692 shares available for future purchase under the plan as of December 31, 2019.
In October 2017, the Company adopted the Folsom Lake Bank 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan). The plan provides for awards in the
form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock. While outstanding arrangements to
issue shares under this plan, including options, continue in force until their expiration, no new options will be granted under this plan. The options
and awards under the plan expire on dates determined by the Board of Directors, but not later than ten years from the date of grant. The vesting
period for the options, restricted

common stock awards and option related stock appreciation rights is determined by the Board of Directors and is generally over five years. The
maximum number of shares that can be issued with respect to all awards under the plan is 38,400.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the compensation cost recognized for share-based compensation was $555,000,
$482,000, and $384,000, respectively. The recognized tax benefit for share-based compensation expense was $46,000, $142,000, and $805,000 for
2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.
Stock Options - The Company bases the fair value of the options granted on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model
that uses assumptions based on expected option life and the level of estimated forfeitures, expected stock volatility, risk free interest rate, and
dividend yield. The expected term and level of estimated forfeitures of the Company’s options are based on the Company’s own historical
experience. Stock volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield curve
for the periods within the contractual life of the options in effect at the time of grant. The compensation cost for options granted is based on the
weighted average grant date fair value per share.
No options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock were granted during the years ending December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017
from any of the Company’s stock based compensation plans.

As of December 31, 2019, there is no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under all Plans. All options are fully
vested.
Restricted Common Stock Awards - The 2005 Plan and 2015 Plan provide for the issuance of shares to directors and officers. Restricted common
stock grants typically vest over a one to five-year period. Restricted common stock (all of which are shares of our common stock) is subject to
forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. The cost of these awards is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair
value of our common stock on the date of the grant.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 25,420, and 22,204 shares of restricted common stock were granted from
outstanding grants under the 2005 and 2015 Plans. The restricted common stock had a weighted average fair value of 19.77 and 20.76 per share on
the date of grant during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The shares awarded to employees and directors under the
restricted stock agreements vest on applicable vesting dates only to the extent the recipient of the shares is then an employee or a director of the
Company or one of its subsidiaries, and each recipient will forfeit all of the shares that have not vested on the date his or her employment or service
is terminated.
As of December 31, 2019, there were 45,160 shares of restricted stock that are nonvested and expected to vest. Share-based compensation
cost charged against income for restricted stock awards was $533,000, $459,000, and $349,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and
2017 respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, there was $490,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted common stock.
Restricted stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted average remaining period of 1.57 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures. Restricted common stock
awards had an intrinsic value of $815,000 at December 31, 2019.
16. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan - The Bank has established a 401(k) and profit sharing plan. The 401(k) plan covers substantially all employees who
have completed a one-month employment period. Participants in the profit sharing plan are eligible to receive employer contributions after
completion of 2 years of service. Bank contributions to the profit sharing plan are determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Participants are automatically vested 100% in all employer contributions. The Bank contributed $750,000, $900,000, and $600,000 to the profit
sharing plan in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Additionally, the Bank may elect to make a matching contribution to the participants’ 401(k) plan accounts. The amount to be contributed is
announced by the Bank at the beginning of the plan year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Bank made a 100% matching contribution on
all deferred amounts up to 5% of eligible compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank made a 100% matching
contribution on all deferred amounts up to 3% of eligible compensation and a 50% matching contribution on all deferred amounts above 3% to a
maximum of 5%. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Bank made matching contributions totaling $959,000, $748,000,
and $686,000, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plans - The Bank has a nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan which provides directors with an unfunded, deferred
compensation program. Under the plan, eligible participants may elect to defer some or all of their current compensation or director fees.
Deferred amounts earn interest at an annual rate determined by the Board of Directors (3.12% at December 31, 2019). At December 31, 2019 and
2018, the total net deferrals included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities were $4,177,000 and $3,842,000, respectively.
In connection with the implementation of the above plan, single premium universal life insurance policies on the life of each participant
were purchased by the Bank, which is the beneficiary and owner of the policies. The cash surrender value
103

Table of Contents
of the policies totaled $9,686,000 and $9,436,000 and at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income recognized on these policies, net of
related expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, was $250,000, $249,000, and $255,000, respectively.
In October 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Bank adopted a board resolution to create the Central Valley Community
Bank Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the Executive Plan). Pursuant to the Executive Plan, all eligible executives of the Bank may elect to
defer up to 50 percent of their compensation for each deferral year. Deferred amounts earn interest at an annual rate determined by the Board of
Directors (3.12% at December 31, 2019). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total net deferrals included in accrued interest payable and other
liabilities were $145,000 and $129,000, respectively.
Salary Continuation Plans - The Board of Directors has approved salary continuation plans for certain key executives. Under these plans, the Bank
is obligated to provide the executives with annual benefits for 10-15 years after retirement. In connection with the acquisitions of Folsom Lake
Bank (FLB), Service 1st Bank, and Visalia Community Bank (VCB), the Bank assumed a liability for the estimated present value of future benefits
payable to former key executives of FLB, Service 1st, and VCB. The liability relates to change in control benefits associated with their salary
continuation plans. The benefits are payable to the individuals when they reach retirement age. These benefits are substantially equivalent to those
available under split-dollar life insurance policies purchased by the Bank on the life of the executives. The expense recognized under these plans
for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, totaled $1,465,000, $15,000, and $561,000, respectively. Accrued compensation payable
under the salary continuation plans totaled $10,716,000 and $9,816,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These benefits are
substantially equivalent to those available under split-dollar life insurance policies acquired.
In connection with these plans, the Bank purchased single-premium life insurance policies with cash surrender values totaling $20,544,000
and $19,066,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income recognized on these policies, net of related expense, for the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 totaled $478,000, $446,000, and $366,000, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan - During 2017, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows employees to purchase the
Company’s stock at a discount to fair market value as of the date of purchase. The Company bears all costs of administering the plan, including
broker’s fees, commissions, postage and other costs actually incurred.

ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
Not Applicable.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the
design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a- l 5(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies
and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2019. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
(d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can
occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.
