PART I
Item 1. Business.
Overview
We produce digital video imaging and storage products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. Our current
products are an in-car digital video/audio recorder contained in a rear-view mirror for use in law enforcement and commercial fleets; a system that
provides its law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from multiple vantage points and hands-free automatic activation of body-
worn cameras and in-car video systems; a miniature digital video system designed to be worn on an individual’s body; and cloud storage solutions.
We have active research and development programs to adapt our technologies to other applications. We can integrate electronic, radio, computer,
mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to address needs in a variety of other industries and markets, including mass
transit, school bus, taxicab and the military. We sell our products to law enforcement agencies, private security customers and organizations and
consumer and commercial fleet operators through direct sales domestically and third-party distributors internationally.
Corporate History
We were incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into
a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the “Acquired Company”),
we had not conducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc.
The Acquired Company, which was incorporated on May 16, 2003, engaged in the design, development, marketing and sale of bow hunting-
related products. Its principal product was a digital video recording system for use in the bow hunting industry. We changed its business plan in
2004 to adapt its digital video recording system for use in the law enforcement and security markets. We began shipments of our in-car digital
video rear view mirror in March 2006.

On January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “DGLY.” We conduct our business from 9705
Loiret Boulevard, Lenexa, Kansas 66219. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774.
COVID – 19 Pandemic
The consolidated financial statements contained in this Report as well as the description of our business contained herein, unless otherwise
indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2019. Since that date, economies
throughout the world have been severely disrupted by the effects of the quarantines, business closures and the reluctance of individuals to leave
their homes as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Although we remain open as an “essential business,” our supply chain has
been disrupted and our customers and in particular our commercial customers have been significantly impacted which has, in turn, reduced our
level of operations and activities. In addition, the capital markets have been disrupted and our efforts to raise necessary capital will likely be
adversely impacted by the outbreak of the virus and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the disruptions caused by it will cease to impact
our business and the results of our operations. In reading this report on Form 10-K, including our discussion of our ability to continue as a going
concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19.
Our Products
We supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities for the law enforcement and
security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical,
and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, in-car
digital video mirror systems for law enforcement; the FirstVU and the FirstVU HD, body-worn cameras; our patented and revolutionary VuLink
product, which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement
and commercial markets; the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus, a commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the
commercial fleet and mass transit markets; and FleetVU and VuLink, our cloud-based evidence management systems. We introduced the EVO-HD
product in the second quarter of 2019 and began full-scale deliveries in the third quarter 2019. The EVO-HD is designed and built on a new and
highly advanced technology platform that will become the platform for a new family of in-car video solution products for the law enforcement and
commercial markets. We believe that the launch of these new products will help to reinvigorate our in-car and body-worn systems revenues while
diversifying and broadening the market for our product offerings. The following describes our product portfolio.
In-Car Digital Video Mirror System for law enforcement – EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite
In-car video systems for patrol cars are now a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based
systems with cameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat
of the vehicle. Most if not all manufacturers have already developed and transitioned completely to digital video, and some have offered full high
definition (“HD”) level recordings which is currently state-of-art for the industry.
Our digital video rear-view mirror unit is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that is integrated into a
rear-view mirror, with a monitor, global positioning system (“GPS”) and 900 megahertz (“MHz”) audio transceiver. Our system is more compact
and unobtrusive than certain of our competitors because it requires no recording equipment to be located in other parts of the vehicle.
Our in-car digital video rear-view mirror has the following features:
● wide angle zoom color camera;
4

● standards-based video and audio compression and recording;
● system is concealed in the rear-view mirror, replacing factory rear-view mirror;
● monitor in rear-view mirror is invisible when not activated;
● easily installs in any vehicle;
● ability to integrate with body-worn cameras including auto-activation of either system;
● archives audio/video data to the cloud, computers (wirelessly) and to compact flash memory, or file servers;
● 900 MHz audio transceiver with automatic activation;
● marks exact location of incident with integrated GPS;
● playback using Windows Media Player;
● optional wireless download of stored video evidence;
● proprietary software protects the chain of custody; and
● records to rugged and durable solid-state memory.
The Company has completed development of a new in-car digital video platform under the name EVO-HD which it launched during the
second quarter of 2019. The EVO-HD is a next generation system that offers a multiple HD in-car camera solution system with built-in patented
VuLink auto-activation technology. The EVO-HD is built on an entirely new and highly advanced technology platform that enables many new and
revolutionary features, including auto activation beyond the car and body camera. No other provider can offer built-in patented VuLink auto-
activation technology. The EVO-HD provides law enforcement officers with an easier to use, faster and more advanced system for capturing video
evidence and uploading than the Company’s competitors. Additional features include:
● a remote cloud trigger feature that allows dispatchers to remotely start recordings;
● simultaneous audio/video play back;
● cloud connectivity via cell modem, including the planned deployment of the new 5G network;
● near real-time mapping and system health monitoring;
● body-camera connectivity with built-in auto activation technology; and
● 128 gigabyte internal storage, up to 2 terabyte external solid-state drive storage.
The EVO-HD is designed and built on a new and highly advanced technology platform that will become the platform for a whole new family
of in-car video solution products for the law enforcement. The innovative EVO-HD technology replaces the current in-car mirror-based systems with
a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and
requirements of its law enforcement customers. The EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and evidence
capture assurance (“ECA”) capabilities to allow agencies to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the
VuVault.net cloud, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and real time metadata when in the field.

In-Car Digital Video “Event Recorder” System – DVM-250 Plus for Commercial Fleets
Digital Ally provides commercial fleets and commercial fleet managers with the digital video tools that they need to increase driver safety
and track assets in real-time and minimize the company’s liability risk, all while enabling fleet managers to operate the fleet at an optimal level. We
market a product designed to address these commercial fleet markets with our DVM-250 Plus event recorders that provide all types of commercial
fleets with features and capabilities which are fully-customizable, consistent with their specific application and inherent risks. The DVM-250 Plus is
a rear-view mirror based digital audio and video recording system with many, but not all of, the features of our DVM-800 law enforcement mirror
systems, which we sell at a lower price point. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture “events,” such as wrecks and erratic driving or other
abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. The commercial fleet markets may find our units attractive from both a feature and a
cost perspective compared to other providers. We believe that due to our marketing efforts, commercial fleets are adopting this technology, in
particular the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.
Digital Ally offers a suite of data management web-based tools to assist fleet managers in the organization, archival, and management of
videos and telematics information. Within the suite, there are powerful mapping and reporting tools that are intended to optimize efficiency, serve
as excellent training tools for teams on safety and ultimately generate a significant return on investment for the organization.
Management plans for the EVO-HD described above will also become the platform for a whole new family of in-car video solution products
for the commercial markets. The innovative EVO-HD technology will replace the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system
that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of its
commercial customers. In its commercial market application, the EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event
and ECA capabilities to allow customers to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the FleetVU Manager cloud-
based system for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring, powered by AWS and real time metadata when in the field.
Miniature Body-Worn Digital Video System – FirstVU HD for law enforcement and private security
This system is also a derivative of our in-car video systems, but is much smaller and lighter and more rugged and water-resistant to handle a
hostile outdoor environment. These systems can be used in many applications in addition to law enforcement and private security and are designed
specifically to be clipped to an individual’s pocket or other outer clothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage
devices. Current systems offered by competitors are digital based, but generally require a battery pack and/or storage device to be connected to
the camera by wire or other means. We believe that our FirstVU HD product is more desirable for potential users than our competitors’ offerings
because of its video quality, small size, shape and lightweight characteristics. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our
patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
Auto-activation and Interconnectivity between in-car video systems and FirstVU HD body worn camera products – VuLink for law
enforcement applications
Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that
provides intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The United States Patent and Trademark
Office (the “USPTO”) has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as
automatically activating an officer’s cameras when the light bar is activated or when a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated.
Additionally, the awarded patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this work, officers were forced
to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios, a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing
camera systems and diverted officers’ attention during critical moments. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our
patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
6

This feature is becoming a standard feature required by many law agencies. Unfortunately, certain of our competitors have chosen to
infringe our patent and develop products that provide the same or similar features as our VuLink system. We filed lawsuits against two competitors
– Axon Enterprises, Inc. (“Axon,” formerly known as Taser International, Inc.) and Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video
(“WatchGuard”) – which challenge Axon’s and WatchGuard’s infringing products. On May 13, 2019, we and WatchGuard resolved the dispute and
executed a settlement agreement in the form of a Release and License Agreement. The litigation has been dismissed as a result of this settlement.
See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
VuVault.net and FleetVU Manager
VuVault.net is a cost-effective, fully expandable, law enforcement cloud storage solution powered by AWS that provides redundant and
security-enhanced storage of all uploaded videos that comply with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Criminal Justice Information
Services Division requirements.
FleetVU Manager is our web-based software for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring that features and manages video captured by our
video event data recorders of incidents requiring attention, such as accidents. This software solution features our cloud-based web portal that
utilizes many of the features of our VuVault.net law-enforcement cloud-based storage solution.
Other Products
During the last year, we focused our research and development efforts to meet the varying needs of our customers, enhance our existing
products and commence development of new products and product categories. Our research and development efforts are intended to maintain and
enhance our competitiveness in the market niche we have carved out, as well as positioning us to compete in diverse markets outside of law
enforcement. In December 2019, the we announced a partnership with Pivot International for design and manufacture of a new and innovative
Breathalyzer Device utilizing our recently issued patent. With this new technology, when an officer is conducting a field sobriety test and the
breathalyzer is activated, the digital video recording device will automatically start a recording, later embedding the meta-data captured onto the
recorded video. The ‘732 Patent was granted by the U.S. Patent Office in August of 2019 and is an expansion of our patented VuLink automatic
activation technology.
Market and Industry Overview
Historically, our primary market has been domestic and international law enforcement agencies. In 2012, we expanded our scope by
pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. Recently, we have expanded into event security services whereby we provide the
hardware and software to supplement private security for NASCAR races, football and other sporting events, concerts and events where people
gather. In the future, given sufficient capital and market opportunity, we may further expand or focus on private security, homeland security, mass
transit, healthcare, general retail, educational, general consumer and other commercial markets. In that regard, we have several installations
involving private security on cruise ships and similar markets. Our view is there are many potential private uses of our product offerings. We have
sales in the commercial fleet and the ambulance service provider market, confirming that our DVM-250 Plus product and FleetVU Manager can
become a significant revenue producer for us.
Law Enforcement
We believe that law enforcement already recognizes a valuable use of our various digital audio/video products for the recording of roadside
sobriety tests. Without some form of video or audio recording, court proceedings usually consist of the police officer’s word against that of the
suspect. Records show that conviction rates increase substantially where there is video evidence to back up officer testimony. Video evidence also
helps to protect police departments against frivolous lawsuits.
An important largest source of police video evidence today is in-car video. Unfortunately, some police cars still do not have in-car video, and
in those that do, the camera usually points forward rather than to the side of the road where the sobriety test takes place. The in-car video is
typically of little use for domestic violence investigations, burglary or theft investigations, disorderly conduct calls or physical assaults. In virtually
all of these cases, the FirstVU HD may provide recorded evidence of the suspect’s actions and reactions to police intervention.
7

Additionally, motorcycle patrolmen rarely have video systems. Our FirstVU body camera is well suited as a mobile application of our digital
video recording system that can be used by motorcycle police and water patrol.
Crime scene investigations, including detailed photography, are typically a large part of the budgets of metropolitan police forces. The
FirstVU may record a significant portion of such evidence at a much lower cost for gathering, analyzing and storing data and evidence.
Commercial and Other Markets
There are numerous potential applications for our digital audio/video camera products. We believe that other potential markets for our
digital video systems, including the derivatives currently being developed, include private investigators, SWAT team members, over-the-road
trucking fleets, airport security, municipal fire departments, and the U.S. military. Other potential commercial markets for our digital video systems
include sporting venues and arenas.
Schools
We believe our products and offerings may be of benefit in kindergarten through twelve grade school systems. We are assessing our entry
into this potential market through several pilot tests. Preliminary results of our exploration of this market have been mixed, but we believe it may
represent a new addressable market for our mobile audio/video recording products in the future. Recent tragic events at schools have heightened
the need for providing a “safer” environment in general for schools.
Private Security Companies
There are thousands of private security agencies in the United States employing a large number of guards. Police forces use video systems
for proof of correct conduct by officers, but private security services usually have no such tool. We believe that the FirstVU HD is an excellent
management tool for these companies to monitor conduct and timing of security rounds. In addition to the FirstVU HD, the digital video security
camera can provide fill-in security when guards have large areas to cover or in areas that do not have to be monitored around the clock.
Event Security
Recently, we have expanded into event security services whereby we provide the hardware and software to supplement private security for
NASCAR races, football and other sporting events, concerts and similar events where people gather. In this regard, we have obtained new
customers including the Kansas City Chiefs, Met-Life Stadium, NASCAR and a number of other customers who have a need for event security for
specific dates rather than 100% of the time. We believe that this area will be a productive source of future revenues.
Homeland Security Market
In addition to the government, U.S. corporations are spending heavily for protection against the potential of terrorist attacks. Public and
private-sector outlays for antiterrorism measures and for protection against other forms of violence are significant. These are potential markets for
our products.
Manufacturing
We have entered into contracts with manufacturers for the assembly of the printed circuit boards used in our products. Dedicated circuit
board manufacturers are well-suited to the assembly of circuit boards with the complexity found in our products. Dedicated board manufacturers
can spread the extensive capital equipment costs of circuit board assembly among multiple projects and customers. Such manufacturers also have
the volume to enable the frequent upgrade to state-of-the-art equipment. We have identified multiple suppliers who meet our quality, cost, and
performance criteria. We also use more than one source for circuit board assembly to ensure a reliable supply over time. We use contract
manufacturers to manufacture our component subassemblies and may eventually use them to perform final assembly and testing. Due to the
complexity of our products, we believe that it is important to maintain a core of knowledgeable production personnel for consistent quality and to
limit the dissemination of sensitive intellectual property and will continue this practice. In addition, such technicians are valuable in our service and
repair business to support our growing installed customer base.
8

We also contract with two manufacturers that have manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and South Korea to produce our DVM-250
Plus, DVM-800 and DVM-800 HD products. The contracts are general in nature addressing confidentiality and other matters, have no minimum
purchase requirements and require the acceptance of specific purchase orders to support any product supply acquisitions. We are using additional
contract manufacturers based in the United States for these product lines to further mitigate any supply disruption risk and ensure competitive
pricing. We typically perform final assembly, testing and quality control functions for these products in our Lenexa, Kansas facility.
Sales and Marketing
We have an employee-based, direct sales force for domestic selling efforts that enables us to control and monitor its daily activities and
independent distributors for international sales. Our sales force is organized in seven territories. The direct territory sales team is supported by a
team of five inside sales representatives, and a tele-sales specialist and a pre-sales solution design team. We also have a bid specialist to coordinate
large bid opportunities. We believe our employee-based model encourages our sales personnel in lower performing territories to improve their
efforts and, consequently, their sales results. Our executive team also supports sales agents with significant customer opportunities by providing
pricing strategies and customer presentation assistance. Our technical support personnel may also provide sales agents with customer
presentations and product specifications in order to facilitate sales activities.
We use our direct sales force and international distributors to market our products. Our key promotional activities include:
● attendance at industry trade shows and conventions;
● direct sales, with a force of industry-specific sales individuals who identify, call upon and build on-going relationships with key
purchasers and targeted industries;
● support of our direct sales with passive sales systems, including inside sales and e-commerce;
● print advertising in journals with specialized industry focus;
● direct mail campaigns targeted to potential customers;
● web advertising, including supportive search engines and website and registration with appropriate sourcing entities;
● our NASCAR relationship is supportive of developing new business opportunities by and between the sponsors at NASCAR sponsored
events in addition to the races;
● public relations, industry-specific venues, as well as general media, to create awareness of our brand and our products, including
membership in appropriate trade organizations; and
● brand identification through trade names associated with us and our products.
Competition
The law enforcement and security surveillance markets are extremely competitive. Competitive factors in these industries include ease of
use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct competitors with technology and products in the law
enforcement and surveillance markets for all our products and those we have in development. Many of these competitors have significant
advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger
customer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors
in the in-car video systems market include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., WatchGuard, Kustom Signals, Panasonic System
Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell, or may in the future sell, in-car
video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include Axon, Reveal Media, WatchGuard
and VieVU, Inc., which was acquired by Axon in 2018. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our event recorders in the mass transit
markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. We will also compete with any company making surveillance devices
for commercial use. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance
that new and existing companies will not enter the law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future.
9

The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets likewise are also very competitive. There are direct competitors for our DVM-250
Plus “event recorders,” which several may have greater financial, technical marketing, and manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary
competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and SmartDrive Systems.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad.
We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our products.
Some of our patent applications are still under review by the USPTO and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all the patents that we
applied for in the United States. We were issued several patents in recent years, including a patent on our VuLink product that provides automatic
triggering of our body-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing
technology will be issued from the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any
patents in the future based on our continued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United
States will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies.
We have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our DVM-
250 and DVM-800 products. These supply and distribution agreements contain certain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary
technology, as well as that of the third-party manufacturers.
In addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve
and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements
with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively
protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop
substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
We filed lawsuits against Axon and WatchGuard to protect our various patents. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”
Employees
We had 119 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and we
have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations. Although there can be no assurances, based
on the information currently available, management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statement of the Company. However, an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have
a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company in the period in which it is recorded.
Axon
The Company owns U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the “ ‘452 Patent”), which generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of
multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event, such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.
The Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against Axon,
alleging willful patent infringement against Axon’s body camera product line and Signal auto-activation product. The Company is seeking both
monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Axon for infringement of the ‘452 Patent.
In December 2016 and January 2017, Axon filed two petitions for Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) against the ‘452 Patent. The United States
Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) rejected both of Axon’s petitions. Axon is now statutorily precluded from filing any more IPR petitions
against the ‘452 Patent.
The District Court litigation in Kansas was temporarily stayed following the filing of the petitions for IPR. However, on November 17, 2017,
the Federal District Court of Kansas rejected Axon’s request to maintain the stay. With this significant ruling, the parties will now proceed towards
trial. Since litigation has resumed, the Court has issued a claim construction order (also called a Markman Order) where it sided with the Company
on all disputes and denied Axon’s attempts to limit the scope of the claims. Following the Markman Order, the Court set all remaining deadlines in
the case. Fact discovery closed on October 8, 2018, and a Final Pretrial Conference took place on January 16, 2019. The parties filed motions for
summary judgment on January 31, 2019.
On June 17, 2019, the Court granted Axon’s motion for summary judgment that Axon did not infringe on the Company’s patent and dismissed
the case. Importantly, the Court’s ruling did not find that Digital’s ‘452 Patent was invalid. It also did not address any other issue, such as whether
Digital’s requested damages were appropriate, and it did not impact the Company’s ability to file additional lawsuits to hold other competitors
accountable for patent infringement. This ruling solely related to an interpretation of the claims as they relate to Axon and was unrelated to the
supplemental briefing Digital recently filed on its damages claim and the WatchGuard settlement. Those issues are separate and the judge’s ruling
on summary judgment had nothing to do with Digital’s damages request. The Company has filed an appeal to this ruling and has asked the
appellate court to reverse this decision.
The Company filed its Opening Appeal Brief on August 26, 2019 and Axon filed its Responsive Brief on November 6, 2019 and the Company
filed its Reply Brief responding to Axon on November 27, 2019. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit scheduled oral argument
on the Company’s appeal of the district court’s summary judgment order on April 6, 2020. This appeal is to address the incorrect and mistaken
dismissal of Digital Ally’s claims against Axon by Judge Carlos Murguia in the U.S. District Court of Kansas litigation. If the Court of Appeals
overturns the summary judgment ruling, a new judge will be assigned to handle the litigation with Axon due to the recent resignation of Judge
Murguia. On March 12, 2020, the panel of judges for the United States Court of Appeals issued an order cancelling the oral arguments previously
set for April 6, 2020 having determined that they will decide the appeal based on the parties’ briefs without oral argument.
WatchGuard
On May 27, 2016, the Company filed suit against WatchGuard, (Case No. 2:16-cv-02349-JTM-JPO) alleging patent infringement based on
WatchGuard’s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines.
11

On May 13, 2019, the parties resolved the dispute and executed a settlement agreement in the form of a Release and License Agreement. The
litigation has been dismissed as a result of this settlement.
The Release and License Agreement encompasses the following key terms:
● WatchGuard paid Digital Ally a one-time, lump settlement payment of $6,000,000.
● Digital Ally granted WatchGuard a perpetual covenant not to sue if WatchGuard’s products incorporate agreed-upon modified recording
functionality. Digital Ally also granted WatchGuard a license to the ‘292 Patent and the ‘452 Patent (and related patents, now existing and
yet-to-issue) through December 31, 2023. The parties agreed to negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve any alleged infringement that
occurs after the license period expires.
● The parties further agreed to release each other from all claims or liabilities pre-existing the settlement.
● As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that WatchGuard made no admission that it infringed any of Digital Ally’s patents.
Upon receipt of the $6,000,000 the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit which the Judge granted.
PGA Tour, Inc.
On January 22, 2019 the PGA Tour, Inc. (the “PGA”) filed suit against the Company in the Federal District Court for the District of Kansas
(Case No. 2:19-cv-0033-CM-KGG) alleging breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing relative to the Web.com
Tour Title Sponsor Agreement (the “Agreement”). The contract was executed on April 16, 2015 by and between the parties. Under the Agreement,
Digital Ally would be a title sponsor of and receive certain naming and other rights and benefits associated with the Web.com Tour for 2015
through 2019 in exchange for Digital Ally’s payment to Tour of annual sponsorship fees. The suit was resolved and the case has been dismissed by
Plaintiff with prejudice on April 17, 2019.
General
From time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not
disclose the specifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the
claim, and assuming we determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit
filed against us. We record a liability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but
not probable, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if
material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical
experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of
insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time.
While the ultimate resolution is unknown, we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be
no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance
or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, financial condition or cash flows.

shares of the common stock that is subject to restrictions on transferability, risk of forfeiture and other restrictions and that may be forfeited in the
event of certain terminations of employment or service prior to the end of a restricted period specified by the Compensation Committee.

15

Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those discussed herein or for our stock price to be
adversely affected include, but are not limited to: (1) our losses in recent years, including fiscal 2019 and 2018; (2) economic and other risks for our
business from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on our law-enforcement and commercial customers, suppliers and
employees and on our ability to raise capital as required; (3) our ability to increase revenues, increase our margins and return to consistent
profitability in the current economic and competitive environment; (4) our operation in developing markets and uncertainty as to market
acceptance of our technology and new products; (5) the availability of funding from federal, state and local governments to facilitate the budgets of
law enforcement agencies, including the timing, amount and restrictions on such funding; (6) our ability to deliver our new product offerings as
scheduled in 2020, such as the EVO-HD, have such new products perform as planned or advertised and whether they will help increase our
revenues; (7) whether we will be able to increase the sales, domestically and internationally, for our products in the future; (8) our ability to
maintain or expand our share of the market for our products in the domestic and international markets in which we compete, including increasing
our international revenues; (9) our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective manner; (10) competition from larger, more established
companies with far greater economic and human resources; (11) our ability to attract and retain quality employees; (12) risks related to dealing
with governmental entities as customers; (13) our expenditure of significant resources in anticipation of sales due to our lengthy sales cycle and the
potential to receive no revenue in return; (14) characterization of our market by new products and rapid technological change; (15) our dependence
on sales of our EVO-HD, DVM-800, FirstVU HD and DVM-250 products; (16) potential that stockholders may lose all or part of their investment if
we are unable to compete in our markets and return to profitability; (17) defects in our products that could impair our ability to sell our products or
could result in litigation and other significant costs; (18) our dependence on key personnel; (19) our reliance on third-party distributors and sales
representatives for part of our marketing capability; (20) our dependence on a few manufacturers and suppliers for components of our products
and our dependence on domestic and foreign manufacturers for certain of our products; (21) our ability to protect technology through patents and
to protect our proprietary technology and information as trade secrets and through other similar means; (22) our ability to generate more recurring
cloud and service revenues; (23) risks related to our license arrangements; (24) our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly
from quarter to quarter; (25) sufficient voting power by coalitions of a few of our larger stockholders, including directors and officers, to make
corporate governance decisions that could have significant effect on us and the other stockholders; (26) sale of substantial amounts of our common
stock that may have a depressive effect on the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (27) possible issuance of common stock
subject to options and warrants that may dilute the interest of stockholders; (28) our nonpayment of dividends and lack of plans to pay dividends in
the future; (29) future sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock that could depress the trading price of our common stock, lower
our value and make it more difficult for us to raise capital; (30) our additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely
affect the rights of the holders of our common stock; (31) our stock price is likely to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including a
relatively limited public float; (32) whether the litigation against Axon will achieve its intended objectives and result in monetary recoveries for us;
(33) whether the USPTO rulings will curtail, eliminate or otherwise have an effect on the actions of Axon and other competitors respecting us, our
products and customers; and (34) whether our patented VuLink technology is becoming the de-facto “standard” for agencies engaged in deploying
state-of-the-art body-worn and in-car camera systems and will increase our revenues; (36) whether such technology will have a significant impact
on our revenues in the long-term; (37) whether we will be able to meet the standards for continued listing on NASDAQ; and (38) indemnification of
our officers and directors.
Current Trends and Recent Developments for the Company
Overview
We supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities, for the law enforcement and
security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical,
and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include the DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, in-car
digital video mirror systems for law enforcement; the FirstVU and the FirstVU HD, body-worn cameras, our patented and revolutionary VuLink
product, which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation, for both law enforcement
and commercial markets; the DVM-250 and DVM-250 Plus, a commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the
commercial fleet and mass transit markets; and FleetVU and VuLink, our cloud-based evidence management systems. We introduced the EVO-HD
product in late June 2019 and began full-scale deployments in the third quarter 2019. It is designed and built on a new and highly advanced
technology platform that will become the platform for a new family of in-car video solution products for the law enforcement and commercial
markets. We believe that the launch of these new products will help to reinvigorate our in-car and body-worn systems revenues while diversifying
and broadening the market for our product offerings.

We experienced operating losses for all quarters during 2019 and 2018 except for the second quarter 2019 which was aided by a patent
litigation settlement. The following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly basis:

Our business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating
results in the above table. These variations result from various factors, including but not limited to: (1) the timing of large individual orders; (2) the
traction gained by products, such as the recently released EVO HD; (3) production, quality and other supply chain issues affecting our cost of goods
sold; (4) unusual increases in operating expenses, such as the timing of trade shows and stock-based and bonus compensation; (5) the timing of
patent infringement litigation settlements, such as the $6.0 settlement we obtained from WatchGuard during the second quarter 2019 and (5)
ongoing patent and other litigation and related expenses respecting outstanding lawsuits. We reported an operating loss of $3,233,819 on revenues
of $2,420,437 for fourth quarter 2019. The income recognized in the second quarter 2019 ended a series of quarterly losses resulting from
competitive pressures, supply chain problems, increases in inventory reserves as our current product suite ages, product quality control issues,
product warranty issues, infringement of our patents by direct competitors such as Axon that reduced our revenues, and litigation expenses
relating to the patent infringement.
The factors and trends affecting our recent performance include:
● On May 13, 2019 we reached a resolution of the pending patent infringement litigation with WatchGuard and executed a settlement
agreement that resulted in the dismissal of this case. As part of the settlement agreement, we received a one-time $6,000,000 payment
and granted WatchGuard a perpetual covenant to not sue WatchGuard if its products incorporate agreed-upon modified recording
functionality. Additionally, we granted it license to the ‘292 Patent and ‘452 Patent through December 31, 2023. As part of the
settlement, the parties agree that WatchGuard made no admission that it infringed any of our patents. See Note 12, “Contingencies” for
the details respecting the settlement.
● Revenues decreased in fourth quarter 2019 to $2,420,436 compared to the previous quarters. The primary reason for the revenue
decrease in the fourth quarter 2019 is that we continue to face increased challenges for our in-car and body-worn systems as our
competitors have released new products with advanced features and have maintained their product price cuts. We introduced a new
product platform, the EVO-HD, specifically for in-car systems late in June 2019 to address our competitors’ new product features and we
experienced some positive traction in third and fourth quarter 2019. However, we expect potential customers to review and test the
EVO-HD prior to adopting the new platform for deployment and therefore expect that the rate of adoption of the new technology will
accelerate in 2020. This new product platform utilizes advanced chipsets that will generate new and highly advanced products for our
law enforcement and commercial customers and we believe will improve product revenues in future quarters as customers become
aware of and commit to the new EVO-HD. Our law enforcement revenues declined over the prior period due to price-cutting, willful
infringement of our patents and other actions by our competitors and adverse marketplace effects related to the patent litigation. For
example, one of our competitors introduced a body-camera including cloud storage free for one year beginning in 2017 and this has
continued to pressure our revenues in 2019.
17

● Our objective is to expand our recurring service revenue to help stabilize our revenues on a quarterly basis. Revenues from cloud
storages have been increasing in recent quarters and reached approximately $205,714 in Q-4 2019, an increase of $12,714 (7%) over Q-
4 2018. Overall, cloud revenues increased to approximately $750,000 in 2019 compared to approximately $694,000 for 2018, an
increase of $56,000, or 8%. Additionally, revenues from extended warranties have also been increasing and were approximately
$405,179 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $301,000 for the prior year period for an increase of $104,179 (35%). We
are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers, such as
our NASCAR affiliation and event security solutions, which we believe will help expand the appeal of our products and service
capabilities to new commercial markets. If successful, we believe that these new market channels could yield recurring service revenues
for us in the future.
● Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, during 2014 we pioneered the development of our VuLink
ecosystem that provided intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The USPTO
granted us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating an officer’s cameras when the
light bar is activated or when a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated. Additionally, our patent claims cover
automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this innovation, officers were forced to manually activate each
device while responding to emergency scenarios - a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and
diverted officers’ attention during critical moments. We believe law enforcement agencies have recognized the value of our VuLink
technology and that a trend has developed where the agencies are seeking information on “auto-activation” features in requests for bids
and requests for information involving the procurement process of body-worn cameras and in-car systems. We believe this trend may
result in our patented VuLink technology becoming the de-facto “standard” for agencies engaged in deploying state-of-the-art body-worn
and in-car camera systems. However, the willful infringement of our VuLink patent by Axon and others has substantially and negatively
impacted revenues that otherwise would have been generated by our VuLink system and indirectly our body-worn and in-car systems.
We believe that the results of the current patent litigation with Axon will largely set the competitive landscape for body-worn and in-car
systems for the foreseeable future. We are seeking other ways to monetize our VuLink patents, which may include entering into license
agreements or supply and distribution agreements with competitors. We expect that this technology will have a significant positive
impact on our revenues in the long-term, particularly if we are successful in our prosecution of the patent infringement litigation
pending with Axon, and we can successfully monetize the underlying patents, although we can make no assurances in this regard.
● We have a multi-year official partnership with NASCAR, naming us “A Preferred Technology Provider of NASCAR.” As part of the
relationship, we will provide cameras that will be mounted in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series garage throughout the season,
bolstering both NASCAR’s commitment to safety at every racetrack, as well as enhancing its officiating process through technology. Our
relationship with NASCAR has yielded many new opportunities with NASCAR related sponsors. We believe this partnership with
NASCAR will demonstrate the flexibility of our product offerings and help expand the appeal of our products and service capabilities to
new commercial markets.
● Our international revenues decreased to $190,105 (2% of total revenues) during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to
$362,338 (3% of total revenues) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Political macro-economic tensions including illegal
immigration and import/export tariffs between the United States and many countries that have been our customers in the past have
made it a difficult climate for our international sales. The international sales cycle generally takes longer than domestic business and we
continue to provide bids to a number of international customers. We are actively marketing many of our products, including but not
limited to the EVO-HD, DVM-800, DVM-750, DVM-500+, FleetVu driver monitoring and management service and the FirstVU HD,
internationally. We saw an uptick in our international sales activity in 2020 as evidenced by the recent award of a contract with the
potential of over $4.0 million for our FirstVU HD by a sovereign nation’s national police force.

changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or
expenses.
We are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments (described in Note 12 to our
consolidated financial statements) and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future
payments for goods and services.

We sell our products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner:
● Sales to domestic customers are made directly to the end customer (typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer)
through our sales force, comprised of our employees. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer.
● Sales to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from us at a wholesale price and sell
to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor retains the margin as its
compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product inventory, customer receivables and all related
risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the
distribution agreement.
● Repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by our inside customer service employees.
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer.
We may discount our prices on specific orders based upon the size of the order, the specific customer and the competitive landscape.
Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were derived from the following sources:

Product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $7,732,796 and $9,130,911 respectively, a decrease of $1,398,115
(15%), due to the following factors:
● In general, we have experienced pressure on our revenues as our in-car and body-worn systems are facing increased competition
because our competitors have released new products with advanced features. Additionally, our law enforcement revenues declined
over the prior period due to price-cutting, willful infringement of our patents and other actions by our competitors, adverse
marketplace effects related to the patent litigation and supply chain issues. We introduced our EVO-HD late in second quarter 2019
with the goal of enhancing our product line features to meet these competitive challenges and we started to see traction in late 2019.
We expect customers and potential customers to review and test the EVO-HD prior to committing to this new product platform,
which may have delayed any meaningful positive impact to revenues until 2020.

● We shipped five individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $951,734 in revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared to six individual orders in excess of $100,000, for a total of approximately $984,450 in revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2018. Our average order size increased to approximately $2,259 in the year ended December 31, 2019
from $2,075 during the year ended December 31, 2018. For certain opportunities that involve multiple units and/or multi-year
contracts, we have occasionally discounted our products to gain or retain market share and revenues.
● Our international revenues decreased to $190,105 (2% of total revenues) during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to
$362,338 (3% of total revenues) during the year ended December 31, 2018. Political macro-economic tensions including illegal
immigration and import/export tariffs between the United States and many countries that have been our customers in the past have
made it a difficult climate for our international sales. The international sales cycle generally takes longer than domestic business and
we continue to provide bids to a number of international customers. We are actively marketing many of our products, including but
not limited to the EVO-HD, DVM-800, DVM-750, DVM-500+, FleetVu driver monitoring and management service and the FirstVU
HD, internationally. We have seen an uptick in our international sales activity in 2020 as evidenced by the recent award of a contract
with the potential over $4.0 million for our FirstVU HD by a sovereign nation’s national police force.
Service and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,708,568 and $2,160,498, respectively, an increase of
$548,070 (25%), due to the following factors:
● Cloud revenues were $749,713 and $693,653 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $56,060
(8%). We have experienced increased interest in our cloud solutions for law enforcement primarily due to the deployment of our new
cloud-based EVO-HD in-car system, which contributed to our increased cloud revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. We
expect this trend to continue for 2020 as the migration from local storage to cloud storage continues in our customer base.
● Revenues from extended warranty services were $1,414,308 and $1,106,289 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, an increase of $308,019 (28%). We have many customers that have purchased extended warranty packages, primarily
in our DVM-800 premium service program, and we expect the trend of increased revenues from these services to continue into 2020.
● Installation service revenues were $255,149 and $90,511 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase
of $164,638 (182%). Installation revenues tend to vary more than other service revenue types and are dependent on larger customer
implementations.
● Software revenue, non-warranty repair and other revenues were $289,398 and $270,045 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively, an increase of $19,353 (7%). Software revenues were $106,155 in 2019 compared to $115,458 in 2018 and non-
warranty repairs were $99,647 in 2019 compared to $106,910 in 2018. Situational security event fees were $64,800 in 2019
compared to $-0- in 2018.
Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $10,441,364 and $11,291,409, respectively, a decrease of $850,045
(8%), due to the reasons noted above.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of product revenue on units sold for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $6,577,347 and $6,805,897, respectively, a
decrease of $228,550 (3%). The decrease in product cost of goods sold is commensurate with the 15% decrease in product revenues coupled with
product cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to 85% in 2019 from 75% in 2018. We scrapped approximately $726,000 of inventory
and increased the reserve/expensed obsolete and excess inventories by approximately $856,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 due to
increased levels of excess component parts of older versions of PCB boards, used trade-in inventory requiring refurbishment and the phase-out of
our DVM-500, DVM-500 Plus, DVM, DVM-750 and LaserAlly legacy products.
22

Cost of service and other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $631,388 and $523,704, respectively, an increase
of $107,864 (21%). The increase in service and other cost of goods sold is commensurate with the 25% increase in service and other revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our cost of service and other revenue improved to 23.3% in 2019 compared to 24.2% in 2018.
Total cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 69% during the year ended December 31, 2019 from 65% for the year ended
December 31, 2018. We believe our gross margins will improve if we improve revenue levels, continue to reduce product warranty issues and add
higher margin revenues from cloud-based and other services.
We recorded $4,144,013 and $3,287,771 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018,
respectively. Total raw materials and component parts were $4,481,611 and $4,969,786 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018,
respectively, a decrease of $488,175 (10%). We scrapped older version inventory component parts that were mostly or fully reserved during the
year ended December 31, 2019 which was the primary cause for the decrease. Finished goods balances were $4,906,956 and $4,965,594 at
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $58,638 (1%). The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due to a
higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our PCB boards and the phase out of our DVM-750, DVM-500 Plus, DVM-500 and
LaserAlly legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at December 31, 2019.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3,232,629 and $3,961,808, respectively, a decrease of $729,179 (18%).
The decrease is commensurate with the 8% overall decline in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 coupled with a deterioration in the
overall cost of sales percentage to 69% during the year ended December 31, 2019 from 65% for the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe
that gross margins will improve during 2020 and beyond if we improve revenue levels primarily through the introduction of products such as the
EVO-HD, continue to reduce product warranty issues and shift our revenues to higher-margin cloud services. Our goal is to improve our margins to
60% over the longer term based on the expected margins of our EVO-HD, DVM-800, VuLink and FirstVU HD and our cloud evidence storage and
management offering, if they gain traction in the marketplace and we are able to increase our commercial market penetration in 2020. In addition,
if revenues from these products increase, we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently
utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components. We plan to continue our initiative to more efficient management of our supply chain through
outsourcing production, quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9,265,410 and $14,517,865 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, a decrease of $5,252,455 (36%). The significant decrease was fueled by the patent litigation settlement of $6.0 million we received in
second quarter 2019. Exclusive of the patent litigation settlement selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to
146% for 2019 compared to 129% in the same period in 2018. The significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses are as
follows:

Research and development expense. We continue to focus on bringing new products to market, including updates and improvements to
current products. Our research and development expenses totaled $2,005,717 and $1,444,063 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, an increase of $561,654 (39%). We employed 16 engineers at December 31, 2019 compared to 11 engineers at December 31, 2018,
most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products and primarily the EVO-HD, which was launched in late second
quarter 2019, and a commercial version of the EVO-HD, which we plan to launch in late 2020, and a non-mirror based DVM-250 that can be located
in multiple places in a vehicle. We expect our research and development activities will continue to trend higher in future quarters as we continue to
expand our product offerings based on our new EVO-HD product platform. We consider our research and development capabilities and new product
focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis and consistent with our financial resources.
Selling, advertising and promotional expenses. Selling, advertising and promotional expense totaled $3,652,434 and $2,797,793 for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $854,641 (31%). Salesman salaries and commissions represent the primary
components of these costs and were $2,632,729 and $2,413,680 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of
$219,049 (9%). The effective commission rate was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 21.4% for the year ended December
31, 2018. We increased the number of salesmen in our law enforcement and commercial channels in late 2018 and increased travel expenses in
2019 compared to 2018.
Promotional and advertising expenses totaled $1,019,705 during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $384,113 during the year
ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $635,592 (165%). The increase is primarily attributable to sponsorship of the NASCAR race in May 2019
and efforts to expand brand awareness and leverage our relationship with NASCAR for business opportunities.
Stock-based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense totaled $2,112,090 and $2,272,656 for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $160,566 (7%). The decrease is primarily due to the decreased amortization during the
year ended December 31, 2019 related to the restricted stock granted during 2019 and 2018 to our officers, directors, and other employees. We
relied more on stock-based compensation during 2019 and 2018 as we attempted to reduce cash expenses for liquidity reasons.
Professional fees and expense. Professional fees and expenses totaled $1,533,679 and $3,422,694 for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $1,889,015 (55%). The professional fees are primarily attributable to legal fees and expenses related to
the ongoing Axon lawsuit and the resolution of the WatchGuard and PGA lawsuits. We resolved the PGA lawsuit on April 17, 2019 and the
associated cost was accrued as of December 31, 2019 and the WatchGuard lawsuit was settled on May13, 2019. On June 17, 2019, the U.S. District
Court granted Axon’s Motion for Summary Judgment, which accepted Axon’s position that it did not infringe on our patent and dismissed the
lawsuit in its entirety. We have appealed the Court’s ruling and the oral arguments were set before the U.S. Court of Appeals on April 6, 2020.
However, on March 12, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an order cancelling the oral arguments on April 6, 2020 having determined that they will
decide the appeal based on the parties’ briefs without oral argument. Our spending on legal fees on the Axon case has slowed as we wait for the
appeal to be heard.
Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll. Executive, sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled $3,083,021 and
$2,139,687 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $943,334 (44%). The primary reason for the increase in
executive, sales and administrative staff payroll was an increase in staff from 95 at December 31, 2018 to 117 at December 31, 2019 and bonuses
paid to executives during 2019.
24

Patent litigation settlement. The income attributable to our patent litigation settlement with WatchGuard was $6.0 million and $-0- for
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On May 13, 2019 we reached a resolution of the litigation and executed a settlement
agreement that resulted in the dismissal of this case. As part of the agreement, we received a one-time $6.0 million payment and granted
WatchGuard a perpetual covenant to not sue WatchGuard if its products incorporate agreed-upon modified recording functionality. Additionally, we
granted it a license to the ‘292 Patent and ‘452 Patent through December 31, 2023. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that WatchGuard
made no admission that it had infringed on any of our patents. See Note 12, “Contingencies” for the details respecting the settlement.
Other. Other selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,878,469 and $2,440,972 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively, an increase of $437,497 (18%). The increase in other expenses in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to higher
contract employee expenses and travel costs. We have added several contract employees to our technical support teams during 2019.
Operating Loss
For the reasons previously stated, our operating loss was $6,032,781 and $10,556,057 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, an improvement of $4,523,276 (43%). Operating loss as a percentage of revenues decreased to 58% in 2019 from 94% in 2018.
Interest and Other Income
Interest income increased to $37,410 for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19,524 in 2018, which reflected our overall higher cash
and cash equivalent levels in 2019 compared to 2018.
Interest Expense
We incurred interest expense of $43,373 and $1,366,520 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease
was attributable to lower interest-bearing debt balances outstanding in 2019 as compared to 2018. We issued an aggregate of $2,778,000 principal
amount of secured convertible notes on August 5, 2019 bearing interest at 8% per annum on the outstanding principal balance. In May and April
2018, we issued an aggregate of $6,875,000 principal amount of secured convertible debentures (2018 Debentures) bearing interest at the rate of
8% per annum on the outstanding principal balance. We paid the 2018 Debentures in full on August 21, 2018, but were required to pay the
remaining 12 months of guaranteed interest on the Debentures, which included a 10% premium, because they were not retired before August 1,
2018. We issued an aggregate of $300,000 principal amount of Notes on December 23, 2019 bearing interest at 8% per annum on the outstanding
principal balance.
Change in Warrant Derivative Liabilities
We issued detachable warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 398,916 common shares, as adjusted, in conjunction with $2.0 million and
$4.0 million Secured Convertible Notes during March and August 2014. The warrants were required to be treated as derivative liabilities because
of their anti-dilution and down-round provisions. Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of such warrants as of their respective date of issuance
and recorded a corresponding derivative liability in the balance sheet. Upon exercise of the warrants we recognized a gain/loss based on the
closing market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. Certain common stock purchase warrants issued in August 2014
contained anti-dilution provisions that triggered a reset to their exercise price and number as a result of the April 2018 financing transaction. The
reset provisions resulted in the 12,200 warrants held at an exercise price of $7.32 per share increased by 159,538 warrants resulting in a final
reset to 172,038 warrants at an exercise price of $0.52 per share.
The holder of the warrants exercised its option to purchase common stock for all remaining outstanding warrants during the year ended
December 31, 2018 at the reset exercise price of $.52 per share. The net change in fair value of the warrants to the closing market price on their
respective date of exercise resulted in a net charge to change in warrant derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $319,105.
25

There remained no warrants classified as derivative liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2018; therefore, the respective warrant
derivative liability balance was $0 at December 31, 2018. Furthermore, no similar instruments were outstanding during the year ended December
31, 2019.
Change in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Notes
We elected to account for the secured convertible notes that were issued in August of 2019 on its fair value basis. Therefore, we determined
the fair value of the secured convertible notes as of their issuance date and as of December 31, 2019 to be $1,845,512 and $1,593,809,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the holders converted an aggregate of $648,067of convertible note principal. The change
in fair value from the issuance date of August 5, 2019 and December 31, 2019 was $519,821, which was recognized as a charge in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations at December 31, 2019.
Change in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Debentures
We elected to account for the $4.0 million principal amount of 2016 Debentures that we retired on April 3, 2018 on their fair value basis.
The change in fair value of the debentures was $12,807 during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recognized as a gain in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. We paid these Debentures on April 3, 2018 so there was no similar fair value change in the year ended
December 31, 2019.
We elected to account for the $6.875 million principal amount of 2018 Debentures issued in April and May 2018 on their fair value basis.
Therefore, we determined the fair value of the 2018 Debentures which yielded an estimated fair value of $4,565,749 including their embedded
derivatives as of their origination date. We also determined the estimated fair value of $5,354,803 for the 2018 Debentures including their
embedded derivatives as of June 30, 2018. We paid the 2018 Debentures on August 21, 2018 in full and the change in fair value of the 2018
Debentures from origination date to August 21, 2018 was $2,309,251, which was recognized as a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The net charge to change in fair value of secured debentures for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $-0- compared to $2,296,444 for
the year ended December 31, 2018.
Change in Fair Value of Proceeds Investment Agreement
We elected to account for the PIA that was entered into July of 2018 on its fair value basis. Therefore, we determined the fair value of the 2018
PIA as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018 to be $6,500,000 and $9,142,000, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019,
we settled our patent infringement litigation with WatchGuard and received a lump sum payment of $6.0 million as further described in Note 12. In
accordance with the terms of the PIA, we remitted the $6.0 million as a principal payment toward our minimum return payment obligations under
the PIA. The change in fair value from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was $3,358,000, which was recognized as a loss in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations at December 31, 2019.
In July 2018 we determined the fair value of the 2018 PIA was an estimated fair value of $9,067,513 as of its origination date. We also
determined the estimated fair value was $9,142,000 for the PIA as of December 31, 2018. The change in fair value from origination date until
December 31, 2018 was $74,487, which was recognized as a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations at December 31, 2018.
Loss on Extinguishment of Secured Convertible Debentures
The Board of Directors approved the Private Placement of $6.875 million of debentures and 806,667 Warrants exercisable to purchase 916,667
shares of our common stock. The Private Placement closed on April 3, 2018.
26

The Private Placement resulted in gross proceeds of $6.25 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the
transaction. A portion of the proceeds was used to repay in full the Debentures issued in December 2016, which matured on March 30, 2018, and
approximately $758,500 principal amount of the June Note and Secured Note that matured in March 2018. The balance of the proceeds was used
for working capital purposes.
In conjunction with the transaction we recorded a loss on extinguishment of the secured convertible debentures totaling $600,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2018. There was no similar extinguishment of secured convertible debentures in 2019.
Secured Convertible Debentures Issuance Expenses
We elected to account for and record our secured convertible notes issued in August 2019 on a fair value basis. Accordingly, we were
required to expense the related issuance costs to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Such costs totaled $89,148 for 2019.
We elected to account for and record our $6.875 million Secured Convertible Debenture issued in April and May 2018 on a fair value basis.
Accordingly, we were required to expense the related issuance costs to other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Such costs
totaled $351,462 for 2018. The issuance costs included a $150,000 placement agent fee and the remainder was primarily legal fees.
Loss before Income Tax Benefit
As a result of the above, we reported a loss before income tax benefit of $10,005,713 and $15,544,551 for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively, an improvement of $5,538,838 (36%).
Income Tax Benefit
We recorded an income tax benefit of $-0- for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for both
2019 and 2018 varied from the expected statutory rate due to our continuing to provide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. We
determined that it was appropriate to continue the full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 primarily
because of the recurring operating losses.
We have further determined to continue providing a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019. During
2019, we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by $2,100,000 whereby our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved due to
our recent operating losses.
We had approximately $67,100,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and $1,795,000 of research and development tax credit
carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 available to offset future net taxable income.
Net Loss
As a result of the above, we reported net losses of $10,005,713 and $15,544,551 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, an improvement of $5,538,838 (36%).
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
The basic and diluted loss per share was $0.87 and $1.93 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the reasons
previously noted. All outstanding stock options and common stock purchase warrants were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the
calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 because of the net loss reported for each period.
27

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern
Overall:
Management’s Liquidity Plan. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred substantial
operating losses in recent years due to the factors cited elsewhere in this Report and has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise
funding through the issuance of debt and equity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company settled one of its patent infringement
cases and received a lump sum payment of $6.0 million, which it used to pay its obligations under the PIA as more fully described in Note 12. In
recent years the Company has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise funding through the issuance of debt and equity. In that
regard, the Company raised net proceed of approximately $2,500,000 through issuances of secured convertible debt, $300,000 through the
issuance of unsecured note payable, and $1,564,000 from the exercise of warrants in the year ended December 31, 2019. In fiscal 2018 the
Company raised capital through the issuance of subordinated debt, secured debt and the PIA totaling $16,500,000, and net proceeds of $7,324,900
from an underwritten public offering of common stock. These debt and equity raises were utilized to fund its operations and management expects
to continue this pattern until it achieves positive cash flows from operations, although it can offer no assurance in this regard.
The Company will have to restore positive operating cash flows and profitability over the next year and/or raise additional capital to fund its
operational plans, meet its customary payment obligations and otherwise execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will be
successful in restoring positive cash flows and profitability, or that it can raise additional debt or equity financing when needed and obtain it on
terms acceptable or favorable to the Company.
If we must further supplement our liquidity to support our operations in 2020, given our recent history of net operating losses and negative
cash flows, we do not believe that traditional banking indebtedness would be available to us given our recent operating history. Our 2020 operating
plan could include raising additional capital a public offering or a private placement of debt or equity, all of which are under consideration as part
of our strategic alternatives. We demonstrated our ability to raise new debt or equity capital in 2019 and recent years. If necessary, we believe that
we could raise additional capital during the next 12 months if required, but we can offer no assurances in this regard.
On March 3, 2020, the Company consummated an underwritten public offering of 2,521,740 shares of common stock (the “Offering”). The
common shares in the Offering were sold at a public offering price of $1.15 per share. The Company has granted the Underwriters a 45-day option
to purchase up to an additional 378,261 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and
commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and other estimated offering expenses, and assuming the Underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase the option shares,
were approximately $2.9 million. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
the non-accountable expense reimbursement, but before deducting other expenses in connection with the offering, and assuming the Underwriters
do not exercise their option to purchase the option Shares, are approximately $2.67 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this
offering to fund the repayment of debt and for general corporate purposes.
We had warrants outstanding exercisable to purchase 4,824,573 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price $5.15 per share
outstanding as of December 31, 2019. In addition, there are common stock options outstanding exercisable to purchase 589,125 shares at an
average price of $3.74 per share. We could potentially use such outstanding warrants to provide near-term liquidity if we could induce their holders
to exercise their warrants by adjusting/lowering the exercise price on a temporary or permanent basis if the exercise price was below the then
market price of our common stock, although we can offer no assurances in this regard. Ultimately, we must restore profitable operations and
positive cash flows to provide liquidity to support our operations and, if necessary, to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms in 2020,
although we can offer no assurances in this regard.
Our Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum
financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee
requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards. See “Nasdaq Listing” below.
28

Based on the uncertainties described above, we believe our business plan does not alleviate the existence of substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the audited consolidated financial statements in this Report are filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
We had $359,685 of available cash and equivalents and net working capital of $764,934 as of December 31, 2019. Net working capital as of
December 31, 2019 included approximately $1.1 million of accounts receivable and $5.3 million of current inventory.
Cash, cash equivalents: As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of $359,685, a decrease
from a balance of $3,598,807 at December 31, 2018. Summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections
are the main elements of the $3,239,122 net decrease in cash during the year ended December 31, 2019:
● Operating$1,124,373 of net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $1,124,373 and $9,011,857
activities:for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an improvement of $7,887,484. The improvement was
primarily the result of our improved operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and increases
in accounts payable and decreases of accounts receivable offset by a decrease in accrued expenses. Our goal is to increase
revenues, return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during the 2020, thereby providing positive cash flows
from operations, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this regard.
● Investing $266,144 of net cash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $266,144 and $70,948 for the years
activities:ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively. In 2019 and 2018, we incurred costs for tooling of new products, an
integrated display system and for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included
in intangible assets.
● Financing$1,848,605 of net cash used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $1,884,605 and for the year ended
activities:December 31, 2019 compared to cash provided by $12,126,900 for the year ended December 31, 2018. On December 23,
2019, we received proceeds of $300,000 from the issuance of the unsecured promissory note payable and on August 5, 2019,
we received net proceeds of $2,500,000 from the issuance of the 2019 secured convertible notes. We also received
$1,564,000 of proceeds in 2019 from the exercise of common stock purchase warrants. The primary reason for the cash used
in financing activities is related to the repayment of $6.0 million of the PIA obligation with proceeds from the WatchGuard
patent litigation settlement received in May 2019.
The net result of these activities was a decrease in cash of $3,239,122 to $359,685 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Commitments:
We had $359,686 of cash and cash equivalents and net positive working capital $764,934 as of December 31, 2019. Accounts receivable
balances represented $1,071,018 of our net working capital at December 31, 2019. We intend to collect our outstanding receivables on a timely
basis and reduce the overall level during 2020, which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during 2020. Inventory
represented $5,280,412 of our net working capital at December 31, 2019 and finished goods represented $4,481,611 of total current and non-
current inventory. We are actively managing the level of inventory and our goal is to reduce such level during 2020 by our sales activities, the
increase of which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during 2020.
29

Capital Expenditures. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2019.
Lease commitments- The Company entered into an operating lease with a third party in September 2012 for office and warehouse space in
Lenexa, Kansas. The terms of the lease include monthly payments ranging from $38,026 to $38,533 with a maturity date of April 2020. The
Company has the option to renew for an additional three years beyond the original expiration date, which may be exercised at the Company’s sole
discretion. The Company evaluated the renewal option at the lease commencement date to determine if it is reasonably certain the exercise the
option and concluded that it is not reasonably certain that any options will be exercised. The weighted average remaining lease term for the
Company’s office and warehouse operating lease as of December 31, 2019 was four months.
The Company entered into an operating lease with a third party in October 2019 for copiers used for office and warehouse purposes. The terms
of the lease include 48 monthly payments of $1,598 with a maturity date of October 2023. The Company has the option to Purchase the equipment
at maturity for its estimated fair market value at that point in time. The remaining lease term for the Company’s copier operating lease as of
December 31, 2019 was 46 months.
Lease expense related to the office space and copier operating leases was recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease
expense under the two operating leases was approximately $400,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The discount rate implicit within the Company’s operating leases was not generally determinable and therefore the Company determined the
discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate on the information available at commencement date. As of commencement date, the
operating lease liabilities reflect a weighted average discount rate of 8%.
The following sets forth the operating lease right of use assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019:
Assets:
Operating lease right of use assets $ 122,459
Liabilities:
Operating lease obligations-current portion $ 159,160
Operating lease obligations-less current portion $ 44,460
Total operating lease obligations $ 203,620
Following are the minimum lease payments for each year and in total.
Year ending December 31:
2020 $ 173,307
2021 19,176
2022 19,176
2023 15,980
Total undiscounted minimum future lease payments 227,639
Imputed interest (24,019)
Total operating lease liability $ 203,620
License agreements. We have several license agreements under which we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials
used in our products. Certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the
licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $-0 and $2,083 for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2018, respectively.
30

Litigation.
From time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose
the specifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and
assuming we determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against
us. We record a liability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not
probable, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material
for disclosure. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with
matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the
severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time.
While the ultimate resolution is unknown we do not expect that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be
no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance
or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, financial condition or cash flows. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for information on our litigation.
NASDAQ Listing.
Our Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum
financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee
requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.
If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our Common Stock
could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or
the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our Common Stock, and
there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional
capital if we are not listed on Nasdaq or a major exchange.
On July 11, 2019, Nasdaq notified us that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities
(the “MVLS”) for our Common Stock was below the $35 million minimum MVLS requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(2) (the “MVLS Rule”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we had 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2020, to
regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. To regain compliance with the MVLS Rule, the minimum MVLS for our Common Stock must have been at
least $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during this 180-day period. If we failed to regain compliance with such
rule by January 7, 2020, we were subject to being be delisted from Nasdaq. If we were delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common
Stock may lose liquidity, increase volatility, and lose market maker support.
On January 8, 2020, we received a determination letter from the staff of Nasdaq stating that we had not regained compliance with the MVLS
Standard, since our Common Stock was below the $35 million minimum MVLS requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under the MLVS Rule
and had not been at least $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day grace period granted to us.
Pursuant to the letter, unless we requested a hearing to appeal this determination by January 15, 2020, our Common Stock would be delisted from
Nasdaq and trading of our Common Stock would have been suspended at the opening of business on January 17, 2020.
On January 13, 2020, we requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Letter and the Staff of Nasdaq notified us that
a hearing was scheduled for February 20, 2020. We were asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance with the minimum MLVS
requirement under the MLVS Rule, which needed to include a discussion of the events that we believe will enable us to timely regain compliance
with the minimum MLVS requirement. On January 21, 2020, we submitted such a compliance plan.
31

On March 6, 2020, we received notice from the NASDAQ hearing panel that we have been granted an extension until June 30, 2020 to
regain compliance with Rule 5550(b), which requires us to have at least i) $2.5 million in shareholder equity; or ii) $35 million in market value of
listed securities, or iii) net income from continuing operations of at least $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last
three fiscal years. Our goal is to meet the $2.5 million minimum shareholder equity requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. There can be no
assurance that we will regain compliance with the NASDAQ’s Listing Rule regarding our $2.5 million minimum shareholder equity requirement on
or prior to the June 30, 2020 required date. Furthermore, even if we regain compliance on or prior to such date, we must thereafter continue to
maintain compliance with such continued listing rule.
401 (k) Plan. The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan, as amended, requires it to
provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching
contributions for employee’s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company made matching contributions totaling $108,688
and $112,622 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and
employer matching contributions.
Consulting and Distributor Agreements. The Company entered into an agreement that required it to make monthly payments that will
be applied to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider. The agreement is with a limited liability company (“LLC”)
that is minority owned by a relative of the Company’s chief financial officer. Under the agreement, dated January 15, 2016 and as amended on
February 13, 2017, the LLC provides consulting services for developing a new distribution channel outside of law enforcement for its body-worn
camera and related cloud storage products to customers in the United States. The Company advanced amounts to the LLC against commissions
ranging from $5,000 to $6,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for the period through June 30, 2017, which can be
automatically extended based on the LLC achieving minimum sales quotas. The agreement was renewed in January 2017 for a period of three
years, subject to yearly minimum sales thresholds that would allow the Company to terminate the contract if such minimums were not met. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company had advanced a total of $274,731 pursuant to this agreement and established an allowance reserve of $224,731
for a net advance of $50,000. The minimum sales threshold was not been met and the Company discontinued all advances, although the contract
has not been formally terminated. However, the exclusivity provisions of the agreement have been terminated.
On June 1, 2018 the Company entered into an agreement with an individual that required it to make monthly payments that will be applied
to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider. Under the agreement, the individual provides consulting services for
developing new distribution channels both inside and outside of law enforcement for its in-car and body-worn camera systems and related cloud
storage products to customers within and outside the United States. The Company was required to advance amounts to the individual as an
advance against commissions of $7,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for the period through August 31, 2018, which was
extended to December 31, 2018 by mutual agreement of the parties at $6,000 per month. The parties have mutually agreed to further extend the
arrangement on a monthly basis at $5,000 per month. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had advanced a total of $53,332 pursuant to this
agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1, “Financial
Statements”, of this report. While the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and
estimates, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements, potentially involve the most subjective
judgments in their selection and application, and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions:
● Revenue Recognition / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts;
● Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory;
32

● Warranty Reserves;
● Stock-based Compensation Expense;
● Accounting for Income Taxes;
● Determination of Fair Value Calculation for Financial Instruments and Derivatives; and
● Going Concern Analysis.
Revenue Recognition / Allowances for Doubtful Accounts. Revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service
when all four of the following conditions are met:
(i) Identify the contract with the customer;
(ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii) Determine the transaction price;
(iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(v) Recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
We consider the terms and conditions of the contract and our customary business practices in identifying our contracts under ASC 606. We
determine we have a contract when the customer order is approved, we can identify each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred,
we can identify the payment terms for the services, we have determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has
commercial substance. At contract inception we evaluate whether the contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment
in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment
experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services and the products that will be transferred to the
customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the
services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Our performance obligations consist of (i) products, (ii)
professional services, and (iii) extended warranties.
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the
customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment it is probable that a significant future reversal of
cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component.
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the
relative standalone selling price (“SSP”).
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a
customer. Revenue is recognized when control of the service is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we
expect to receive in exchange for our services. We generate all our revenue from contracts with customers.
We review all significant, unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and
financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a
customer purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as contract liability and recognized over the term of the extended
warranty.

Our principal customers are state, local and federal law enforcement agencies, which historically have been low risks for uncollectible
accounts. However, we have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such
law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances. Our historical bad debts have
been negligible, with less than $198,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $228.4 million since we commenced deliveries
during 2006. As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $123,224 and $70,000,
respectively. Our historical bad debts have been negligible, with less than $258,000 charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of $238.9
million since we commenced deliveries during 2006. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of
$123,224 and $70,000, respectively.
We periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility. Based on
such review, we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of December 31, 2019. However, should the balance due from any
significant customer ultimately become uncollectible then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge-off and we will be
required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations.
Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory. We record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory
items. The amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. On a quarterly basis, management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to
identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence. Management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis.
In addition, we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost.
Inventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2019 and 2018:
December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018
Raw material and component parts $ 4,481,611 $ 4,969,786
Work-in-process 35,858 351,451
Finished goods 4,906,956 4,965,594
Subtotal 9,424,425 10,286,831
Reserve for excess and obsolete inventory (4,144,013) (3,287,771)
Total inventories $ 5,280,412 $ 6,999,060
We balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of
inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements. As reflected above, our inventory reserves represented 38.2% of
the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2019, compared to 32.0% of the gross inventory balance at December 31, 2018. We had $4,144,013
and $3,287,771 in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Total raw materials
and component parts were $4,481,611 and $4,969,786 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $488,175 (10%).
The reduction in raw materials was the result of tighter inventory controls together with reductions in the level of FirstVU HD inventory levels.
Finished goods balances were $4,906,956 and $4,965,594 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, a decrease of $58,638 (1%).
The decrease in finished goods was primarily related to reductions in our DVM-750 product line, and test and evaluation and replacement
inventory. The increase in the inventory reserve is primarily due a higher level of excess component parts of the older versions of our PCB boards
and the phase out of our DVM-750, DVM-500 Plus and LaserAlly legacy products. We believe the reserves are appropriate given our inventory
levels at December 31, 2019.
If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to
our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in excess of the inventory
reserves already established.
34

Warranty Reserves. We generally provide up to a two-year parts and labor standard warranty on our products to our customers. Provisions
for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical
information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and
minimize claims. Our warranty reserves were decreased to $17,838 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $195,135 as of December 31, 2018 as we
continue to reduce our warranty exposures through the roll-off of DVM-750 and DVM-800 units from warranty coverage. Standard warranty
exposure on the DVM-800 and DVM-250plus are the responsibility of the contract manufacturers which reduced our overall warranty exposure as
these are very popular products in our line. There is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than
our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products on our new products for which we have limited experience. Actual experience could differ
from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods.
Stock-based Compensation Expense. We grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share-based
payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share-based compensation. Our expected
stock-price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock that are obtained from public data sources and there were
180,000 stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019.
If factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ
significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. There is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to
estimate share-based compensation. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values of our share-
based compensation. Certain share-based payment awards, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero
intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, values may
be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our
financial statements. Although the fair value of employee share-based awards is determined using an established option pricing model, that value
may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. In addition, we account for forfeitures as they
occur.
Accounting for Income Taxes. Accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.
Such estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to
reverse in the future, the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses
currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit.
As required by authoritative guidance, we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Authoritative
guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018, cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of $21,500,000 were recorded in
connection with the net deferred income tax assets. Based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance, we determined
that our valuation allowance should be increased by $2,100,000 to a balance of $23,600,000 to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at December
31, 2019. We determined that it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation reserve on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31,
2019 because of the overall net operating loss carryforwards available. We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we
determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. To the extent we determine that the
realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation
allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and, for some portion related to deductions for stock option
exercises, an increase in shareholders’ equity.
As required by authoritative guidance, we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance
with recognition standards established by the FASB, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed
tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting
purposes. We have no recorded liability as of December 31, 2019 representing uncertain tax positions.
35

We have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense
taken for stock options, certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. For us to realize the income tax benefit of these
assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes. In some cases
where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options, our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these
assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value
and are exercised. In assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets, we have evaluated our
ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets. We continue to evaluate our
ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances. If we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years, no
additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses, since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to
utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Therefore, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should
our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized.
Determination of Fair Value for Financial Instruments and Derivatives. During 2019 we entered into the 2019 secured convertible
notes and we elected to record them on their fair value basis. During 2018 we entered into the Proceeds Investment Agreement (PIA) and we
elected to record the PIA, on its fair value basis. In accordance with ASC Topic 820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), the
Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as
a business.
ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
The following is a brief description of those three levels:
● Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
● Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)
● Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value)
The following table represents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2019.

Going Concern Analysis.
In accordance with ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) – Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our financials are issued.
When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider
whether its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt
about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management’s plans, the entity should
disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised the substantial doubt, management’s
evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management’s plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
We performed the analysis and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate as of December 31,
2019, which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was not adequately
mitigated by our plans to address the substantial doubt as disclosed in Note 1: Management’s Liquidity Plan and going concern.
Inflation and Seasonality
Inflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year. We do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature; however, we
generally generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our financial statements are included as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K commencing on page F-1.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
On June 19, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, approved the engagement of RBSM, LLP (“RBSM”) as the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and dismissed RSM US LLP
(“RSM”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.
RSM’s audit reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles, except that RSM’s audit reports for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 contained an emphasis of a matter regarding the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, and the subsequent interim periods through June 19, 2019, there were (i) no
disagreements (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and RSM on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to RSM’s satisfaction,
would have caused RSM to make reference thereto in its reports on the financial statements for such years, and (ii) no “reportable events” within
the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

Item 9A.Controls and Procedures.
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving the control objectives, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their
evaluation as of December 31, 2019, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including this Annual Report, were
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and was accumulated and
communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
● Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets;
● Provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
● Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by 2013 Internal Control –
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment using the
framework in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework, management believes that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over
financial reporting is effective.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2019, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Digital Ally, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statement
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Digital Ally, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, the
related consolidated statement of operation, stockholders’ deficit and cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes to the
consolidated financial statement (collectively, the financial statement). In our opinion, the financial statement present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and the results of its operation and its cash flow for the year then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 and 12 to the financial statement, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of
ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended, effective January 1, 2019, using the optional transitional method and elected to use the package
of three practical expedients which allows the Company not to reassess whether contracts are or contain leases, lease classification and whether
initial direct costs qualify for capitalization.
Emphasis of Matter Regarding Going Concern
The accompanying financial statement have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statement, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and this raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 1. The financial statement do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statement are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statement based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

DIGITAL ALLY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business:
Digital Ally, Inc. and subsidiary (collectively, “Digital Ally,” “Digital,” and the “Company”) produces digital video imaging and storage products
for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. Its products are an in-car digital video/audio recorder contained in a rear-view
mirror for use in law enforcement and commercial fleets; a system that provides its law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from
multiple vantage points and hands-free automatic activation of body-worn cameras and in-car video systems; a miniature digital video system
designed to be worn on an individual’s body; and cloud storage solutions. The Company has active research and development programs to adapt its
technologies to other applications. It can integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique
solutions to address needs in a variety of other industries and markets, including mass transit, school bus, taxicab and the military. The Company
sells its products to law enforcement agencies, private security customers and organizations and consumer and commercial fleet operators through
direct sales domestically and third-party distributors internationally.
The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. and had no operations until 2004. On
November 30, 2004, Vegas Petra, Inc. entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., at which time the merged entity was renamed Digital
Ally, Inc.
Management’s Liquidity Plan and Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred operating losses in the year ended December 31,
2019 and substantial operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to reduced revenues and gross margins caused by
competitors’ willful infringement of its patents, specifically the auto-activation of body-worn and in-car video systems, and by competitors’
introduction of newer products with more advanced features together with significant price cutting of their products. The Company incurred net
losses of approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $15.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and it had
an accumulated deficit of $87.4 million as of December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company settled one of its patent
infringement cases and received a lump sum payment of $6.0 million, which was used to pay its obligations under its Proceeds Investment
Agreement as more fully described in Note 12. In recent years the Company has accessed the public and private capital markets to raise funding
through the issuance of debt and equity. In that regard, the Company raised $1,564,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the exercise of
warrants, the Company borrowed $300,000 pursuant to a short-term promissory note payable on December 23, 2019 with detachable warrants to
purchase 107,000 shares of common stock and on August 5, 2019, the Company raised funds from the issuance of $2.78 million principal balance of
secured convertible notes with detachable warrants to purchase 571,248 shares of common stock with the net proceeds being used for working
capital purposes as more fully described in Note 6. Additionally, the Company raised funding in the form of subordinated debt, secured debt and
Proceeds Investment Agreement totaling $16,500,000 and net proceeds of $7,324,900 from an underwritten public offering of common stock
during the year ended December 31, 2018. These debt and equity raises were utilized to fund its operations and management expects to continue
this pattern until it achieves positive cash flows from operations, although it can offer no assurance in this regard.
The Company settled its lawsuit with the PGA Tour and the case was dismissed by the Plaintiff with prejudice on April 17, 2019. Additionally,
the Company settled its lawsuit with WatchGuard on May 13, 2019 and the case was dismissed. See Note 12, “Contingencies” for the details
respecting the settlements.
The Company will have to restore positive operating cash flows and profitability over the next year and/or raise additional capital to fund its
operational plans, meet its customary payment obligations and otherwise execute its business plan. There can be no assurance that it will be
successful in restoring positive cash flows and profitability, or that it can raise additional financing when needed, and obtain it on terms acceptable
or favorable to the Company.
F-8

The Company has increased its addressable market to non-law enforcement customers and obtained new non-law enforcement contracts in
2019 and 2018, which contracts include recurring revenue during the period 2020 to 2023. The Company believes that its quality control and cost
cutting initiatives, expansion to non-law enforcement sales channels and new product introduction will eventually restore positive operating cash
flows and profitability, although it can offer no assurances in this regard.
In addition to the initiatives described above, the Board of Directors is conducting a review of a full range of strategic alternatives to best
position the Company for the future including, but not limited to, monetizing its patent portfolio and related patent infringement litigation against
Axon Enterprise, Inc. (“Axon” formerly Taser International, Inc.), the sale of all or certain assets, properties or groups of properties or individual
businesses or merger or combination with another company. The result of this review may also include the continued implementation of the
Company’s business plan. The Company’s August 5, 2019 issuance of $2.78 million principal balance of convertible notes was part of this strategic
alternatives review. The Company has an active shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which it utilized to raise $2.9 million in gross proceeds
through the issuance of 2,521,740 common shares in an underwritten public offering at $1.15 per share on March 3, 2020. While such funding
addressed the Company’s near-term liquidity needs, it continues to consider strategic alternatives to address longer-term liquidity needs and
operational issues. There can be no assurance that any additional transactions or financings will result from this process.
Based on the uncertainties described above, the Company believes its business plan does not alleviate the existence of substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or
the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The following is a summary of the Company’s Significant Accounting Policies:
Basis of Consolidation:
The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Digital Ally and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally
International, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated during consolidation.
The Company formed Digital Ally International, Inc. during August 2009 to facilitate the export sales of its products.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
subordinated notes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The Company accounts for its derivative
liabilities, secured convertible debentures and proceeds investment agreement on a fair value basis.
Revenue Recognition:
The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all
related appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to its customers in an
amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following
five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction
price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is
satisfied.
F-9

The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with
the customer. In situation where sales are to a distributor, the Company had concluded its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds
a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of part of its consideration for the contract, the Company
evaluates certain factors including the customers’ ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer
products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates
whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled. As the Company’s
standard payment terms are less than one year, it has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has
a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling
price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the
price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer
(i.e. when the Company’s performance obligations is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. Further in determining whether control has
been transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having
transferred to the customer. Customers do not have a right to return the product other than for warranty reasons for which they would only receive
repair services or replacement product. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions for
product sales when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one
year.
The Company sells its products and services to law enforcement and commercial customers in the following manner:
● Sales to domestic customers are made direct to the end customer (typically a law enforcement agency or a commercial customer)
through its sales force, which is composed of its employees. Revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer.
● Sales to international customers are made through independent distributors who purchase products from the Company at a
wholesale price and sell to the end user (typically law enforcement agencies or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The
distributor retains the margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor generally maintains product
inventory, customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership. Accordingly, upon application of steps one through
five above, revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution
agreement.
● Repair parts and services for domestic and international customers are generally handled by its inside customer service employees.
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the repair parts and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer.
F-10

Sales taxes collected on products sold are excluded from revenues and are reported as accrued expenses in the accompanying balance
sheets until payments are remitted.
Service and other revenue is comprised of revenues from extended warranties, repair services, cloud revenue and software revenue.
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance of the service or materials by the end customer for repair services. Revenue
for extended warranty, cloud service or other software-based products is over the term of the contract warranty or service period. A time-elapsed
method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed
consideration related to these revenues is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, as long as the other revenue
recognition criteria have been met.
Contracts with some of the Company’s customers contain multiple performance obligations that are distinct and accounted for separately.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). The Company determined
SSP for all the performance obligations using observable inputs, such as standalone sales and historical pricing. SSP is consistent with the
Company’s overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration the type of service being provided. SSP also reflects the amount the Company would
charge for the performance obligation if it were sold separately in a standalone sale. Multiple performance obligations consist of product, software,
cloud subscriptions and extended warranties.
The Company’s multiple performance obligations may include future in-car or body-worn camera devices to be delivered at defined points
within a multi-year contract, and in those arrangements, the Company allocates total arrangement consideration over the life of the multi-year
contract to future deliverables using management’s best estimate of selling price.
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are
reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts consist of extended warranty
contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the respective performance obligations are
satisfied. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $1.7 million related to its contract liabilities at January 1,
2018. Total contract liabilities consist of the following: Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of
performance under the contract and are reported separately as current liabilities and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Such amounts consist of extended warranty contracts, prepaid cloud services and prepaid installation services and are generally recognized as the
respective performance obligations are satisfied. Total contract liabilities consist of the following:
December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018
Contract liabilities, current $ 1,707,943 $ 1,748,789
Contract liabilities, non-current 1,803,143 1,991,091
Total contract liabilities $ 3,511,086 $ 3,739,880
Sales returns and allowances aggregated $134,825 and $132,477 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Obligations
for estimated sales returns and allowances are recognized at the time of sales on an accrual basis. The accrual is determined based upon historical
return rates adjusted for known changes in key variables affecting these return rates.
F-11

Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were derived from the following sources:

Accessories and other revenues 1,591,077 1,146,777
$ 10,441,364 $ 11,291,409
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management utilizes various other estimates, including but not limited to determining the
estimated lives of long-lived assets, determining the potential impairment of long-lived assets, the fair value of warrants, options, proceeds
investment agreement and convertible debt, the recognition of revenue, inventory valuation reserve, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
and other legal claims and contingencies. The results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period
in which the changes become evident. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period
that they are determined to be necessary.
Cash and cash equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents include funds on hand, in bank and short-term investments with original maturities of ninety (90) days or less.
Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of the secured convertible debentures are presented
as restricted cash separate from cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying balance sheet.
Accounts Receivable:
Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a weekly basis. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer
receivables and considering a customer’s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions. Trade receivables are written off
when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received.
A trade receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than thirty (30) days beyond
terms. No interest is charged on overdue trade receivables.
F-12

Inventories:
Inventories consist of electronic parts, circuitry boards, camera parts and ancillary parts (collectively, “components”), work-in-process and
finished goods, and are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by standard cost methods, which approximate the first-in, first-
out method. Inventory costs include material, labor and manufacturing overhead. Service inventories that exceed the estimated requirements for
the next 12 months based on recent usage levels are reported as other long-term assets. Management has established inventory reserves based on
estimates of excess and/or obsolete current and non-current inventory.
Manufacturing inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis, based on estimated future use of
quantities on hand, which is determined based on past usage, planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology. Changes
in support plans or technology could have a significant impact on obsolescence.
To support our world-wide service operations, we maintain service spare parts inventory, which consists of both consumable and repairable
spare parts. Consumable service spare parts are used within our service business to replace worn or damaged parts in a system during a service
call and are generally classified in current inventory as our stock of this inventory turns relatively quickly. However, if there has been no recent
usage for a consumable service spare part, but the part is still necessary to support systems under service contracts, the part is considered to be
non-current and included within non-current inventories within our consolidated balance sheet. Consumables are charged to cost of goods sold
when issued during the service call.
As these service parts age over the related product group’s post-production service life, we reduce the net carrying value of our repairable
spare part inventory on the consolidated balance sheet to account for the excess that builds over the service life. The post-production service life of
our systems is generally seven to twelve years and, at the end of twelve years, the carrying value for these parts in our consolidated balance sheet
is reduced to zero. We also perform periodic monitoring of our installed base for premature end of service life events and expense, through cost of
sales, the remaining net carrying value of any related spare parts inventory in the period incurred.
Furniture, fixtures and equipment:
Furniture, fixtures and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Additions and improvements are capitalized while
ordinary maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is recorded by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from three to ten years. Amortization expense on capitalized leases is included with depreciation
expense. The cost and accumulated depreciation related to assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is credited or
charged to income.
Intangible assets:
Intangible assets include deferred patent costs and license agreements. Legal expenses incurred in preparation of patent application have
been deferred and will be amortized over the useful life of granted patents. Costs incurred in preparation of applications that are not granted will
be charged to expense at that time. The Company has entered into several sublicense agreements under which it has been assigned the exclusive
rights to certain licensed materials used in its products. These sublicense agreements generally require upfront payments to obtain the exclusive
rights to such material. The Company capitalizes the upfront payments as intangible assets and amortizes such costs over their estimated useful life
on a straight-line method.
Leases:
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For arrangements where the Company is the lessee, the Company
will evaluate whether to account for the lease as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are included in the right of use assets (ROU) and
operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. Finance leases would be included in furniture, fixtures and
equipment, net and long-term debt and finance lease obligations on the balance sheet. The Company had operating leases for copiers and its office
and warehouse space at December 31, 2019 but no financing leases.
F-13

ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at
commencement date. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in
determining the operating lease liabilities if the operating lease does not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include the option to extend
when Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
The Company elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not
recognized for short term leases.
Secured convertible debentures:
The Company has elected to record its debentures at fair value. Accordingly, the debentures are marked-to-market at each reporting date
with the change in fair value reported as a gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All issuance costs related to the debentures
were expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Proceeds investment agreement:
The Company has elected to record its proceeds investment agreement at its fair value. Accordingly, the proceeds investment agreement
will be marked-to-market at each reporting date with the change in fair value reported as a gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
All issuance costs related to the proceeds investment agreement were expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Senior Convertible Notes:
The Company has elected to record its senior convertible notes at its fair value. Accordingly, the senior convertible notes will be marked-to-
market at each reporting date with the change in fair value reported as a gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All issuance costs
related to the senior convertible notes were expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Long-Lived Assets:
Long-lived assets such as furniture, fixtures and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances
require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined
through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, as considered
necessary.
Warranties:
The Company’s products carry explicit product warranties that extend up to two years from the date of shipment. The Company records a
provision for estimated warranty costs based upon historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual
experience. Accrued warranty costs are included in accrued expenses. Extended warranties are offered on selected products and when a customer
purchases an extended warranty the associated proceeds are treated as contract liabilities and recognized over the term of the extended warranty.
Shipping and Handling Costs:
Shipping and handling costs for outbound sales orders totaled $65,312 and $66,053 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Such costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F-14

Advertising Costs:
Advertising expense includes costs related to trade shows and conventions, promotional material and supplies, and media costs. Advertising
costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The Company incurred total advertising expense of approximately $1,019,707 and
$384,113 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Such costs are included in selling, advertising and promotional expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Income Taxes:
Deferred taxes are provided for by the liability method in which deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are
the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
The Company applies the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No.
740 - Income Taxes that provides a framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and provided a comprehensive model to recognize,
measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. It initially
recognizes tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax
authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Application requires
numerous estimates based on available information. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax
benefits, and it recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. As it obtains additional information, the
Company may need to periodically adjust its recognized tax positions and tax benefits. These periodic adjustments may have a material impact on
its Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no interest expense related to the underpayment of estimated taxes during the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018. There were no penalties in 2019 and 2018.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various states. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s tax returns filed for
2016, 2017, and 2018 and to be filed for 2019 are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. With few exceptions, as of December
31, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to Federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.
Research and Development Expenses:
The Company expenses all research and development costs as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a
product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility
has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and software development costs
were expensed as incurred during 2019 and 2018.
Common Stock Purchase Warrants:
The Company has common stock purchase warrants that are accounted for as liabilities under the caption of derivative liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet and recorded at fair value due to the warrant agreements containing anti-dilution provisions. The change in fair value is
being recorded in Consolidated Statement of Operations.
F-15

The Company has common stock purchase warrants that are accounted for as equity based on their relative fair value and are not subject to
re-measurement.
Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees, board of directors and certain third-party contractors. Share-based
compensation arrangements may include the issuance of options to purchase common stock in the future or the issuance of restricted stock, which
generally are subject to vesting requirements. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation granted
based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of
the award.
The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Assumptions used
to estimate compensation expense are determined as follows:
● Expected term is determined using the contractual term and vesting period of the award;
● Expected volatility of award grants made in the Company’s plan is measured using the weighted average of historical daily changes
in the market price of the Company’s common stock over the period equal to the expected term of the award;
● Expected dividend rate is determined based on expected dividends to be declared;
● Risk-free interest rate is equivalent to the implied yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity equal to the expected
term of the awards; and
● Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.
Segments of Business:
The Company has determined that its operations are comprised of one reportable segment: the sale of digital audio and video recording and
speed detection devices. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, sales by geographic area were as follows:
Year ended December 31,
2019 2018
Sales by geographic area:
United States of America $ 10,251,259 $ 10,929,071
Foreign 190,105 362,338
$ 10,441,364 $ 11,291,409
Sales to customers outside of the United States are denominated in U.S. dollars. All Company assets are physically located within the United
States.
Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect
on the reported results of operations.
F-16

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”). The guidance requires lessees to put
most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting. Lessees initially
recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease
term. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is measured at the lease
liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee’s initial direct costs. The standard is effective for public
business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period, which is the
first quarter of 2019 for the Company.
The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019 using the optional transitional method and elected to use the package of three
practical expedients which allows the Company not to reassess whether contracts are or contain leases, lease classification and whether initial
direct costs qualify for capitalization. The Company has completed its assessment of the impact of the standard and determined that the only lease
that the Company held was an operating lease for its office and warehouse space. Upon adoption of the standard, the Company recorded Right of
Use (ROU) assets of approximately $501,000 and lease liabilities of approximately $582,000 related to it office and warehouse space operating
leases. The Company also removed deferred rent of approximately $81,000 when adopting the new guidance.
For financial liabilities measured using the fair value option in ASC 825, ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10):
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, issued in January 2016, requires entities to recognize the changes in
fair value of liabilities caused by a change in instrument specific credit risk (own credit risk) in other comprehensive income. The ASU is effective
for calendar-year public business entities beginning in 2018. For all other calendar-year entities, it is effective for annual periods beginning in 2019
and interim periods beginning in 2020. Entities can early adopt certain provisions of the new standard, including this provision related to financial
liabilities measured under the fair value option. We have considered this guidance and its impact on this debt accounted for at fair value. Based on
discussions with our valuation expert and knowledge of the Company there was no change in valuation caused by a change in the Company’s credit
risk during the period from August 5, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
ASU 2018-09, Codification improvements, clarifies the accounting for a debt extinguishment when the fair value option is elected. Upon
extinguishment an entity shall include in net income the cumulative amount of the gain or loss previously recorded in other comprehensive income
for the extinguished debt that resulted from changes in instrument-specific credit risk. The ASU is effective for calendar-year public business
entities beginning in 2019. For all other calendar-year entities, it is effective for annual periods beginning in 2020 and interim periods beginning in
2021. Early adoption is permitted for any fiscal year or interim period for which an entity’s financial statements have not yet been issued or have
not been made available to be issued. We have considered this guidance and its impact on this debt accounted for at fair value. Based on
discussions with our valuation expert and knowledge of the Company there was no change in valuation caused by a change in the Company’s credit
risk during the period from August 5, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Since there is no change accounted for as a change in Credit Risk (included in
other comprehensive income/loss) there is no impact to the Company’s financial statements from this new guidance.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” to improve information on credit losses for financial
assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss
impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. In April 2019 and May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04,
“Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial
Instruments” and ASU No. 2019-05, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief” which provided additional
implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments - Credit Loss
(Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842),” which defers the effective date for public filers that are considered
small reporting companies (“SRC”) as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Since the Company is an SRC, implementation is not needed until January 1, 2023. The
Company will continue to evaluate the effect of adopting ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
F-17

In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):
Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to improve the effectiveness of disclosures. The
amendments remove, modify, and add certain disclosure requirements in Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement.” The amendments on changes in
unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements,
and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period
presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective
date. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. Furthermore, an entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of the update and delay
adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU 2018-13 will
have on the disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangible-Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), or ASU 2018-15.
ASU 2018-15 updates guidance regarding accounting for implementation costs associated with a cloud computing arrangement that is a service
contract. The amendments under ASU 2018-15 are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes - simplifying the accounting for income taxes (Topic 740), which is meant to
simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740, Income Taxes. The amendment also
improves consistent application and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.
NOTE 2. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable. Sales to domestic
customers are typically made on credit and the Company generally does not require collateral while sales to international customers require
payment before shipment or backing by an irrevocable letter or credit. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition and maintains an allowance for estimated losses. Accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible and accounts receivable are
presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $123,224 as of December 31, 2019 and $70,000
as of December 31, 2018.
The Company uses primarily a network of unaffiliated distributors for international sales and employee-based direct sales force for domestic
sales. No international distributor individually exceeded 10% of total revenues and no customer receivable balance exceeded 10% of total accounts
receivable for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company purchases finished circuit boards and other proprietary component parts from suppliers located in the United States and on a
limited basis from Asia. Although the Company obtains certain of these components from single source suppliers, it generally owns all tooling and
management has located alternative suppliers to reduce the risk in most cases to supplier problems that could result in significant production
delays. The Company has not historically experienced significant supply disruptions from any of its principal vendors and does not anticipate future
supply disruptions. The Company acquires most of its components on a purchase order basis and does not have long-term contracts with its
suppliers.

2019 Secured Convertible Notes.
On August 5, 2019, the Company, entered into a securities purchase agreement with several accredited investors providing for the issuance
of (i) the Company’s 8% secured convertible notes due August 4, 2020 with a principal face amount of $2,777,777.78, which convertible notes are,
subject to certain conditions, convertible into 1,984,126 shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price per share of $1.40; (ii) five-year
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 571,428 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.8125, which warrants are immediately
exercisable upon issuance and on a cashless basis if the Warrants have not been registered 180 days after the date of issuance; and (iii) the
issuance of shares of common stock equal to 5% of the aggregate purchase price of the convertible notes, with an aggregate value of $125,000 (the
“Commitment Shares”). The accredited investors purchased the foregoing securities for an aggregate cash purchase price of $2,500,000.
F-20

Pursuant to the purchase agreement, an aggregate of $1,153,320 in principal amount of convertible notes (the “Registered Notes”), the
conversion shares underlying the Registered Notes and all of the Commitment Shares were issued to the accredited investors in a registered direct
offering pursuant to a prospectus supplement to the Company’s currently effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Accordingly,
$1,153,320 in original principal amount of our convertible notes were issued as Registered Notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement and
therefore freely tradable.
In a related transaction and in accordance with the purchase agreement, the Company issued to the accredited investors in a concurrent
private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, (1) the remaining aggregate of $1,624,457.78 in principal amount of convertible notes, (2) the
shares of common stock issuable from time to time upon conversion of such convertible notes, and (3) the common shares underlying the common
stock purchase warrants. On September 5, 2019, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 covering the securities issued in the
concurrent private placement including an aggregate of $1,624,457.78 in principal amount of previously non-registered convertible notes, the
shares of common stock issuable from time to time upon conversion of such non-registered convertible notes and the common stock underlying the
common stock purchase warrants. Such Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
September 12, 2019.
In connection with the purchase agreement, the Company and its subsidiary entered into a security agreement, dated as of August 5, 2019,
with the investors, pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiary granted a security interest in, among other items, the Company and its
subsidiary’s accounts, chattel paper, documents, equipment, general intangibles, instruments and inventory, and all proceeds, as set forth in the
security agreement. In addition, pursuant to an intellectual property security agreement, dated as of August 5, 2019, the Company granted a
continuing security interest in all of the Company’s right, title and interest in, to and under certain of the Company’s trademarks, copyrights and
patents. In addition, the Company’s subsidiary jointly and severally agreed to guarantee and act as surety for the Company’s obligation to repay the
convertible notes pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee.
Under the purchase agreement, the convertible notes and warrants contain provisions whereby the accredited investors are prohibited from
exercising their rights to convert the notes or exercise the warrants if, as a result of such conversion or exercise, such holder, together with its
affiliates, would own more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to
such exercise. However, the investors may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, provided that any
increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after such notice to the Company.
The Company elected to account for the secured convertible notes on the fair value basis. Therefore, the Company determined the fair value
of the (1) secured convertible notes, (2) the Commitment Shares and (3) the common stock purchase warrants which yielded estimated fair values
of the secured convertible notes including their embedded derivatives, the Commitment Shares and the detachable common stock purchase
warrants. The following represents the resulting fair value as determined on August 5, 2019, the date of origination:
Secured convertible notes $ 1,845,512
Common stock issued as Commitment Shares 118,749
Common stock purchase warrants 535,739
Gross cash proceeds $ 2,500,000
F-21

Under the fair value basis, the Company determines the fair value of the secured convertible notes and adjusts the carrying value of the
secured convertible notes at each reporting date with the resulting charge or credit being reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.
Following is an analysis of the activity in the secured convertible notes during the year ended December 31, 2019:
Amount
Balance at December 31, 2018 $ —
Issuance of convertible notes on August 5, 2019, at fair value 1,845,512
Principal repaid during the period by issuance of common stock (648,067)
Principal repaid during the period by payment of cash (123,457)
Change in fair value of secured convertible note during the period 519,821
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,593,809
Following is a range of certain estimates and assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2019 and August 5. 2019 (inception date) to
determine the fair value of secured convertible notes:
December 31, 2019 August 5, 2019
Assumptions Assumptions
Volatility – range 115% 110%
Risk-free rate 1.60% 1.78%
Contractual term 0.6 years 0.9 years
Calibrated stock price $ 1.06 $ 0.86
Debt yield 123.6% 88.6%
Under the fair value basis, legal, accounting and miscellaneous costs directly related to the issuance of the secured convertible notes are
charged to expense as incurred. A total of $89,148 of such issuance costs were charged to operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.
2018 Proceeds Investment Agreement.
On July 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Proceeds Investment Agreement (the “PIA Agreement”) with Brickell Key Investments LP
(“BKI”), pursuant to which BKI funded an aggregate of $500,000 (the “First Tranche”) to be used (i) to fund the Company’s litigation proceedings
relating to the infringement of certain patent assets listed in the PIA Agreement and (ii) to repay the Company’s existing debt obligations and for
certain working capital purposes set forth in the PIA Agreement. Pursuant to the PIA Agreement, BKI was granted an option to provide the
Company with an additional $9.5 million, at BKI’s sole discretion (the “Second Tranche”). On August 21, 2018, BKI exercised its option on the
Second Tranche for $9.5 million which completed the $10 million funding.
Pursuant to the PIA Agreement and in consideration for the $10 million in funding, the Company agreed to assign to BKI (i) 100% of all
gross, pre-tax monetary recoveries paid by any defendant(s) to the Company or its affiliates agreed to in a settlement or awarded in judgment in
connection with the patent assets, plus any interest paid in connection therewith by such defendant(s) (the “Patent Assets Proceeds”), up to the
minimum return (as defined in the Agreement) and (ii) if BKI has not received its minimum return by the earlier of a liquidity event (as defined in
the Agreement) and July 31, 2020, then the Company agreed to assign to BKI 100% of the Patent Asset Proceeds until BKI has received an amount
equal to the minimum return on $4.0 million.
Pursuant to the PIA Agreement, the Company granted BKI (i) a senior security interest in the Patent Assets, the claims (as defined in the
Agreement) and the Patent Assets Proceeds until such time as the minimum return is paid, in which case, the security interest on the patent assets,
the claims and the Patent Assets Proceeds will be released, and (ii) a senior security interest in all other assets of the Company until such time as
the minimum return is paid on $4.0 million, in which case, the security interest on such other assets will be released.
The security interest is enforceable by BKI if the Company is in default under the PIA Agreement which would occur if (i) the Company fails,
after five (5) days’ written notice, to pay any due amount payable to BKI under the PIA Agreement, (ii) the Company fails to comply with any
provision of the PIA Agreement or any other agreement or document contemplated under the PIA Agreement, (iii) the Company becomes insolvent
or insolvency proceedings are commenced (and not subsequently discharged) with respect to the Company, (iv) the Company’s creditors commence
actions against the Company (which are not subsequently discharged) that affect material assets of the Company, (v) the Company, without BKI’s
consent, incurs indebtedness other than immaterial ordinary course indebtedness up to $500,000, (vi) the Company fails, within five (5) business
days following the closing of the second tranche, to fully satisfy its obligations to certain holders of the Company’s senior secured convertible
promissory notes listed in the PIA Agreement and fails to obtain unconditional releases from such holders as to the Company’s obligations to such
holders and the security interests in the Company held by such holders or (vii) there is an uncured non-compliance of the Company’s obligations or
misrepresentations by the Company under the PIA Agreement.
F-22

Under the PIA Agreement, the Company issued BKI a warrant to purchase up to 465,712 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the “PIA Warrant”), at an exercise price of $2.60 per share provided that the holder of the PIA Warrant will be prohibited from
exercising the PIA Warrant if, as a result of such exercise, such holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 4.99% of the total number
of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. However, such holder may increase or
decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until
61 days after such notice to the Company. The PIA Warrant is exercisable for five years from the date of issuance and is exercisable on a cashless
exercise basis if there is no effective registration statement. No contractual registration rights were given.
The Company elected to account for the PIA on the fair value basis. Therefore, the Company determined the fair value of the PIA and PIA
Warrants which yielded estimated fair values of the PIA including their embedded derivatives and the detachable PIA Warrants as follows:
Proceeds investment agreement $ 9,067,513
Common stock purchase warrants 932,487
Gross cash proceeds $ 10,000,000
The Company utilized a probability weighted present value of expected patent asset proceeds for the litigation involving both Axon and
WatchGuard (see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies) which involved estimates of the amount and timing of the expected patent asset
proceeds from the alleged patent infringement. The fair value of the PIA is updated for actual and estimated activity affecting the probability
weighted present value of expected patent asset proceeds at each reporting date with the change charged/credited to operations. Following is a
range of certain estimates and assumptions utilized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 to probability weighted present value of expected patent
asset proceeds for the litigation involving both Axon and WatchGuard:
December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018
Discount rate 3.0% - 16.6% 4.7% - 21.75%
Expected term to patent asset proceeds payment 0.58 years - 4 years 0.93 years - 1.1 years
Probability of success 5.9% - 38.5% 17.7% - 77.0%
Estimated minimum return payable to BKI $ 21 million $ 22.5 million
Negotiation discount 43.3% 54.4%
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company settled its patent infringement litigation with WatchGuard whereby it received a
lump-sum payment of $6.0 million as further described in Note 12. In accordance with the terms of the PIA, the Company remitted the $6.0 as a
principal payment toward its minimum return payment obligations under the PIA. The Company recorded the receipt of the $6,000,000 settlement
as Patent litigation settlement income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.
The following represents activity in the PIA during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Beginning balance as of January 1, 2018 $ -
Origination date at fair value of the Debentures 9,067,513
Change in the fair value during the period 74,487
Ending balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 9,142,000
Beginning balance as of January 1, 2019 $ 9.142,000
Repayment of obligation (6,000,000)
Change in the fair value during the period 3,358,000
Ending balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 6,500,000
Unsecured Promissory Note Payable.
On December 23, 2019, the Company, borrowed $300,000 under an unsecured note payable to a private, third-party lender. The promissory
note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum with principal and accrued interest payable on or before its maturity date of March 31, 2020. The
Company granted the lender warrants exercisable to purchase a total of 107,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $1.40 per share
until December 23, 2024. The Company allocated $71,869 of the proceeds of the promissory note to additional paid-in-capital, which represented
the grant date relative fair value of the warrants issued to the lender. The discount will be amortized to interest expense ratably over the term of
the promissory note which approximates the effective interest method. The amortization of discount resulted in $5,808 of the discount amortized to
interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2019.

2018 Secured Convertible Debentures.
On April 3, 2018, and May 11, 2018, the Company completed a private placement (the “2018 Private Placement”) of $6.875 million in
principal amount of senior secured convertible promissory notes (the “2018 Debentures”) and warrants to purchase 916,667 shares of common
stock of the Company (the “2018 Warrants”) to institutional investors. The 2018 Debentures and 2018 Warrants were issued pursuant to a
securities purchase agreement between the Company and the purchasers’ signatory thereto. Additionally, a portion of the 2018 Debentures and
2018 Warrants were issued to two institutional investors pursuant to their respective participation rights under a securities purchase agreement,
dated August 21, 2017. One of the institutional investors that participated in the 2017 common stock issuance closed its tranche with the Company
on May 11, 2018. The 2018 Private Placement resulted in gross cash proceeds of $6.25 million ($6.875 million par value) before placement agent
fees and other expenses associated with the transaction. The proceeds were used primarily for full repayment of the 2016 Debentures described
above, other outstanding subordinated debt of the Company, working capital and general corporate purposes.
The Company elected to account for the 2018 Debentures on the fair value basis. Therefore, the Company determined the fair value of the
2018 Debentures and 2018 Warrants which yielded estimated fair values of the 2018 Debentures including their embedded derivatives and the
detachable 2018 Warrants as follows:
Secured convertible debentures $ 4,565,749
Common stock purchase warrants 1,684,251
Gross cash proceeds $ 6,250,000
The Company paid the remaining balances of the 2018 Debentures on August 21, 2018 from proceeds of the 2018 proceeds investment
agreement described below. The change in fair value of the 2018 Debentures was $2,309,251 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following represents activity in the 2018 Debentures during the year ended December 31, 2018:
Beginning balance as of January 1, 2018 $ -
Origination date at fair value of the Debentures 4,565,749

On December 30, 2016, the Company completed a private placement (the “2016 Private Placement”) of $4.0 million in principal amount of
the secured convertible debentures (the “2016 Debentures”) and common stock warrants (the “2016 Warrants”) to two institutional investors. The
2016 Debentures and 2016 Warrants were issued pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and the purchasers’
signatory thereto. The 2016 Private Placement resulted in gross proceeds of $4.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses
associated with the transaction totaling $281,570, which was expensed as incurred.
The Company elected to account for the 2016 Debentures on the fair value basis. Therefore, the Company determined the fair value of the
2016 Debentures utilizing Monte Carlo simulation models which yielded an estimated fair value of $4.0 million for the Debentures including their
embedded derivatives as of the origination date. No value was allocated to the detachable 2016 Warrants as of the origination date because of the
relative fair value of the 2016 Debentures including their embedded derivative features approximated the gross proceeds of the financing
transaction. The Company made principal payments of $750,000 on August 24, 2017 on the 2016 Debentures.
The Company paid the remaining balance of the 2016 Debentures on April 3, 2018 from proceeds of the 2018 secured convertible
debentures described below. The Company recorded debt extinguishment costs of $600,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to
the repayment and extinguishment of the 2016 Debentures.
The change in fair value of the 2016 Debentures was $-0- and $(12,807) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Unsecured Promissory Notes Payable.
On September 29, 2017, the Company borrowed $300,000 under an unsecured note payable with a private, third party lender. Such note
bore interest at 8% per annum and was due and payable in full on November 30, 2017. The note was unsecured and subordinated to all existing
and future senior indebtedness, as such term was defined in the note. The Company issued warrants to the lender exercisable to purchase 100,000
shares of common stock for $2.75 per share until September 30, 2022. The Company allocated $117,000 of the proceeds of the note to additional
paid-in-capital, which represented the grant date relative fair value of the warrants issued to the lender. The discount was amortized to interest
expense ratably over the terms of the note. On December 29, 2017 the Company borrowed an additional $350,000 with the same private, third
party lender and combined the existing note payable plus accrued interest into a new note (the “Secured Note”) for $658,500 that was due and
payable in full on March 1, 2018 and could be prepaid without penalty. The Secured Note was secured by the Company’s intellectual property
portfolio, as such term is defined in the security agreement relating to the Secured Note. In connection with issuance of the Secured Note, the
Company issued warrants to the lender exercisable to purchase 120,000 shares of common stock for $3.25 per share until December 28, 2022. The
Company treated the issuance and extension of this debt as an extinguishment for financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the estimated fair
value of the warrants granted totaled $244,379, which was recorded as additional paid-in-capital and a loss on extinguishment of subordinated
notes payable.
The Company paid the remaining balances of the Secured Note and subordinated note with an aggregate principal balance of $1,008,500 on
April 3, 2018.
On March 7, 2018 the Company borrowed $250,000 under a secured note payable with a private, third party lender (the “March Note”). The
March Note bears interest at 12% per annum and contained an original maturity date of June 7, 2018. The Company negotiated an extension of the
maturity date to September 30, 2018. The March Note was secured by the inventory of the Company and junior to senior liens held by the holders
of the 2018 Debentures and subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as such term was defined in the March Note. Such Note
was convertible at any time after its date of issue at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of
$3.25 per share. The conversion price and exercise price were subject to adjustment upon stock splits, reverse stock splits, and similar capital
changes. The Company issued warrants to the lender exercisable to purchase 36,000 shares of common stock for $3.50 per share until March 7,
2019. The Company allocated $15,287 of the proceeds of the note to additional paid-in-capital, which represented the grant date relative fair value
of the warrants issued to the lender. The discount was amortized to interest expense ratably over the terms of the note. The Company made a
principal payment of $100,000 on August 21, 2018 on the March Note. The holder converted the remaining principal and outstanding interest of
the March Note into 47,319 shares of the Company’s common stock on September 20, 2018.
The discount amortized to interest expense totaled $-0- and $47,657 for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
NOTE 8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
In accordance with ASC Topic 820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), the Company utilizes the market approach to
measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.
ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
The following is a brief description of those three levels:
● Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
● Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities)
● Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value)

The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets totaled $23,740,000 and $21,500,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
Company records the benefit it will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences as
“deferred tax assets.” In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our
deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act, which is also commonly referred to as “U.S. tax
reform,” significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting
in 2018. Under the Act, corporations are no longer subject to the AMT, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. However,
where a corporation has an AMT Credit from a prior taxable year, the corporation still carries it forward and may use a portion of it as a refundable
credit in any taxable year beginning after 2017 but before 2022. Generally, 50% of the corporation’s AMT Credit carried forward to one of these
years starting in 2018 will be claimable and refundable for that year. In tax years beginning in 2021, however, the entire remaining carryforward
generally will be refundable.
The Company has incurred operating losses in 2019 and 2018 and it continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position at December
31, 2019 and 2018. Accordingly, the Company determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding its potential for future profits to
outweigh the negative evidence of our three-year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in ASC 740. Therefore, it determined to
increase our valuation allowance by $2,240,000 to continue to fully reserve its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. The Company expects to
continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until it determines that it can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates its ability to realize
these assets. To the extent the Company determines that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected
future taxable income, a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed. Such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and,
for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises, an increase in shareholders’ equity.
F-28

At December 31, 2019, the Company had available approximately $67,100,000 of Federal net operating loss carryforwards available to
offset future taxable income generated. Such tax net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2026 and 2039. In addition, the Company had
research and development tax credit carryforwards totaling $1,795,000 available as of December 31, 2019, which expire between 2023 and 2037.
The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards
in the event that it has experienced a more than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Current estimates prepared by the Company
indicate that due to ownership changes which have occurred, approximately $765,000 of its net operating loss and $175,000 of its research and
development tax credit carryforwards are currently subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1,151,000, but may be further limited by
additional ownership changes which may occur in the future. As stated above, the net operating loss and research and development credit
carryforwards expire between 2023 and 2038, allowing the Company to potentially utilize all of the limited net operating loss carry-forwards during
the carryforward period.
As discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first
determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured
as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management has identified no tax
positions taken that would meet or exceed these thresholds and therefore there are no gross interest, penalties and unrecognized tax
expense/benefits that are not expected to ultimately result in payment or receipt of cash in the consolidated financial statements.
The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 varied from the expected statutory rate due to the Company
continuing to provide a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. The Company determined that it was appropriate to continue the full
valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 primarily because of the current year operating losses.
The Company’s federal and state income tax returns are closed for examination purposes by relevant statute and by examination for 2015
and all prior tax years.
NOTE 11. OPERATING LEASE
The Company entered into an operating lease with a third party in September 2012 for office and warehouse space in Lenexa, Kansas. The
terms of the lease include monthly payments ranging from $38,026 to $38,533 with a maturity date of April 2020. The Company has the option to
renew for an additional three years beyond the original expiration date, which may be exercised at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company
evaluated the renewal option at the lease commencement date to determine if it is reasonably certain the exercise the option and concluded that it
is not reasonably certain that any options will be exercised. The weighted average remaining lease term for the Company’s office and warehouse
operating lease as of December 31, 2019 was four months.
The Company entered into an operating lease with a third party in October 2019 for copiers used for office and warehouse purposes. The terms
of the lease include 48 monthly payments of $1,598 with a maturity date of October 2023. The Company has the option to Purchase the equipment
at maturity for its estimated fair market value at that point in time. The remaining lease term for the Company’s copier operating lease as of
December 31, 2019 was 46 months.
Lease expense related to the office space and copier operating leases were recorded on a straight-line basis over their respective lease terms.
Total lease expense under the two operating leases was approximately $400,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The discount rate implicit within the Company’s operating leases was not generally determinable and therefore the Company determined the
discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate on the information available at commencement date. As of commencement date, the
operating lease liabilities reflect a weighted average discount rate of 8%.
The cash outflows from operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $400,920. The weighted average remaining lease term and
the weighted average discount rate for operating leases at December 31, 2019 were 5.6 months and 8%, respectively.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
License agreements. The Company has several license agreements under which it has been assigned the rights to certain licensed
materials used in its products. Certain of these agreements require the Company to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped
containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis. Royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated $0 and $2,083 for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Litigation.
From time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not
disclose the specifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the
claim, and assuming we determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit
filed against us. We record a liability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but
not probable, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if
material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical
experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of
insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time.
F-30

While the ultimate resolution is unknown, based on the information currently available, we do not expect that these lawsuits will
individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the
outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result
from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance
coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.
Axon
The Company owns U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the “ ‘452 Patent”), which generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of
multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event, such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle.
The Company filed suit on January 15, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas (Case No: 2:16-cv-02032) against Axon,
alleging willful patent infringement against Axon’s body camera product line and Signal auto-activation product. The Company is seeking both
monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Axon for infringement of the ‘452 Patent.
In December 2016 and January 2017, Axon filed two petitions for Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) against the ‘452 Patent. The United States
Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) rejected both of Axon’s petitions. Axon is now statutorily precluded from filing any more IPR petitions
against the ‘452 Patent.
The District Court litigation in Kansas was temporarily stayed following the filing of the petitions for IPR. However, on November 17, 2017,
the Federal District Court of Kansas rejected Axon’s request to maintain the stay. With this significant ruling, the parties will now proceed towards
trial. Since litigation has resumed, the Court has issued a claim construction order (also called a Markman Order) where it sided with the Company
on all disputes and denied Axon’s attempts to limit the scope of the claims. Following the Markman Order, the Court set all remaining deadlines in
the case. Fact discovery closed on October 8, 2018, and a Final Pretrial Conference took place on January 16, 2019. The parties filed motions for
summary judgment on January 31, 2019.
On June 17, 2019, the Court granted Axon’s motion for summary judgment that Axon did not infringe on the Company’s patent and dismissed
the case. Importantly, the Court’s ruling did not find that Digital’s ‘452 Patent was invalid. It also did not address any other issue, such as whether
Digital’s requested damages were appropriate, and it did not impact the Company’s ability to file additional lawsuits to hold other competitors
accountable for patent infringement. This ruling solely related to an interpretation of the claims as they relate to Axon and was unrelated to the
supplemental briefing Digital recently filed on its damages claim and the WatchGuard settlement. Those issues are separate and the judge’s ruling
on summary judgment had nothing to do with Digital’s damages request. The Company has filed an appeal to this ruling and has asked the
appellate court to reverse this decision.
The Company filed its Opening Appeal Brief on August 26, 2019 and Axon filed its Responsive Brief on November 6, 2019 and the Company
filed its Reply Brief responding to Axon on November 27, 2019. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit scheduled oral argument
on the Company’s appeal of the district court’s summary judgment order on April 6, 2020. This appeal will address the incorrect and mistaken
dismissal of Digital Ally’s claims against Axon by Judge Carlos Murguia in the U.S. District Court of Kansas litigation. If the Court of Appeals
overturns the summary judgment ruling, a new judge will be assigned to handle the litigation with Axon due to the recent resignation of Judge
Murguia. On March 12, 2020, the panel of judges for the United States Court of Appeals issued an order cancelling the oral arguments previously
set for April 6, 2020 having determined that they will decide the appeal based on the parties’ briefs without oral argument.
WatchGuard
On May 27, 2016, the Company filed suit against WatchGuard, (Case No. 2:16-cv-02349-JTM-JPO) alleging patent infringement based on
WatchGuard’s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines.
On May 13, 2019, the parties resolved the dispute and executed a settlement agreement in the form of a Release and License Agreement. The
litigation has been dismissed as a result of this settlement.
F-31

The Release and License Agreement encompasses the following key terms:
● WatchGuard paid Digital Ally a one-time, lump settlement payment of $6,000,000.
● Digital Ally granted WatchGuard a perpetual covenant not to sue if WatchGuard’s products incorporate agreed-upon modified recording
functionality. Digital Ally also granted WatchGuard a license to the ‘292 Patent and the ‘452 Patent (and related patents, now existing and
yet-to-issue) through December 31, 2023. The parties agreed to negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve any alleged infringement that
occurs after the license period expires.
● The parties further agreed to release each other from all claims or liabilities pre-existing the settlement.
● As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that WatchGuard made no admission that it infringed any of Digital Ally’s patents.
Upon receipt of the $6,000,000 the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit which the Judge granted.
PGA Tour, Inc.
On January 22, 2019 the PGA Tour, Inc. (the “PGA”) filed suit against the Company in the Federal District Court for the District of Kansas
(Case No. 2:19-cv-0033-CM-KGG) alleging breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing relative to the Web.com
Tour Title Sponsor Agreement (the “Agreement”). The contract was executed on April 16, 2015 by and between the parties. Under the Agreement,
Digital Ally would be a title sponsor of and receive certain naming and other rights and benefits associated with the Web.com Tour for 2015
through 2019 in exchange for Digital Ally’s payment to Tour of annual sponsorship fees. The suit was resolved and the case has been dismissed by
Plaintiff with prejudice on April 17, 2019.
401 (k) Plan. The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan, as amended, requires it to
provide 100% matching contributions for employees, who elect to contribute up to 3% of their compensation to the plan and 50% matching
contributions for employee’s elective deferrals on the next 2% of their contributions. The Company made matching contributions totaling $108,688
and $112,622 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Each participant is 100% vested at all times in employee and
employer matching contributions.
Consulting and Distributor Agreements. The Company entered into an agreement that required it to make monthly payments that will
be applied to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider. The agreement is with a limited liability company (“LLC”)
that is minority owned by a relative of the Company’s chief financial officer. Under the agreement, dated January 15, 2016 and as amended on
February 13, 2017, the LLC provides consulting services for developing a new distribution channel outside of law enforcement for its body-worn
camera and related cloud storage products to customers in the United States. The Company advanced amounts to the LLC against commissions
ranging from $5,000 to $6,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for the period through June 30, 2017, which can be
automatically extended based on the LLC achieving minimum sales quotas. The agreement was renewed in January 2017 for a period of three
years, subject to yearly minimum sales thresholds that would allow the Company to terminate the contract if such minimums are not met. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company had advanced a total of $274,731 pursuant to this agreement and established an allowance reserve of $224,731
for a net advance of $50,000. The minimum sales threshold was not met, and the Company discontinued all advances, although the contract has not
been formally terminated. However, the exclusivity provisions of the agreement have been terminated.
F-32

On June 1, 2018 the Company entered into an agreement with an individual that required it to make monthly payments that will be applied
to future commissions and/or consulting fees to be earned by the provider. Under the agreement, the individual provides consulting services for
developing new distribution channels both inside and outside of law enforcement for its in-car and body-worn camera systems and related cloud
storage products to customers within and outside the United States. The Company was required to advance amounts to the individual as an
advance against commissions of $7,000 per month plus necessary and reasonable expenses for the period through August 31, 2018, which was
extended to December 31, 2018 by mutual agreement of the parties at $6,000 per month. The parties have mutually agreed to further extend the
arrangement on a monthly basis at $5,000 per month. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had advanced a total of $53,332 pursuant to this
agreement.
NOTE 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company recorded pretax compensation expense related to the grant of stock options and restricted stock issued of $2,112,090 and
$2,272,656 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had adopted seven separate stock option and restricted stock plans: (i) the 2005 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan (the “2005 Plan”), (ii) the 2006 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), (iii) the 2007 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan (the “2007 Plan”), (iv) the 2008 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2008 Plan”), (v) the 2011 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan (the “2011 Plan”), (vi) the 2013 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2013 Plan”), (vii) the 2015 Stock Option and
Restricted Stock Plan (the “2015 Plan”) and (vii) the 2018 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2005 Plan, 2006 Plan,
2007 Plan, 2008 Plan, 2011 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2015 Plan and 2018 Plan are referred to as the “Plans.”
These Plans permit the grant of stock options or restricted stock to its employees, non-employee directors and others for up to a total of
4,175,000 shares of common stock. The 2005 Plan terminated during 2015 with 19,678 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are
now unavailable for issuance. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 total
8,063. The 2006 Plan terminated during 2016 with 24,662 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for
issuance. Stock options granted under the 2006 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 total 42,812. The 2007
Plan terminated during 2017 with 88,401 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. Stock options
granted under the 2007 Plan that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 total 6,250. The 2008 Plan terminated during 2018
with 8,249 shares not awarded or underlying options, which shares are now unavailable for issuance. Stock options granted under the 2008 Plan
that remain unexercised and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 total 32,250.
The Company believes that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of its stockholders. Option awards have been
granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of its stock at the date of grant with such option awards generally vesting based on the
completion of continuous service and having ten-year contractual terms. These option awards typically provide for accelerated vesting if there is a
change in control (as defined in the Plans). The Company has registered all shares of common stock that are issuable under its Plans with the SEC.
A total of 629,186 shares remained available for awards under the various Plans as of December 31, 2019.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
Activity in the various Plans during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is reflected in the following table:

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The total estimated
grant date fair value stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $436,217 and $284,384, respectively.
The Company has utilized the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the estimated grant date fair
value of the options during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:.
2019 2018

Risk-free rate 2.23% 2.74%
Contractual term 5.5 years 5.5 years
Exercise price $ 3.01 $ 2.20
The Plans allow for the cashless exercise of stock options. This provision allows the option holder to surrender/cancel options with an
intrinsic value equivalent to the purchase/exercise price of other options exercised. There were no shares surrendered pursuant to cashless
exercises during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was approximately $-0- and $76,800, respectively, and
the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable was approximately $-0- and $76,800, respectively. No options were exercised in the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018.
As of December 31, 2019, the unrecognized portion of stock compensation expense on all existing stock options was $181,757 and will be
recognized over the next five months.

Restricted stock grants. The Board of Directors has granted restricted stock awards under the Plans. Restricted stock awards are valued
on the date of grant and have no purchase price for the recipient. Restricted stock awards typically vest over one to four years corresponding to
anniversaries of the grant date. Under the Plans, unvested shares of restricted stock awards may be forfeited upon the termination of service to or
employment with the Company, depending upon the circumstances of termination. Except for restrictions placed on the transferability of restricted
stock, holders of unvested restricted stock have full stockholder’s rights, including voting rights and the right to receive cash dividends.

NOTE 14. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
The Company has issued common stock purchase warrants in conjunction with various debt and equity issuances. The warrants are either
immediately exercisable, or have a delayed initial exercise date, no more than six months from their respective issue date and allow the holders to
purchase up to 4,824,573 shares of common stock at $1.40 to $16.50 per share as of December 31, 2019. The warrants expire from July 15, 2020
through December 23, 2024 and allow for cashless exercise.
Certain common stock purchase warrants issued in August 2014 contained anti-dilution provisions that triggered a reset as a result of the
April 2018 financing transaction. The reset provisions resulted in the 12,200 warrants held at an exercise price of $7.32 per share increased by
159,538 warrants resulting in a final reset to 172,038 warrants at an exercise price of $0.52 per share. All warrants subject to the reset provision
have now been exercised.

NOTE 15. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Underwritten Public Offering - On September 26, 2018, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Roth Capital
Partners, LLC, as the representative of the underwriters and sole book-running manager, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the
underwriters in a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) an aggregate of 2,400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share at a public price of $3.05 per share. The Company also granted the Underwriters a forty-five (45)-day option to purchase
up to an additional 360,000 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. Aegis Capital Corp. was a co-manager for the Offering. The
Offering was registered and the common stock was issued pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.
333-225227), which was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 25, 2018 and was declared effective on June 6, 2018.
On September 28, 2018, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option to acquire an additional 200,000 shares at $3.05 per share. The
partial exercise of the over-allotment option resulted in additional gross proceeds of $610,000. The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering
totaled approximately $7,324,900 including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses payable by the Company.
Under the underwriting agreement the Company agreed not to contract to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of any
Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for sixty (60) days following the closing of the Offering, subject to certain exclusions as set forth
therein. The Company’s executive officers and directors have entered into sixty (60)-day Lock-Up Agreements with the Representative pursuant to
which they have agreed not to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by them, subject to
certain exclusions as set forth therein.
Approval of the 2018 Stock Option Plan and Restricted Stock Plan - On July 5, 2018 at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company’s
stockholders approved the 2018 Digital Ally, Inc. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan and reserving 1,000,000 shares for issuance under such
Plan.
NOTE 16. NET LOSS PER SHARE
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and loss per share outstanding for the years ended December 31,
2019 and 2018 are as follows:
Year ended December 31,
2019 2018
Numerator for basic and diluted income per share – Net loss $ (10,005,713) $ (15,544,551)
Denominator for basic loss per share – weighted average shares
outstanding 11,478,618 8,073,257
Dilutive effect of shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt and
the exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding — —
Denominator for diluted loss per share – adjusted weighted average shares
outstanding 11,478,618 8,073,257
Net loss per share:
Basic $ (0.87) $ (1.93)
Diluted $ (0.87) $ (1.93)
F-37

Basic loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, all shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants
were antidilutive, and, therefore, not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share.
Note 17 - Subsequent events
2020 Issuance of Restricted Common Stock.- On January 3, 2020, the board of directors approved the grant of 530,050 restricted
common shares to officers and employees of the Company. Such shares will generally vest one-half on January 2, 2021 and one half on January 2,
2022, provided that each grantee remains an officer or employee on such dates.
2019 Secured Convertible Notes.- Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the holders of the 2019 Convertible Notes exercised their right to
convert principal balances aggregating $1,259,074 into equity. In addition, the Company exercised their right to prepay in cash the remaining
outstanding principal balance aggregating $574,341. Their remain no outstanding 2019 Convertible notes as a result of these conversions and
prepayments.
Underwritten public offering - On March 3, 2020, the Company consummated an underwritten public offering of 2,521,740 shares of
common stock (the Offering”). The Offering was conducted pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated February 27, between the Company and
Aegis Capital Corp. (the “Underwriters”). The common stock in the Offering was sold at a public offering price of $1.15 per share. The Company
has granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 378,261 additional shares of common stock at the public offering
price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any.
The common stock in the Offering was issued pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-
225227). The underwriting agreement contained customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to
closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the Underwriters. The Underwriters received discounts and commissions of seven percent
(7%) of the gross cash proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the common shares in the Offering. In addition, the Company agreed to
pay the Underwriters (a) a non-accountable expense reimbursement of 1% of the gross proceeds received and (b) “road show” expenses, diligence
fees and the fees and expenses of the Underwriters’ legal counsel not to exceed $50,000.
Under the underwriting agreement, the Company and its officers and directors executed lock-up agreements whereby, (a) the Company has
agreed not to engage in the following for a period of 45 days from the date of the pricing of the Offering, (1) offer, sell or otherwise transfer or
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of capital stock of the Company, or (2) file or caused to be filed any registration statement with the SEC
relating to the offering of any shares of the Company’s capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of
the Company’s capital stock, and (b) the Company’s executive officers and directors, as of the pricing date of the Offering, have agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, not to offer, issue, sell, contract to sell, encumber, grant any option for the sale of or otherwise dispose of any securities of the
Company without the prior written consent of the Underwriters, for a period of 45 days from the date of the offering.
The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated
offering expenses, and assuming the Underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase the option shares, are approximately $2.9 million. The
net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the non-accountable expense
reimbursement, but before deducting other expenses in connection with the offering, and assuming the Underwriters do not exercise their option to
purchase the option Shares, are approximately $2.67 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund the
repayment of debt and for general corporate purposes.
F-38

Debt Financing:- The Company entered two debt instruments subsequent to December 31, 2019 as follows:
● During February 2020, the Company borrowed a total of $289,000 from the Company’s Chairman, CEO & President under an unsecured
promissory note bearing interest at 6% through its May 28, 2020 maturity date. The proceeds from the note were used for general corporate
purposes.
● On January 17, 2020, the Company borrowed a total of $100,000 from an individual under an unsecured promissory note bearing interest at
8% through its April 17, 2020 maturity date. In connection with the loan, the Company issued the individual a warrant for the purchase of
35,750 shares of common stock at $1.40 per share for a period of five years from the date of the note. The proceeds from the note were used
for general corporate purposes.
NASDAQ Listing - Our Common Stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In order to maintain that listing, we
must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and
independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There
can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.
If our Common Stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our Common Stock
could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or
the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our Common Stock, and
there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional
capital if we are not listed on Nasdaq or a major exchange.
On July 11, 2019, Nasdaq notified us that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities
(the “MVLS”) for our Common Stock was below the $35 million minimum MVLS requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(2) (the “MVLS Rule”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we had 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2020, to
regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. To regain compliance with the MVLS Rule, the minimum MVLS for our Common Stock must have been at
least $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during this 180-day period. If we failed to regain compliance with such
rule by January 7, 2020, we were subject to being be delisted from Nasdaq. If we were delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common
Stock may lose liquidity, increase volatility, and lose market maker support.
On January 8, 2020, we received a determination letter from the staff of Nasdaq stating that we had not regained compliance with the MVLS
Standard, since our Common Stock was below the $35 million minimum MVLS requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under the MLVS Rule
and had not been at least $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day grace period granted to us.
Pursuant to the letter, unless we requested a hearing to appeal this determination by January 15, 2020, our Common Stock would be delisted from
Nasdaq and trading of our Common Stock would have been suspended at the opening of business on January 17, 2020.
On January 13, 2020, we requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal the Letter and the Staff of Nasdaq notified us that
a hearing was scheduled for February 20, 2020. We were asked to provide the Panel with a plan to regain compliance with the minimum MLVS
requirement under the MLVS Rule, which needed to include a discussion of the events that we believe will enable us to timely regain compliance
with the minimum MLVS requirement. On January 21, 2020, we submitted such a compliance plan.
On March 6, 2020, we received notice from the NASDAQ hearing panel that the Company has been granted an extension until June 30, 2020
to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b), which requires us to have at least i) $2.5 million in shareholder equity; or ii) $35 million in market value of
listed securities, or iii) net income from continuing operations of at least $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last
three fiscal years. Our goal is to meet the $2.5 million minimum shareholder equity requirement for continued listing on NASDAQ. There can be no
assurance that we will regain compliance with the NASDAQ’s Listing Rule regarding our $2.5 million minimum shareholder equity requirement on
or prior to the June 30, 2020 required date. Furthermore, even if we regain compliance on or prior to such date, we must thereafter continue to
maintain compliance the continued listing rule.
COVID – 19 Pandemic - The accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, unless otherwise indicated, principally reflect the status of our business and the results of our operations as of December 31, 2019.
Since that date, economies throughout the world have been severely disrupted by the effects of the quarantines, business closures and the
reluctance of individuals to leave their homes as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Although we remain open as an “essential
business,” our supply chain has been disrupted and our customers and in particular our commercial customers have been significantly impacted
which has in turn reduced our operations and activities. In addition, the capital markets have been disrupted and our efforts to raise necessary
capital will likely be adversely impacted by the outbreak of the virus and we cannot forecast with any certainty when the disruptions caused by it
will cease to impact our business and the results of our operations. In reading the our consolidated financial statements, including our discussion of
our ability to continue as a going concern set forth herein, in each case, consider the additional uncertainties caused by the outbreak of COVID - 19.
