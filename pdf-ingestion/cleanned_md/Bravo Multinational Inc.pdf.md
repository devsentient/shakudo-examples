SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
PART I
Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs
and expenses. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words “expects,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, our
business reliance on third parties to provide us with technology, our ability to integrate and manage acquired technology,
assets, companies and personnel, changes in market condition, the volatile and intensely competitive environment in the
business sectors in which we operate, rapid technological change, and our dependence on key and scarce employees in a
competitive market for skilled personnel. These factors should not be considered exhaustive; we undertake no obligation to
release publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, as well as those discussed in the
section “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” You are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no
obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances taking place
after the date of this document.
Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
We were originally formed as Montrose Ventures, Inc. in the State of Delaware on May 25, 1989. On April 23, 1996, our name
was changed to Java Group, Inc., which tried and failed to start a chain of coffee bars. On September 1, 2004, our name was
changed to Consolidated General Corp., and under that name the company attempted to buy tier 2 and 3 professional sports
teams, including the Vancouver Ravens lacrosse team and the San Diego Soccers soccer team. On August 7, 2007, our name
was changed to Goldcorp Holdings Co. On October 15, 2010, our name was changed to GoldLand Holdings Co.
On March 22, 2016, the board of directors of the Registrant, pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
determined it was in the best interest of the Registrant that the name of the Registrant should be changed to Bravo
Multinational Incorporated, to reflect its new business, which is the purchase and leasing of gaming equipment. The change of
name was effective upon compliance with all regulatory requirements mandated by FINRA. Further, as a result of the change
of the Registrant's name the trading symbol for the shares of the Registrant's common stock has been changed to “BRVO.”
Registrant's CUSIP identifier has been changed to 10568F109.
The Registrant filed a Form 8-K with the SEC on April 7, 2016, announcing the change of name, trading symbol, and CUSIP
identifier.
On January 16, 2017, The Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles
of Incorporation in order to effect a plan of recapitalization that provides for a one-for-three hundred (1-for-300) reverse stock
split of our common stock. Pursuant to written resolutions, the shareholders of the Company voted to approve the proposal to
authorize the reverse split. The reverse stock split took effect, after filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The amended Articles of Incorporation increased the
authorized shares to 1,050,000,000, consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. The common and preferred shares will have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The preferred shares are blank check
preferred. Registrant's CUSIP identifier has been changed to 10568F208.

Former Business
Over the years, and prior to our entry into the business of the leasing of gaming equipment as described below, we have been
engaged in various businesses, including the leasing of mining claims. On September 14, 2007, we acquired an interest in
174.82 acres of land on War Eagle Mountain in Idaho from Bisell Investments Inc. and New Vision Financial Ltd., two of our
then major stockholders, for a total of 90,000,000 shares of our common stock. We acquired a 100% interest in 103 acres, and
a 29.167% interest in 76.63 acres, respectively. We also leased five placer claims on War Eagle Mountain from the U.S. Bureau
of Land Management (the “BLM”), each of which covered approximately 20 acres, or approximately 100 acres in total.
We currently own 76.63 acres within seven patented claims with a 29.167% ownership interest. We allowed all of our BLM
unpatented and placer claims to expire. We may look to expand on our mining claim holdings in the future. Currently, the
carrying value on such patented claims was fully impaired due to lack of economic viability of such properties.
For a complete discussion of the mining activities on our mining claims conducted by other parties, please see our previous
Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. However it should be noted that we were not at any time a mining operator.
As described above, the Company owns mining claims, but none of those claims are leased to a third party. Since the mining
operations of our lessee no longer have any relevance to our new business of the leasing and selling of gaming equipment, we
will only include financial information relating to revenues, expenses, and results of operations and other relevant information
with respect to the former mining activities of the lessee of our mining properties.
Current Business
We are currently engaged in the business of leasing and selling gaming equipment. We, however, ceased operations in
Nicaragua due to political and economic instabilities. We are planning to operate our business in the US and other more stable
democracies in Latin America.
On September 19, 2013, Universal Equipment SAS, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an asset purchase
agreement to acquire certain gaming equipment from Universal Entertainment SAS, Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws
of the Country of Colombia, for 17,450,535 shares of our common stock (post reverse-split on March 6, 2014). The closing
occurred on March 6, 2014. The gaming equipment included approximately 67 video poker and slot machines; eight blackjack
and miscellaneous game tables, and related furniture and equipment; roulette table and related furniture and equipment; bingo
equipment and furniture; casino chips, bill acceptors, coin counter and related equipment, and miscellaneous office equipment,
like chairs and tables.
Upon closing of the acquisition of the gaming equipment, through our wholly owned subsidiary Universal Entertainment SAS,
Inc. on March 6, 2014, we leased the gaming equipment to Vomblom & Pomare S.A., a company formed under the laws of the
Country of Colombia, and controlled by Claudia Cifuentes Robles, pursuant to a lease agreement which provided for lease
payments of $700,000 per year, payable in the amount of $58,333 per month, with a term of five years with one five year
renewal option. The gaming equipment was to be used primarily in the operation of a casino that is owned and operated by the
lessee on San Andres Isla, Colombia. However, some of the gaming equipment, such as video poker and slot machines, could
have been placed in retail locations under agreements with the retail merchants to divide winnings from the machines.
-3-

The above referred to lease agreement was cancelled by Universal Equipment SAS, Inc., on June 18, 2015, due to non-payment
of the lease payments. And, Universal Equipment SAS, Inc. ceased operations and the inventory of machines was subsequently
written-off.
On May 4, 2016 the company closed an “Equipment Purchase Contract” agreement to purchase 500 gaming machines from
Centro de Entretenimento y Diversion Mombacho S.A., a Nicaraguan corporation. The company then initiated a program to
offer for retail sale individual gaming machines. The company engaged GameTouch LLC to oversee the promotion and sale of
this equipment.
On May 30, 2017 the Company signed an agreement to purchase 100 additional gaming machines (as per the Equipment
Purchase Contracts signed May 4, 2016) for a total new advance of 100 units in aggregate at a cost of $445,000 to be paid 50%
in cash as a loan payable and 50% in common restricted stock.
On June 30, 2017 the Board of Directors agreed to provide financing for 6-month (due December 30, 2017) at 8% per annum for
gaming equipment purchases by Rentcom, Inc. for a financed amount of $76,000. The note earns $3,040 in interest, which is
due in one lump payment by December 30, 2017. The Loan is guaranteed by Douglas Brooks, Principal officer at Rentcom, Inc.
On June 30, 2017 the Board of Directors agreed to provide financing for 6-month (due December 30, 2017) at 8% per annum for
gaming equipment purchases by Investcom, Inc. for a financed amount of $152,000. This note earns $6,080 in interest, which is
due in one lump payment by December 30, 2017. The loan is guaranteed by Paul Parliament Principal Officer at Investcom, Inc.
On August 16, 2017 the Company completed an asset purchase for 300 slot and video poker machines, providing an immediate
new revenue stream for Bravo. The contract is valued at $3,618,000. These 300 gaming machines were to become operational
in numerous locations throughout Nicaragua. Management employed the services of Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion
Mombacho S.A., a Nicaraguan corporation, to manage the daily operations of the machines, and the Company pays Centro de
Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho S.A. a 25% managment fee per machine based on the net win of gaming revenues per
machine. On August 16, 2017, the Company purchased 300 gaming machines with the intention of placing these machines in
casinos where they will be producing a revenue stream monthly based on net wins of the each machine. The Company was
unable to continue its operations and therefore, the Company returned these 300 gaming machines to Centro de
Entretenimiento on December 30, 2017. In exchange, Julios Kosta owner of Centro de Entretenimiento returned 1,463,593
shares of common stock.
On August 18, 2017, the Company upgraded its shares to the QB trading platform on OTCMARKETS.COM (OTCQB.BRVO). The
OTCQB trading platform allowed the Company to obtain greater market exposure as it initiates its next steps and advances the
growth of the business.
On September 01, 2017, the Board of Directors issued a promissory note to Investcom, Inc. for $190,000 with interest at a rate
of 8% per annum for gaming equipment purchases with the note plus interest to be paid back in full on or before December 30,
2017. Investcom, Inc. is an entity owned by Paul Parliament.

During October 2017 severe weather, hurricanes, rain and flooding occurred in Nicaragua where the company had its gaming
machines operation. Lower tourism and local traffic due to these uncontrollable weather issues had an effect on the Company’s
machine revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company had purchased 300 gaming machines that were placed in
casinos where they were producing a monthly revenue stream based on net wins of the each machine. Consequently, revenue
and account receivable due on these machines cannot be collectable due to the social and economic conditions which prevailed
after the storms. Currently, the country has economic and trade sanctions in place by the U.S. Government.
On or about the first week of December 2017, Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho S.A. and GameTouch, LLC
notified management of serious issues throughout the Country of Nicaragua. Civil unrest started due to lack of simple social
services, like electricity, running water and destroyed infrastructure from Hurricane Nate. The ever growing political and civil
unrest affected the country’s economy, which had a direct effect on the gaming industry in Nicaragua. The dangerous situation
throughout Nicaragua eliminated BRVO from operating its gaming interests, effectively. On December 30, 2017, management
canceled the business contracts with both Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho S.A. and GameTouch, LLC.
Currently, the US Government placed trade and financial sanctions on the Government of Nicaragua, which greatly affected
BRVO’s business practices in the Country.
Throughout the operational year, 2018, the Company struggled to maintain its gaming operations. The politically unstable
situation in Nicaragua, in addition to US financial and trade sanctions against the current Nicaraguan Government, caused
Bravo Multinational, Inc. to reassess it gaming operations. As such, on Nov 18, 2018, management changed the direction of
the Company by evaluating gaming operations as they might exist in the USA and Canadian markets and other more stable
democracies within Latin America. Additionally, Management looked at other opportunities outside of the casino gaming
industries as those opportunities present themselves. If a viable opportunity becomes available, management will determine if
such an opportunity is accretive to the Company and can create shareholder value.

A description of our mining properties is included in “Item 1. Business” and is incorporated herein by reference. We have
written off the cost of the mining properties inasmuch as the value of any future revenue is unknown. We believe that we have
satisfactory title to our mining properties, subject to liens for taxes not yet payable, liens incident to minor encumbrances, liens
for credit arrangements and easements and restrictions that do not materially detract from the value of these properties, our
interests in these properties, or the use of these properties in a business. We believe that the mining properties are adequate
and suitable for the conduct of a mining business in the future.
Our mining claims are listed below:
Name Ownership Type of Claim Acres
Interest
Poorman Lode Claim 29.167% Patented 3.44
London Lode Claim 29.167% Patented 17.52
North Empire Lode 29.167% Patented 1.25

Oso Lode Claim 29.167% Patented 20.66
A patented mining claim is one which the federal government has passed title to the claimant, making the claimant the owner of
the surface and mineral rights. An unpatented mining claim is one which is still owned by the federal government, but which
the claimant has a right to possession to extracted minerals, provided the land is open to mineral entry.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Company for a default on money owed per terms of his Promissory Note- dated June 22, 2017. On December 28, 2018, the

As of December 31, 2018, the 2 remaining gaming machines owned by Bravo Multinational, Inc. have been written off as a non-
performing asset due to the fact the Company cannot collect on gaming monies due to the economic and political upheavals in
Nicaragua.
Throughout the operational year, 2018, the Company struggled to maintain its gaming operations. The politically unstable
situation in Nicaragua, in addition to US financial and trade sanctions against the current Nicaraguan Government, caused
Bravo Multinational, Inc. to reassess it gaming operations. As such, on Nov 18, 2018, management changed the direction of
the Company by evaluating gaming operations as they might exist in the USA and Canadian markets and other more stable
democracies within Latin America. Additionally, Management looked at other opportunities outside of the casino gaming
industries as those opportunities present themselves. If a viable opportunity becomes available, management will determine if
such an opportunity is accretive to the Company and can create shareholder value.

Reverse Stock Split

On January 16, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a one-for-three hundred (1:300) reverse
stock split. This reverse stock split became effective as of the close of business on January 16, 2017. The reverse stock split had
no effect on the par value of its common stock and did not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock but
reduced the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock by the ratio. Accordingly, the issued and outstanding
shares, stock options, net loss per share, and other per share disclosures for all periods presented have been retrospectively
adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split.

Going Concern
As of December 31, 2018, Bravo Multinational had an accumulated deficit of $29,338,722.
While we are attempting to generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations.
Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues will improve the Company's operating
results. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, we
may not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our
business plan and generate revenues. This issue is addressed in footnote 4 to the financial statements.
Year Ended December 31, 2018, compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017
Revenues for the Company’s year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $-0- and for year ended December 31, 2017 totaled
$1,815,978 from sales of its gaming machines. The decrease to $-0- in 2018 from $1,815,978 during the same period ended
December 31, 2017 was attributed to decreases in sales of the Company’s gaming machines. No machines sales occurred
throughout the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the civil and governmental unrest throughout Nicaragua which caused
the Company to suspend its gaming operations in this area.
Cost of Goods Sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $-0- compared to $1,356,326 for year ended December 31,
2017. The decrease to $-0- in cost of goods sold was due to decrease in the number of gaming machines sold, -0- machines sold
were sold in 2018 compared to 242 machines sold in 2017.
Gross margins in 2018 and 2017 were 0% and 25.3%. Respectively, the decrease in 2018 to 0% was due to no gaming machine
sold compared to 242 gaming machines sold in 2017.
Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $-0- as compared to gross profit for $459,652 for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The decrease to $0- in December 31, 2018 compared to $459,652 in gross profit for the period December
31, 2017 was due to no sales of the gaming machines.
General and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $19,620 compared to $597,484 for
December 31, 2017, primarily the decrease was attributed to the scaled back in the Company's operations due to suspending its
gaming machine business in Nicaragua.

Net Loss
Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are $1,400,441 and $1,765,004, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
As of December 31, 2018, our assets totaled $10,234, which consisted of mainly cash, prepaid expenses, and property &
equipment- net of accumulative depreciation. The Company’s total liabilities were $2,084,086 which consisted of accounts
payable accrued expenses / fees, customer deposits, amounts due to related parties, accrued board of director fees, and stock
payables to related parties. As of this date the Company had an accumulated deficit of $29,338,722 and working capital of
deficit of $2,073,852.
As of December 31, 2017, our assets totaled $474, which consisted of mainly cash and property & equipment- net of
accumulative depreciation. The Company’s total liabilities were $2,180,140 which consisted of accounts payable accrued
expenses / fees and director loans. As of this date the Company had an accumulated deficit of $27,938,281 and working capital
of deficit of $2,179,666.
Our independent auditors, in their report on the financial statements, have indicated that the Company’s significant operating
losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation
of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to
pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will
either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan (See Note 4 in
Financial Statements). For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its CEO to advance funds as
necessary to meeting our operating requirement.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Bravo Multinational Incorporated does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a
significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries’ operating results, financial position, or cash flow.
Accounting Principals
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its
financial statements, including those dealing with revenue recognition. The Company does not believe that there are any other
new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606), which was further updated
in March, April, May and December 2016. The guidance in this update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition." Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract
with a customer.
-17-

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), revenues are recognized when control
of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect
to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps:
(1) Identify the contract with a client; (2)Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction
price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the
company satisfies a performance obligation.
We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any,
on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities
within them.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The financial statements and related notes are included as part of this report as indexed in the appendix on page F-1, et seq.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
During the last two fiscal years, we have had no disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. On
April 12, 2017 the Board of Directors of Bravo Multinational Incorporated (the "Company") were notified of the resignation of
Kappin Professional Corporation - Certified Public Accountants and Chartered Accountants, Toronto, Canada (Kappin) as the
Company's independent accountants, effective immediately. Kappin was retained and the Company never filed with the SEC
audited financial statements which used the opinion of Kappin. Following Kappin's resignation on April 12, 2017 the Board
appointed the firm of BF Borges CPA PC, to serve as the Company's independent public accountants. On April 16, 2017, BF
Borges CPA PC became the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm. They are located in Colorado (see
Form 8-K filed April 14, 2017).

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls
and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of
material weaknesses identified, determined that our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of December 31, 2018.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and;
-19-

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used May 2013
updated criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies.
We identified the following deficiencies which together constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018:
· The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design.
· During the y e ar ended December 31, 2018, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting
process, including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for
the preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times
by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result
in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and
related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our
interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
· The Company is continuing the process of remediating its control deficiencies. However, the material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting that has been identified will not be remediated until numerous internal
controls are implemented and operate for a period of time, are tested, and the Company is able to conclude that such
internal controls are operating effectively. The Company cannot provide assurance that these procedures will be
successful in identifying material errors that may exist in the financial statements. The Company cannot make
assurances that it will not identify additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in the
future. Management plans, as capital becomes available to the Company, to increase the accounting and financial
reporting staff and provide future investments in the continuing education and public company accounting training of
our accounting and financial professionals.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control
system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management's
report in this annual report.
We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting to ensure we maintain an effective internal control
environment. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2018
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Committees of the Board
We currently have an Executive Committee of our board of directors which was established on March 24, 2015. However, we
do not currently have an Audit, Finance, Compensation, or Nominating Committee, or any other committee of the board of
directors. We have adopted a charter for the Executive Committee as well as charters for the other committees, in the event
that we elect to implement them. Copies of the charters for each committee have been previously filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In addition, we have posted copies of the charters for each committee on our website at
www.bravomultinational.com. We will provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of the charter for any of our
committees. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law concerning any amendments
to our committees or their charters. Any such request should be directed to Mr. Richard Kaiser, our corporate secretary, at
3419 Virginia Beach Boulevard, Unit 252, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452, telephone (757) 306-6090, or you may email Mr.
Kaiser at info@bravomultinational.com. The information contained in our website shall not constitute part of this filing.
For the areas where we don’t have committees, such responsibilities of these committees are fulfilled by our board of directors
and all of our directors participate in such responsibilities, none of whom is “independent” as defined under Rule 4200(a)(15) of
the NASDAQ’s listing standards described below. Our financial constraints have made it extremely difficult to attract and retain
qualified independent board members. Since we do not have any of the subject committees, other than our Executive
Committee, our entire board of directors participates in all of the considerations with respect to our audit, finance,
compensation, and nomination deliberations.
-22-

Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ’s listing standards defines an “independent director” as a person other than an executive
officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the issuer’s board of
directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The
following persons shall not be considered independent:
· A director who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by the company;
· A director who accepted or who has a Family Member who accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of
$120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of
independence, other than the following: (i) compensation for board or board committee service; (ii) compensation paid
to a Family Member who is an employee (other than as an executive officer) of the Company; or (iii) benefits under a
tax-qualified retirement plan, or non-discretionary compensation. Provided, however, that in addition to the
requirements contained in this paragraph, audit committee members are also subject to additional, more stringent
requirements under NASDAQ Rule 4350(d).
· A director who is a Family Member of an individual who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed
by the Company as an executive officer;
· A director who is, or has a Family Member who is, a partner in, or a controlling stockholder or an executive officer of,
any organization to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments for property or
services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed five percent of the recipient’s consolidated
gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever is more, other than the following: (i) payments arising solely
from investments in the Company’s securities; or (ii) payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution
matching programs;
· A director of the issuer who is, or has a Family Member who is, employed as an executive officer of another entity
where at any time during the past three years any of the executive officers of the issuer serve on the compensation
committee of such other entity; or
· A director who is, or has a Family Member who is, a current partner of the Company’s outside auditor, or was a
partner or employee of Bravo’s outside auditor who worked on the Company’s audit at any time during any of the past
three years.
-23-

We hope to add qualified independent members of our board of directors at a later date, depending upon our ability to reach
and maintain financial stability.
Executive Committee
In accordance with Article III of our Bylaws, our board of directors has established an Executive Committee which consists of
members who have been appointed by the board of directors. The initial chairman of the Executive Committee was Paul
Parliament. As a result of the Transaction, Mr. Parliament has agreed to resign his position with the Company, and he will be
replaced in this position by Mr. Ferguson. Thereafter, the chairman of the Executive Committee shall be appointed by the
members of the Executive Committee. The remaining member of the Executive Committee following the Transaction is Richard
Kaiser. The members of the Executive Committee shall serve at the pleasure of the board of directors or until their successors
shall be duly designated. Vacancies in the Executive Committee shall be filled by the board of directors.
During the intervals between the meetings of the board of directors, the Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all of
the authority of the board of directors in the management of the business affairs of Bravo to the extent authorized by the
resolution providing for the Executive Committee or by subsequent resolution adopted by a majority of the whole board of
directors. This authorization is subject to the limitations imposed by law, the bylaws of Bravo Multinational Incorporated or the
board of directors.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Executive Committee held no formal meetings.
Audit Committee

The entire board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee, but no written charter governs the actions of the
board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit committee. The board approves the
selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to discuss issues related to
financial reporting. In addition, the board reviews the scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews
with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal
accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent
auditor and the performance of the independent auditor. At the present time, Richard Kaiser, our chief financial officer is
considered to be our expert in financial and accounting matters.
-24-

Nominating Committee
Our size and the size of our board, at this time, do not require a separate nominating committee. This function is performed by
the entire board of directors. When evaluating director nominees, our directors consider the following factors:
· The appropriate size of our board of directors;
· Our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors;
· The knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in finance, administration or public service, in
light of prevailing business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members
of the board;
· Experience in political affairs;
· Experience with accounting rules and practices; and
· The desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new
board members.
Our goal is to assemble a board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and
professional experience. In doing so, the board will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds.
-25-

Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the board may also consider
such other factors as it may deem in our best interests as well as in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, the
board identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the board willing to continue in service. Current members
of the board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are
considered for re-nomination. If any member of the board does not wish to continue in service or if the board decides not to re-
nominate a member for re-election, the board then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the
criteria above. Current members of the board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above.
The board may also engage in research to identify qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify
or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search
firm, if necessary. The board does not typically consider stockholder nominees because it believes that its current nomination
process is sufficient to identify directors who serve our best interests.
Finance Committee
Although we currently do not have a Finance Committee, we have adopted a charter which provides that when established it
will oversee all areas of corporate finance for Bravo and its subsidiaries, including capital structure, equity and debt financings,
capital expenditures, cash management, banking activities and relationships, investments, foreign exchange activities and share
repurchase activities. The Finance Committee will consist of a minimum of three members of the board of directors, the
majority of whom shall meet the same independence and experience requirements of the Audit Committee of Bravo and the
applicable provisions of federal law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the applicable rules of the OTC
Market, the NASDAQ Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or any other exchange where the shares of Bravo may be
listed or quoted for sale. The members of the Finance Committee are to be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and are appointed by and serve at the discretion of the board of directors.
Compensation Committee
Although we currently do not have a Compensation Committee, we have adopted a charter which provides that when
established it is to assist the board of directors in meeting its responsibilities with regard to oversight and determination of
executive compensation and to review and make recommendations to the board of directors with respect to major compensation
plans, policies and programs of Bravo. The Compensation Committee shall consist of not fewer than two members of the board
of directors, with the exact number being determined by the board. Members of the Compensation Committee shall be
appointed from time to time to serve in such capacity by the Board. Each member shall meet the independence and outside
director requirements of applicable tax and securities laws and regulations and stock market rules.
Conflicts of Interest
-26-

With respect to transactions involving real or apparent conflicts of interest, we have adopted written policies and procedures,
which are contained in our Corporate Governance Principles, and which require that:
· The fact of the relationship or interest giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who
authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization or approval;
· The transaction to be approved by a majority of our disinterested directors; and
· The transaction to be fair and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors.
Code of Ethics for Senior Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers
We have adopted an amended Code of Ethics for Senior Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers that applies to our
president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and all financial officers, including the principal
accounting officer. The code provides as follows:
· Each officer is responsible for full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in all periodic reports and financial
disclosures required to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission or disclosed to our stockholders and/or
the public.
· Each officer shall immediately bring to the attention of the audit committee, or disclosure compliance officer, any material
information of which the officer becomes aware that affects the disclosures made by us in our public filings and assist the
audit committee or disclosure compliance officer in fulfilling its responsibilities for full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in all periodic reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
· Each officer shall promptly notify our general counsel, if any, or the president or chief executive officer as well as the audit
committee of any information he may have concerning any violation of our Code of Business Conduct or our Code of Ethics,
including any actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, involving any
management or other employees who have a significant role in our financial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.
-27-

· Each officer shall immediately bring to the attention of our general counsel, if any, the president or the chief executive
officer and the audit committee any information he may have concerning evidence of a material violation of the securities or
other laws, rules or regulations applicable to us and the operation of our business, by us or any of our agents.
· Any waiver of this Code of Ethics for any officer must be approved, if at all, in advance by a majority of the independent
directors serving on our board of directors. Any such waivers granted will be publicly disclosed in accordance with
applicable rules, regulations and listing standards.
Code of Business Conduct
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct, which applies to Bravo and all of our subsidiaries, whereby we expect each
employee to use sound judgment to help us maintain appropriate compliance procedures and to carry out our business in
compliance with laws and high ethical standards. Each of our employees is expected to read our Code of Business Conduct and
demonstrate personal commitment to the standards set forth in our Code of Business Conduct. Our officers and other
supervising employees are expected to be leaders in demonstrating this personal commitment to the standards outlined in our
Code of Business Conduct and recognizing indications of illegal or improper conduct. All employees are expected to report
appropriately any indications of illegal or improper conduct. An employee who does not comply with the standards set forth in
our Code of Business Conduct may be subject to discipline in light of the nature of the violation, including termination of
employment.
Copies of our Corporate Governance Principles, our amended Code of Ethics for Senior Executive Officers and Senior Financial
Officers, and our Code of Business Conduct have been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will
provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of our Corporate Governance Principles, our amended Code of
Ethics for Senior Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers, and our Code of Business Conduct. In addition, we intend to
post on our website all disclosures that are required by law concerning any amendments to our Corporate Governance
Principles, our amended Code of Ethics for Senior Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers, and our Code of Business
Conduct. Any request for review of such documents should be directed to Mr. Richard Kaiser, our corporate secretary, at 3419
Virginia Beach Boulevard, Unit 252, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452, telephone (757) 306-6090, or email him at
info@bravomultinational.com. The information contained on our website shall not constitute part of this Information
Statement.
Board of Directors Meetings
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our board of directors held three (3) formal meetings and no meetings were held
where board actions were taken by written consent. All of Bravo’s directors attended 100% of our meetings in 2018.

Communication with Directors
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact any of our directors by writing to them at Bravo Multinational
Incorporated, 3419 Virginia Beach Boulevard, Unit 252, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452, Attention: Corporate Secretary,
telephone 757-306-6092, or email at info@bravomultinational.com.
Our board has approved a process for handling letters received by us and addressed to any of our directors. Under that
process, our vice president reviews all such correspondence and regularly forwards to the directors a summary of all such
correspondence, together with copies of all such correspondence that, in the opinion of our vice president, deal with functions
of the board or committees thereof or that he otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time review
a log of all correspondence received by us that are addressed to members of the board and request copies of such
correspondence.
Item 11. Executive Compensation.
Summary of Cash and Certain Other Compensation
At present, Bravo Multinational has three executive officers. Beginning in March 2015, the compensation program for our
executives consists of three key elements:
· A base salary;
· Additional compensation; and
· Periodic grants and/or options of our common stock.
Base Salary. Our executive officers receive compensation based on such factors as competitive industry salaries, a subjective
assessment of the contribution and experience of the officer, and the specific recommendation by our board of directors.
Additional Compensation. Each of our officers receives additional compensation as provided in the officer’s employment
agreement. All payments to officers must be approved by our board of directors or compensation committee based on the
individual officer’s performance and company performance.
Stock Incentive. Stock grants and options are awarded to executive officers based on their positions and individual
performance. Stock grants and options provide incentive for the creation of stockholder value over the long term and aid
significantly in the recruitment and retention of executive officers. The board of directors or compensation committee
considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer for stock grants and options to executive officers (other than the
chief executive officer) and approves, disapproves or modifies such recommendation. Stock grants and options for our
executive officers will be recommended and approved by our board of directors. See “Market Price of and Dividends on our
Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters - Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans.”

Mr. Parliament violated the short swing profit rules by buying and selling stock of the Company during 2017 within a 6 month
period. As a result the Company penalized Mr. Parliament by withholding compensation that was due to Mr. Parliament in the
amount of profit he earned on those trades - i.e. $4,247.
On November 19, 2018, Mr. Parliament resigned his positions with the Company and he is no longer an officer or director of the
Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the board of directors of Bravo Multinational Incorporated:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bravo Multinational Incorporated and its subsidiaries ("the Company") as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Going concern uncertainty
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to
the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 4. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
/s/ B F Borgers CPA PC
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.

BRAVO MULTINATIONAL INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – Organization & Description of Business
Bravo Multinational Corporation (the “Company,” “we” or “us”) was originally formed as Montrose Ventures, Inc. in the State of Delaware on May
25, 1989. On April 23, 1996, the Company’s name was changed to Java Group, Inc., and on September 1, 2004 the name was changed to
Consolidated General Corp. On August 7, 2007, the company’s name was changed to GoldCorp Holdings Co. On October 15, 2010, our name was
changed to GoldLand Holdings Co. On April 6, 2016, we changed our corporate name to Bravo Multinational Incorporated. On March 22, 2016, the
board of directors of the company, pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, determined it was in the best interests of the
company that the name of the company should be changed to Bravo Multinational Incorporated, with such change of name to be effective upon
compliance with all regulatory requirements mandated by FINRA. Further, as a result of the change of the company’s name and upon satisfaction
of all regulatory requirements, the trading symbol for the shares of the company’s common stock should be changed to “BRVO,” and the company’s
CUSIP identifier be changed to a newly issued number. FINRA granted its approval of the change of the company’s name on April 6, 2016. As a
result of the change of name of the company, the company’s trading symbol was changed to “BRVO” and the CUSIP identifier was changed to
10568F109.
The Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC on April 7, 2016, announcing the change of name, trading symbol, and CUSIP identifier.
The Company owns land and lease claims on War Eagle Mountain in the state of Idaho. The Company has entered into a lease agreement with
Silver Falcon Mining, Inc. (SFMI) under which SFMI is entitled to mine the land and the Company is entitled to a 15% net royalty on all minerals
extracted by SFMI from tailing piles on the premises or through shafts or adits located on the premises. The lease agreement was deferred for a
two year period, 2014 and 2015, so that SFMI could restructure is finances. The Company has now determined that SFMI is unable to pay the lease
and that any debt owing by SFMI to the company is not recoverable. The carrying value on such claims both patented and unpatented was fully
impaired due to lack of economic viabilities of such properties.
The Company is currently engaged in the business of buying and reselling gaming equipment. The Company also buys machines for its own use
that are placed in casinos or gaming areas to obtain monthly revenue streams from the machines’ net win revenue.
On May 4, 2016 the company entered into an agreement to purchase 500 gaming machines from Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho
S.A., a Nicaraguan corporation, a company owned by our consultant and major shareholder, Julios Kosta. On May 6, 2016 the transaction closed
and an initial purchase of 150 gaming machines was completed, with the balance of machines to be purchased over approximately 18 months prior
to December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2017 this contract was terminated along with the contract with GameTouch LLC.
This initial purchase was paid for with the issuance of 41,667 common restricted shares valued at $337,500 of the registrant and an open loan held
by the seller in the amount of $337,500 at an annual rate of 3.5%. Through the year ended December 31, 2016, the company contracted
GameTouch LLC, a company owned by our consultant and major shareholder, Julios Kosta to re-sell this equipment. For each gaming machine that
GameTouch sells they will receive a commission of $950.

During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company purchased 200 machines from Centro de Entretenimiento to fulfill its contract. Due to civil
unrest and the devastation of Hurricane Nate in Nicaragua in October 2017, the Company wrote off the remaining two (2) machines that were held
in inventory on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $9,000.
On August 16, 2017, the Company purchased 300 gaming machines with the intention of placing these machines in casinos where they will be
producing a revenue stream monthly based on net wins of the each machine. Due to the civil unrest and the devastation of Hurricane Nate in
Nicaragua in October 2017 the Company was unable to continue its operations and therefore, the Company returned these 300 gaming machines to
Centro de Entretenimiento on December 30, 2017 which had a value of $3,618,000, accumulated depreciation of $258,325 and a note payable of
$1,748,700. In exchange, Julios Kosta owner of Centro de Entretenimiento returned 1,463,593 shares of common stock.
NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bravo Multinational Incorporated, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Universal
Entertainment SAS, Ltd., (the “Company”). All significant inter-company balances have been eliminated in consolidation. During the year ended
December 31, 2017, management recognized that Universal is an inactive Florida corporation which no longer operates.
Method of Accounting
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents may include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three
months or less. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions located in the United States, which periodically may
exceed federally insured amounts.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms which are recorded at net realizable value. The Company establishes
an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management's assessment of collectability of trade receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is
required in assessing the amount of the allowance. The Company makes judgments about creditworthiness of each customer based on ongoing
credit evaluations and monitors current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. If the financial condition of the
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a specific allowance will be required.

NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – continued
Inventory
The Company calculates inventory utilizing the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) valued at the individually identified cost per machine. If the
estimated net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, and is lower than its cost, the inventory item is
written down to its estimated net realizable value, which is valued at each reporting period. Provisions for inventory write-downs are included in
cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Once written down, inventories are carried at this lower cost basis until sold
or scrapped. Due to civil unrest and the devastation of Hurricane Nate in Nicaragua in October 2017, the Company wrote off the remaining two (2)
machines that were held in inventory on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $9,000. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 there were -0- gaming
machines in inventory valued at $-0-.
Earnings (Loss) per Share
Earnings (loss) per share of common stock are computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. Basic earnings (loss) per share
are computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
each period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming conversion of all
potentially dilutive stock options, warrants and convertible securities, if dilutive. Common stock equivalents that are anti-dilutive are excluded from
both diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding and diluted earnings (loss) per share.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company has issued and may issue stock in lieu of cash for certain transactions. The fair value of the stock, which is based on comparable cash
purchases, third party fair values of shares or the value of services, whichever is more readily determinable, is used to value the transaction.
Fair Value Measurements
The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These estimates
involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable
approximate fair value.
We adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements.
F-9

BRAVO MULTINATIONAL INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – continued
Fair Value Measurements - continued
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
· Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
· Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
and
· Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value
drivers are unobservable.
The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These
estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, inventory, notes payable,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities approximate fair value given their short term nature or effective interest rates. We measure certain financial
instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.
Revenue Recognition
Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the new revenue standard is
expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue
recognition and the control activities within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the
new revenue standard, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information provided for disclosures.
The Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold from product sales or services rendered when control of the promised goods are
transferred to our clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the
contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or
as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The guidance requires increased disclosures, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

BRAVO MULTINATIONAL INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – continued
Revenue Recognition – continued
The Company operates as one reportable segment.
Gaming machine revenue is the net win from gaming machines which is the difference between gaming wins and losses. Revenue is recognized at
month end when the gaming win/loss is calculated. Gaming win/loss revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $-0- and
$148,478, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided for on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Computer equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over five (5) years. Equipment used to generate revenues is depreciated on the
straight-line method over seven (7) years and is included in cost of sales. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the
property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments or renewals are capitalized when incurred.
I m pairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management evaluates the Company’s long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, that consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, for
indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
such assets. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying amount of the asset over the estimated
fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values
and third-party independent appraisers, as considered necessary.
Beneficial Conversion Feature
In accordance with FASB ASC 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options” the Company records a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”)
related to the issuance of convertible debt or preferred stock instruments that have conversion features at fixed rates that are in-the-money when
issued. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of
that feature to additional paid-in capital. The intrinsic value is generally calculated at the commitment date as the difference between the
conversion price and the fair value of the common stock or other securities into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of
shares into which the security is convertible. If certain other securities are issued with the convertible security, the proceeds are allocated among
the different components. The portion of the proceeds allocated to the convertible security is divided by the contractual number of the conversion
shares to determine the effective conversion price, which is used to measure the BCF. The effective conversion price is used to compute the
intrinsic value. The value of the BCF is limited to the basis that is initially allocated to the convertible security.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and
does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. We will adopt the standard on fiscal year January 1,
2019. Based on our assessment of the new standard on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which will consist primarily of a balance
sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities, we have concluded that the impact will be
insignificant to our condensed consolidated financial statements based on the short-term nature of our leases and our election of such practical
expedient.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) to expand the scope of ASC 718, Compensation -
Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (“ASU 2018-07”), to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from
nonemployees. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still evaluating this ASU and anticipates it will not have significant impact on our condensed
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
NOTE 4 – Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring losses from operations. As a result,
there is an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2018.
While the Company is attempting to continue operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to
support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management
believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company’s business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues.
NOTE 5 – Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31, 2018 and 2017:
December 31, 2018 2017
Accounts Receivable $ 42,312 $ 42,312
Less: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (42,312) (42,312)

Due to civil unrest and the devastation of Hurricane Nate in Nicaragua in October 2017, the Company wrote off the machine income that was in
accounts receivable on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $42,312.
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $42,312 was collected but it remains in Nicaragua because of the political instability, social
unrest, and US Government's trade and economic sanctions; no transfer of funds to the US can be done at this time. Since these issues have yet to
be resolved both domestically and internationally with Nicaragua, the $42,312 amount has not been paid in the US and has been written-off. Since
the revenue was earned and collected in Nicaragua, the revenue remains recognized as an account receivable.

Company’s former chief executive officer, for a total of $770,000. The sales were financed by a notes receivable in the amount of $342,000. Due to
uncertainty of repayment, the notes receivable of $342,000 were allowed for as a bad debt at December 31, 2017 (See Note 6). The above
mentioned sales were also paid for by reducing Mr. Parliaments’ note payable from the Company in the amount of $76,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 the Company sold 20 gaming machines to Richard A. Kaiser Sr., the parent of the Director, Richard

* Per board approval, on March 13, 2018, all director loans will be paid by converting to stock at a rate of $0.10 per share. Because the conversion
