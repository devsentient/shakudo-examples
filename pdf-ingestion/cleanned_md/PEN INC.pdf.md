PART I
Item 1. Business
PEN develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products enabled by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for
customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of
products enabled by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, CLARITY DEFOGIT brand defogging products and
CLARITY ULTRASEAL nanocoating products for glass and ceramics. We also sell an environmentally friendly surface protector, fortifier, and
cleaner. Our design center conducts product development services for us and for government and private customers and develops and sells
printable inks and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows.
PEN was formed in 2014, and it is the successor to Applied Nanotech Holdings Inc. that had been formed in 1989. In the combination that created
PEN, Nanofilm, Ltd. acquired Applied Nanotech Holdings, Inc. Our principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities and
types of products sold. This is consistent with our internal reporting structure. Our two reportable segments for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017 were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment (which we formerly called the Research and development
segment).
Product Segment
Revenue is based on the retail and institutional sale of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the
surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. Our consumer products are sold as liquids, gels, foam and as wet and dry towelettes. Institutional products
are sold in liquid form enabling application by a variety of common commercial techniques We rely on intellectual property including trade secret
formulations to protect our proprietary technology.
We have three broad product technology platforms that offer solutions to some common problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing fogging,
preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear. All our products have some “nano” characteristic about them –
whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20
nanometers or less in thickness.
Our consumer products are primarily customized optical cleaning and de-fogging treatments. In our consumer products, we strive to create
segment leading brands that are sustainable, of high quality, and that are both easy and safe to apply. Institutional products include a family of
coating liquids that create very thin, strongly-bound, clear coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surface and a series of clear coatings for
plastics incorporating submicron size particles to improve abrasion resistance and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. We
manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial
partners bring to the marketplace.
Our products encompass:
● Liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for eyeglass and sunglass lens cleaning and protection.
● Liquid formulation packaged for retail and institutional sale for cleaning and creating hygienic surfaces unfriendly to germs.
● Anti-fogging liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including face
shields, and sporting goggles.
● Anti-fogging towelettes for sale to the military for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and other applications
such as head’s up displays,
● Mar resistant and stain resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as restaurants,
cruise ships, casinos.
● Clear protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include automotive
and hand-held devices.
● Protective and water repelling coatings on interior glass and ceramic surfaces to make it easy to clean and prevent scale and grime
encrustation.
● Coatings for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces
to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses.
4

We also believe that products enabled by nanotechnology can tackle and solve big, global problems in selected growing markets. We have three
primary areas of new product focus:
1. Health: Treating or printing of surfaces at the nano-scale to promote health, fight the spread of disease, and assist in the arms race against
superbugs;
2. Safety: “Smelling” at the nano-scale level to identify hazardous conditions, alert those in danger, and initiate steps to prevent catastrophe;
and
3. Sustainability: Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using the minimal amounts of safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing
methods, and avoiding using harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible.
In 2016, we introduced into the institutional market a hygienic product that creates surfaces unfriendly to germs. Several patent applications
related to the formulation have issued. The product is safe for use on many surfaces, both natural and man-made. After application, the product
continues to fortify and protect, keeping a clean and healthy surface.
We believe that our manufacturing capacity and contractors with whom we have established relationships will enable us to fill orders for the new
product. Ingredients and packaging materials are readily available from a number of suppliers.
Marketing and Distribution
We sell our consumer products directly to retailers in the United States. Historically we have relied heavily on outside agents and distributors but
since the last half of 2018 we have emphasized internal sales efforts. Our industrial products are sold directly to customers who frequently use our
products in their own branded products.
Manufacturing Operations
We manufacture, pack and label at our 26,000-square foot facility in Brooklyn Heights Ohio.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our nanotechnology expertise and related intellectual property used in our current products is specialized in the areas of surface science,
molecular self-assembly, transparent composites, and surfactants. The intellectual property developed from this work is protected with a
combination of selective patents and primarily by trade secrets. This intellectual property strategy is like that used by leading companies in the
fragrance and flavors industry. No single patent is significant to any of our commercial products.
Competition
Products sold into the optical segment have a small number of significant competitors. Our products are known to be the “benchmark” products in
these segments and generally outperform our competitors’. Some of our products in these segments do compete for certain customers or certain
applications against lower priced, traditional materials. Most of the companies selling products into these market segments are privately-held, U.S.
packaging or catalog companies. Examples in the U.S. include Hilco Accessories, California Accessories, and Amcon Laboratories and,
internationally, the catalog company, Prosben, Inc., from the Peoples Republic of China. In the nano-coating products area or the anti-fog product
line we are not aware of any competitive products that match our product performance or processing characteristics.
Products sold into the hygienic, germ-unfriendly market have a diverse variety of potential competitors. Potential competitors fall into the general
category of germ-killing cleaners, known as disinfectants. These disinfectants rely on the use of government-approved pesticides as their active
ingredient. Examples include bleach, benzalkonium chloride, and alcohols. All disinfectant products require the use of protective gloves and masks
for their safe use. Examples in the U.S. include the Clorox Company, GOJO Industries, Inc., and Reckitt Benckiser, Inc. Since our products do not
include germ-killing pesticides and do not require protective clothing, it is unclear how customers will perceive our products as compared to these
potential competitors.
5

Backlog
Sales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of products. We do not believe that a backlog as of any date is indicative of future
results. Some agreements give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of products during a specified period, but these agreements do
not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity. The quantities purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are
frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. Because of our relatively small size, a customer’s delay of
a product shipment can make a difference in the results for an accounting period.
Geographical Information
All long-lived assets are in the United States.
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
We use third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the United States to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging
products. As is customary in our industry, historically we have not had long-term or exclusive agreements with third-party suppliers and have
generally made purchases through purchase orders. In the last quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 we terminated most of our outside
contract and toll manufacturing, bringing our manufacturing back in house. We believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and
manufacturers and that there are alternative sources should one or more of these suppliers or manufacturers become unavailable. However, the
disruption of our operations if a change becomes necessary and the likelihood of shipment delays means that the loss of, or a significant adverse
change in our relationship with, any of our key suppliers or manufacturers, or any other supply change disruptions could have a material adverse
effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Key Customers
A limited number of key customers historically accounted for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue. Delays in shipping customer orders
caused two major customers to advise us in May, 2018 that they would stop buying our products. These customers represented 38% of our revenue
for 2018 and 39% of our revenue for 2017. These customers were less than 10% of revenue after the first quarter of 2018.
Contract Services Segment
Our Contract services segment functions as the design center for our new products as well as performing work for government agencies and
private strategic partners. Formerly called the research and development segment, this segment has moved away from areas of research that do
not involve product development, especially government contracts that require us to fund part of the research cost. This segment is now involved in
proof of concepts and prototypes for proposed PEN products and development work under contract for government and private entities. In our
work on products for PEN we focus only on submicron size particles, not smaller nanoparticles that are subject to much greater government
regulation. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:
● Nanosensor technology;
● Nanoelectronics; and
● Submicron particle formulations and materials for health and safety products.
Much of our contract product development work is done under government contracts. Government contracts frequently limit profit on work done.
With private development contracts, there is a relationship between revenues received under the contract and rights granted to the licensee under
the contract. Our short-term goal when we work for others is to cover all out of pocket costs and contribute to our overall overhead. Our long-term
goal is to become a trusted supplier of products to our development partners.

We have had small scale success with commercial sales of conductive inks and pastes and from thermal management materials. Our graphene foils
are also sold commercially but the size of the market is small. Product sales typically come from repeat business or from customer inquiries in our
areas of expertise.
We continue to focus on stabilizing our financial situation and operating this segment at break-even or better based solely on revenues from our
development activities.
Nanoelectronics Applications – Inks and Pastes
Metallic Inks & Pastes
Copper Inks - As flexible electronics grow, soldering is disappearing. New digital and additive manufacturing processes allow industries to move
from the design process directly to the production line. We believe that only submicron particles are capable of producing inks that are compatible
with the nozzles used in digital printing.
We sell copper inks and pastes to a variety of customers around the world. Certain of our products based on nano-copper are available only outside
Asia under agreements with our former research partner Ishihara Chemical Company, Ltd., that has exclusive rights in Asia to patents developed
under research contracts with them. Other copper products that we sell are available worldwide.
Other metallic inks – Our technology and development work in conductive inks also resulted in conductive inks and pastes using nickel, silver, and
aluminum rather than copper. Research partners who funded some of our work using silver and aluminum have exclusive rights to certain products
for solar applications. We are not restricted in using products for other applications, and we can sell into the solar field our products that do not
infringe those specific patents.
There are silver inks on the market today, but because of the high cost of silver relative to copper, a successful copper or copper-alloy ink is likely
to be of greater commercial interest to potential customers. Most inks and pastes sold in commercial quantities today are manufactured and sold by
large multinational chemical companies. For example, the two largest suppliers of inks and pastes for solar cell production are DuPont and Ferro.
We are unable to compete directly with companies of that size in established silver ink markets.
Technical Inks Printing Solution (TIPS)
Conductive inks have the potential to revolutionize many types of electronics manufacturing. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive solution
for end users not just by developing inks, but assisting in the process from start to finish. We call this our Technical Inks Printing Solution. We have
also formed relationships with hardware manufacturers with the goal of providing seamless integration into high volume manufacturing for
companies wishing to use conductive inks in their manufacturing processes. In addition to traditional 2D printing applications, we developed a
multifunctional copper ink for 3D printing applications, the fastest growing segment of printed electronics.
Numerous other companies are working with other technologies for the commercial use of conductive inks and pastes. The commercialization of
products using our technology depends on the results of our development work compared with results achieved by others, as well as other factors
including raw material costs, marketing, resources, and production capabilities.
Sensors
Our approach to sensor technology offers the unique advantage of recognizing and sometimes measuring materials at the molecular level. Our
competition in the sensor area will come from a variety of technologies and companies depending on the purpose and use of the sensor. The areas
where we are currently active are:
Ion Mobility Sensors. We are developing sensors based on Ion Mobility Sensor (“IMS”) technology focusing on Differential Mobility Spectroscopy
(“DMS”). These sensors are ideal for use when both high sensitivity and high selectivity (low false positives) are required. We have improved on
existing IMS and DMS technology by developing our proprietary nonradioactive gas ionization sources to replace the radioactive isotopes that are
traditionally used in these tools.
7

Hydrogen and Methane Sensors. Hydrogen sensors were initially targeted for use in fuel cells for automobiles and for remote monitoring of large
power transformers. We developed a hydrogen sensor for use in the measurement of hydrogen in power transformer products. Currently, we are
not aware of commercial interest in hydrogen sensors.
Methane gas detectors that we developed for use in the natural gas industry under funding from the Northeast Gas Association have achieved UL
1484 certification for Residential Gas Detectors. In 2018, the Northeast Gas Association completed a field test and reliability study of these sensors.
The results have led to further work to improve the performance of these detectors beyond the UL 1484 standards.
Carbon Monoxide Sensors. We have developed a low-power carbon monoxide sensor that can last for 10,000 hours on a single battery. The sensor
will be specific to carbon monoxide with no cross sensitivity to other gases and elements and is also easily portable and highly sensitive.
Submicron Particle Formulations and Materials for Health and Safety Applications
Our work in the health and safety area builds on our understanding of certain compounds from our extensive work related to inks and pastes. The
understanding of the chemistry of these particles and their interaction with surfactants and other solutions was combined with research and
development work done for products already sold commercially resulted in new product concepts and materials with superior properties for
applications in the field of health and safety.
Using our experience with metallic inks and our prior work with carbon nanotube composites we developed a new thin carbon foil made of layers of
graphene for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals used by the medical field in Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging. We supply graphene foil to institutional customers who make nuclear pharmaceuticals. We are working to develop graphene windows and
targets to be used by customers in this industry. The extent to which our customers are successful in the nuclear pharmaceutical marketplace is
outside our control.
Intellectual Property Rights
An important part of our overall business and product development strategy is to protect our intellectual property and, when appropriate, we seek
patent protection for our products and proprietary technology. Historically, we made filings in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions.
Beginning in 2014, as a cost saving measure, we became much more selective in filing patents and reduced the number of jurisdictions where we
act to protect our rights. Still, our patent portfolio consists of approximately 20 patents, including issued patents and patent applications pending
before foreign and United States Patent and Trademark Offices. Trade secret protection is also important to our products.
The patenting of technology-related products and processes involves uncertain and complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards
change from time to time, and administrative and court interpretations are not always consistent in one jurisdiction, or across different
jurisdictions. Therefore, there is no assurance that our pending United States and foreign applications will issue, or what scope of protection any
issued patents will provide, or whether any such patents ultimately will be upheld as valid by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a
legal challenge. Interference proceedings, to determine priority of invention, also could arise in any of our pending patent applications. The costs of
such proceedings would be significant and an unfavorable outcome could result in the loss of rights to the invention at issue in the proceedings. If
we fail to obtain patents, there can be no assurance that we can protect our rights in the technology, or that others will not independently develop
substantially equivalent proprietary products and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our technology.
Competitors have filed applications for, or have been issued patents, and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products
or processes used in, necessary to, competitive with, or otherwise related to, our patents. The scope and validity of these patents, and the extent to
which we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents or under other proprietary rights and the cost and availability of licenses is
unknown. This may limit our ability to use and to license our technology. Litigation concerning these or other patents could be protracted and
expensive. If suit were brought against us for patent infringement, we could potentially challenge the validity of the other patent but would need to
overcome a presumption of validity. If we were found to infringe and the patent was held valid (or was unchallenged), there can be no assurance
that the prevailing party would grant us a license. Even if a license were available, the payments that would be required are unknown and could
materially reduce the value of our interest in the affected products.
8

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent
proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully
protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets.
We require our employees, directors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute
confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all
confidential information developed or made known to the individual through the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third
parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some consultants, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by
the individual while working for us will be our property. There is no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide sufficient protection
for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Government Contracts
A portion of our revenue in the Contract services segment consists of reimbursement of expenditures under U.S. government contracts. Our
revenue from government contracts was $969,626 and $750,160 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These
reimbursements represent all or a portion of the costs associated with such contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we have several government
contracts in process that have approximately $1,297,974 of revenue yet to be recognized. Government contracts are subject to delays and risk of
cancellation. Also, government contractors generally are subject to various kinds of audits and investigations by government agencies. These audits
and investigations involve review of a contractor’s performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing practices, the costs incurred and compliance
with all laws, regulations and standards. We have been audited by the government, with no material changes, and we do not expect the results of
any government audit to have a significant effect on our operations or our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and development activity is the driver for our new products and improvement of existing products. Research and development costs
incurred in the development of the Company’s products was $12,294 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Research and development costs were
$286,395 for 2017. This represented approximately 1.0% and 9.6% of our total operating costs in each of those years. The ability to engineer
product performance using nanotechnology is one of the ways we distinguish our products in marketing and sales of our products. Product
research and development work includes development and refinement of formulas, engineering of liquid formulas that can be applied both by hand
and by machine, optimization for a variety of performance characteristics, testing and characterization, and work on manufacturing processes and
techniques both for producing the product, and for a customer’s use of the product.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
Our operations must satisfy governmental safety standards. Applicable safety standards are established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (“OSHA”), pollution control standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other state and local regulations,
including foreign regulation for products manufactured or shipped outside the U.S. Some of our research work, and products developed may also
be subject to regulation under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(“CDRH”) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We take these requirements into account in product development. Cost of compliance with
these regulations has not been significant in the past and we do not expect it to be material in the future.
OSHA, the EPA, the CDRH and other governmental agencies, both in the United States, the states where we or our customers sell products, and
foreign countries, may adopt additional rules and regulations that may affect us and products using our technology. The cost of compliance with
these regulations has not been significant to us in the past and is not expected to be material in the future. Changing regulations can affect our
customers, and we have in the past, and may be required in the future, to reformulate or change packaging to address regulatory issues. This can
affect timing of sales which may be significant in an accounting period.
9

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 13 full-time employees. We do not anticipate the need to hire significant additional employees to support our
existing business. If product sales increase, or we begin to see commercial sales of new products, we may hire additional employees in sales and
marketing. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

10

As of September 10, 2019, the closing sale price for our Class A common stock as reported on the OTCQB system was $0.69 per share. As of that
date, there were approximately 346 shareholders of record for our Class A common stock. This does not include beneficial owners holding Class A
common stock in street name in brokerage accounts. As of our last record of total shareholders, including those holding stock in street name, there
were approximately 3,460 shareholders.
Cash Dividends
We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, have no plans to pay any dividends, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends in the
foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest future earnings, if any, to finance expansion of our business. Any payment of cash dividends in the
future will be dependent upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors determined by our board of directors.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
On February 28, 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,443 shares of Class A common stock and 2,962 shares of Class B common stock to
the Company’s directors as compensation to them for service on its board. These shares were valued on that date at $1.35 per share based on the
quoted price of the stock for a total value of $10,000. On that same day, the Company issued 6,746 shares of Class B common stock in satisfaction
of the outstanding equity credits.
On May 23, 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,043 shares of Class A common stock and 3,362 shares of Class B common stock to the
Company’s directors as compensation to them for service on its board. These shares were valued on that date at $1.19 per share based on the
quoted price of the stock for a total value of $10,000.
On October 15, 2018, we issued an aggregate of 20,000 shares of Class A common stock to the Company’s directors as compensation to them for
service on our board. These shares were valued on that date at $0.50 per share based on the price paid in the private placement for a total value of
$10,000. On that date 1,774 shares of Class A common stock were issued to fully retire the last outstanding equity credits.
On October 15, 2018, we sold 590,847 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $0.50 per share in a private placement for aggregate
proceeds of $295,423. Purchasers were PEN Comeback, LLC and Scott & Jeanne Rickert. Ronald Berman, one of our directors, and his son, Tom

(1)The Restricted Stock Agreement with Mr. Yaniv was approved by an advisory vote of the stockholders on August 22, 2014. Under the
Restricted Stock Agreement as adjusted for the reverse stock split that was effective in January 2016, he holds 37,778 shares of our Class A
common stock, subject to forfeiture (the “Forfeiture Restrictions”) which expire upon the first to occur of (i) a change in control of the
company, (ii) the death of Mr. Yaniv, or (iii) if more than 180 days after closing the average trading price of the shares during a
measurement period of ten consecutive trading days reaches certain price thresholds. At a $18 price, 5,554 shares vest, with additional
tranches of 5,556 shares vesting if the price reaches $27, $36, $45, and $54. The last 10,000 shares vest at a $63 price threshold. Because
the conditions for vesting were not met, the shares all forfeited on August 26, 2019.
(2)The 2002 Equity Compensation Plan was approved by a wide majority of the shareholders casting votes at each of the 2010, 2008, and 2007
annual meetings of shareholders. However, since less than 50% of the shares eligible to vote cast votes at each meeting, the plan does not
fall into the category of plans approved by shareholders under SEC rules. The 2002 Equity Compensation Plan expired in March 2012 and
no future options can be granted under the plan. In April 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors established the 2012 Equity Compensation
Plan. All options granted under both plans were priced at the fair market value of our common stock, or greater, on the date of grant and
have a life of up to ten (10) years from their date of grant, subject to earlier termination as set forth in the plan. Adjusted for the reverse
stock split that was effective January 26, 2016, a total of 27,778 options were authorized under the 2012 plan. The 2015 Equity Incentive
Plan was adopted by the Board on November 30, 2015. The Plan permits stock awards as well as option grants. Under this Plan we can
make stock grants or option grants. If awards expire unexercised, or restricted shares are forfeited, those shares are again available for
grant under the Plan. See the further description of this Plan in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)The PEN Brands LLC Stock Appreciation Rights Plan will, under certain circumstances, result in the issuance of shares of our common
stock. The number of rights that will be issued under that Plan will be determined at the time of our first registered offering based on the
price of the shares and therefore the number of shares to be issued is not calculable. See the description of that Plan in Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results
during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
OVERVIEW
PEN develops, commercializes and markets consumer and industrial products enabled by nanotechnology that solve everyday problems for
customers in the optical, transportation, military, sports and safety industries. Our primary business is the formulation, marketing and sale of
products enabled by nanotechnology including the ULTRA CLARITY brand eyeglass cleaner, CLARITY DEFOGIT brand defogging products and
CLARITY ULTRASEAL nanocoating products for glass and ceramics. We also sell an environmentally friendly surface protector, fortifier, and
cleaner. Our design center conducts development services for us and for government and private customers and develops and sells printable inks
and pastes, thermal management materials, and graphene foils and windows.
Our principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The products from which revenues are derived are consistent with
the reporting structure of the Company’s internal organization. The Company’s two reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2018
and for the 2017 period were (i) the Product segment and (ii) the Contract services segment.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes
and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes
to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
Revenues
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Revenues:
Product segment $ 3,048,164 $ 6,872,452
Contract services segment 1,282,588 1,005,647
Total segment and consolidated sales $ 4,330,752 $ 7,878,099
For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales from the Product segment decreased by $3,824,288, or 56%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017. This was primarily attributable to reduced sales volume of our optical cleaners and reduced volume of sales for anti-fog
products to our traditional customers and delays in putting our products into other channels. As noted above, several key customers of optical
cleaners stopped placing new orders in May, 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues of our Contract services segment increased by $276,941 or 28% as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017, due primarily to the start of several new research projects.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation,
overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred including costs related to government and private contracts in our Contract services segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of revenues decreased by $2,158,094, or 38%. These consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Cost of revenues:
Product segment $ 2,325,617 $ 4,513,318
Contract services segment 1,126,352 1,096,745
Total segment and consolidated cost of revenues $ 3,451,969 $ 5,610,063

Gross profit and gross margin
For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross profit amounted to $878,783 as compared to $2,268,036 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a
decrease of $1,389,253, or 61%. The decrease was due to significant reduction in sales volume and use of contract manufacturing that negatively
impacted margin. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, gross margins were 21.2% and 28.8%, respectively.
Gross profit and gross margin by segment and totals are as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
2018 % 2017 %
Gross profit:
Product segment * $ 722,547 23.7% $ 2,359,134 34.3%
Contract services segment * 156,236 12.2% (91,098) (9.1)%
Total gross profit $ 878,783 20.3% $ 2,268,036 28.8%
* Gross margin % based on respective segments sales.
Operating expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2018, operating expenses amounted to $1,197,281 as compared to $2,987,913 for the year ended December 31,
2017, a decrease of $1,790,632, or 60%. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating expenses consisted of the following:
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Selling and marketing expenses $ 36,891 $ 285,147
Salaries, wages and related benefits 102,116 957,954
Research and development 12,294 286,395
Professional fees 503,121 644,969
General and administrative expenses 542,859 813,448
Total $ 1,197,281 $ 2,987,913
● For the year ended December 31, 2018, selling and marketing expenses decreased by $248,256, or 87%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced commission payments.
● For the year ended December 31, 2018, salaries, wages and related benefits decreased by $855,838, or 89%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017. These decreases were attributable to personnel reductions related to our ongoing efforts to reduce costs as well as the
increased use of contract manufacturers who process our inventory at their facilities in the Product segment.
● For the year ended December 31, 2018, research and development costs decreased by $274,101, or 96%, as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2017. As part of our cost cutting, we discontinued work on any new product development.
● For the year ended December 31, 2018, professional fees decreased by $141,848, or 22%, as compared to the year ended December 31,
2017.
● For the year ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses decreased by $270,589, or 33%, as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2017. The decrease the year ended December 31, 2018 was attributable to several factors including the end of
amortization of intangibles, and personnel reductions with associated general and administrative expenses.
15

Loss from operations
As a result of the factors described above, for the year ended December 31, 2018, loss from operations amounted to $318,498 as compared to a loss
from operations of $719,877 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a difference of $401,379 or 56%.
Other income
For the year ended December 31, 2018, total other income amounted to $265,899 as compared to other income of $32,809 for the year ended
December 31, 2017, an increase of $233,090, or 710%. The increase in 2018 was due to the write-off of an account payable and certain related
accruals and the reversal of a portion of a litigation reserve which was settled for less than the amount reserved. In 2017 we recorded a loss on
settlement of $80,000 associated with a settlement agreement with a former employee as well as a net loss on the sale of property, plant and
equipment of $33,677 associated with the relocation of the Product segment operations.
Net loss
As a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2018, our net loss amounted to $53,135 as compared to a net loss of $687,068 for the
year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $633,933 or 92%.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net loss amounted to $(0.02) per common share (basic and diluted), and a net loss of $(0.22) per
common share (basic and diluted), respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working capital
deficit of $983,822 and unrestricted cash of $221,502 as of December 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018:
December 31, December 31, Dollar
2018 2017 Change Percentage Change
Working capital (deficit):
Total current assets $ 1,523,447 $ 1,751,382 $ (227,936) (13.01)%
Total current liabilities 2,507,268 3,096,477 (589,209) (19.03)%
Working capital (deficit): $ (983,822) $ (1,345,095) $ (361,274) (26.86)%
The change in working capital was in part because of a reduction in current assets when comparing December 31, 2017 with December 31, 2018.
The biggest part of that change was the decline in accounts receivable. Current liabilities decreased with a reduction in accrued expenses,
customer deposits and a reduction in the line of credit.
This working capital deficit raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or
raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Our principal future uses of cash are for working capital requirements, including sales and marketing
expenses, legal and other professional fees, capital expenditures and reduction of accrued liabilities. These uses will depend on numerous factors
including our sales and other revenues, and our ability to control costs. Recently, we have financed our working capital needs primarily through
internally generated funds, and bank loans. We collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms.
Over the past year we have reduced the scope of our operations to reduce our costs and enable us to operate without raising additional capital,
although there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be needed in future periods. We will continue to look for opportunities to raise
funds to permit us to increase the marketing of our products.
Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern and the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the
consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $155,889 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash provided in operating
activities of $438,558 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $282,669, or 64%.
● Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected a net loss of $53,135, partially offset by
the add-back of non-cash items totaling $251,109, and $(42,088) provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
● Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflected a net loss of $687,068, partially offset by the
add-back of non-cash items totaling $328,972, and $796,654 provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $(3,917) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of
$165,906 for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2017, the proceeds from sales of property and equipment exceeded the cost of equipment
purchases.
Net cash used by financing activities was $(78,769) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used by financing activities of
$560,293 for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid down $374,735 more than we received under
the line of credit and received $344,944 in net proceeds from the sale of securities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid down
$578,645 more than we received under the line of credit and repaid other debt in the amount of $96,648, partially offset by proceeds of $115,000
from advances from related parties.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
PEN Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PEN Inc. (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as
the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to
obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses, has a stockholders’ deficit and has a working capital
deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regard to these
matters are described in Note 1. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of:
Pen Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pen Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017, the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows, for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss and cash provided by operating activities of $687,068 and
$438,558, respectively, in 2017 and has a working capital deficit, stockholders’ deficit and accumulated deficit of $1,345,095, $1,096,005 and
$6,587,235, respectively, at December 31, 2017. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s Plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization
PEN Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “PEN” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, develops and sells a portfolio of nano-layer coatings, nano-based
cleaners, and nano-composite products based on its proprietary technology, and performs nanotechnology product research and development
generating revenues through performing contract services.
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PEN Brands LLC, formerly known as Nanofilm, Ltd., we develop, manufacture and sell consumer
and institutional products using nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. These
products are marketed internationally primarily to customers in the optical industry. On May 2, 2017, Nanofilm, Ltd. changed its name to PEN
Brands LLC.
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Applied Nanotech, Inc., we primarily perform design and development services for the Company
and for governmental and private customers.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Applied Nanotech, Inc and PEN
Brands LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had
a loss from operations and net cash provided by operations of $318,498 and $155,886, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Furthermore, the Company had an accumulated deficit, a stockholders’ deficit and a working capital deficit of $6,640,370, $753,396 and $983,821,
respectively, at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. Management cannot provide assurance that
the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations, become cash flow positive or raise additional capital. During 2017 and 2018,
management has taken measures to reduce operating expenses. Although the Company raised equity capital in 2018, there is no assurance that it
will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management
expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“US GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include
estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable, the estimates for obsolete inventory, the estimates for cooperative
advertising liability, the useful life of property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, estimates of current
and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, and the fair value of equity
incentives.
25

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
The Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of
fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows:
Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in
markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
data.
Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans and lines of credit,
accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other payables approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these
instruments.
The Company analyzes all financial and non-financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company accounts for three
instruments at fair value using level 3 valuation.
At December 31, 2018 At December 31, 2017
Description Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Stock appreciation rights Plan A - - $ - - - $ -
Equity credits issued - - $ - - - $ 2,278
A rollforward of the level 3 valuation of these three financial instruments is as follows:
Stock Appreciation
Rights Plan A Equity Credits Issued
Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 53,108 $ 2,278
Change in fair value included in net loss 1,430
Reclassification to cash liability (54,538)
Balance at December 31, 2017 $ - 2,278
Change in fair value included in net loss -
Reclassification to cash liability -
Balance at December 31, 2018 $ - $ 2,278
ASC 825-10 “Financial Instruments”, allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value
option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair
value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent
reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or
less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes $85,000 held in a collateral bank account by
a lender (see Note 6). The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-18 starting in 2017; its adoption did not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
26

Accounts Receivable
The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The
allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs, as well as an
assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the allowance for doubtful
accounts is recognized as general and administrative expense.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory,” (“ASU 2015-11”) which requires an entity to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying
the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or lease term including scheduled renewal terms.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in other income or expense in the year of disposition. The Company
examines the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value
may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference
between the asset’s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did not record any impairment charge for the year ended December 31,
2018 and 2017.
Revenue Recognition
For periods prior to January 1, 2018, Company recognized sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been provided, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We adopted ASC 606 effective
January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We concluded that no change was required in our accounting for any sources of revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2017, and therefore there was no cumulative effect adjustment required.
Types of revenue:
● Net product sales by our subsidiary PEN Brands LLC.
● Reimbursements under agreements to perform contract services related to new products and product development for government agencies
and others by our subsidiary, Applied Nanotech. We do not perform contracts that are contingent upon successful results. Larger projects
are sometimes broken down in phases to allow the customer to determine at the end of each phase if they wish to move to the next phase.
The agreements with federal government agencies generally provide that, upon completion of a technology development program, the
funding agency is granted a royalty-free license to use any technology developed during the course of the program for its own purposes, but
not any preexisting technology that we use in connection with the program. We retain all other rights to use, develop, and commercialize
the technology. Agreements with nongovernmental entities generally allow the entity the first opportunity to license the technology from us
upon completion of the project.
● Product sales and other miscellaneous revenues from our subsidiary, Applied Nanotech such as the sale of conductive inks, graphene foils
and thermal management materials.
27

Revenue recognition criteria:
● Net product sales by our subsidiary PEN Brands LLC, are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred.
● Revenue from contract services is generally recognized based on what we have a right to invoice.
● Revenue from other product sales is recognized at the time the product shipped. The Company’s subsidiary Applied Nanotech’s primary
business is contract services, not the sale of products. Product sales are generally insignificant in number, and are generally limited to the
sale of conductive inks, graphene foils, thermal management materials, samples, proofs of concepts, prototypes, or other items resulting
from its contract services.
● Other miscellaneous revenue is recognized as deemed appropriate given the facts of the situation and is generally not material.
Sales Incentives and Consideration Paid to Customers
The Company accounts for certain promotional costs such as sales incentives and cooperative advertising as a reduction of sales. For the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded approximately $0 and $108,303 respectively, as a reduction of sales related to these
costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, based on industry trends related to cooperative advertising management recorded a one-time
adjustment to reduce its cooperative advertising liability by approximately $446,000 to $0 as of December 31, 2017 with a corresponding $446,000
increase to product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation, overhead
and shipping and handling costs incurred.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs incurred relating to the purchase of inventory are included in inventory which is charged to cost of sales as product
are sold. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipped to customers are included in cost of sales. For the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017 shipping and handling costs amounted to $110,761 and $185,762, respectively.
Research and Development
Research and development costs incurred in the development of the Company’s products and under other Company sponsored research and
development projects are expensed as incurred. Costs such as direct labor, direct costs, and other allocated costs incurred to perform research and
development service pursuant to government and private research projects are in included in cost of sales. Research and development costs
incurred in the development of the Company’s products for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $12,294 and $286,395,
respectively, and are included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Advertising Costs
The Company participates in various advertising programs. All costs related to advertising of the Company’s products are expensed in the period
incurred. Advertising costs charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $779 and $14,626, respectively, and are
included in selling and marketing on the consolidated accompanying statements of operations. These advertising expenses do not include
cooperative advertising and sales incentives which have been deducted from sales.
28

Federal and State Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income tax using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740, “Income Taxes”. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates
that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax
assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. Using that
guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon
examination by the tax authorities. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements. Tax years that remain subject to examination are the years ending on and after December 31, 2014. The
Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. However, no such interest and penalties were
recorded as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the Act), was signed into law. The Act includes a number of changes in
existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent change in the corporate income tax rate to a fixed rate of 21%.
The new rate took effect on January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred taxes at December 31, 2017.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in
the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the
employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires
measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We
adopted ASU No. 2016-09 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-09 in 2018; its adoption did not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
“measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of
compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the
reporting date.
Loss Per Share of Common Stock
ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share”, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) with a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. Basic net loss per common share is
computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock,
common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, 37,778
contingently issuable common shares that are issuable based on certain market conditions (see Note 9) are not included in the potential dilutive
shares in calculating the diluted EPS. Additionally, potentially dilutive common shares consist of common stock options and warrants (using the
treasury stock method).
29

These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. Potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted
shares outstanding as they would have an anti-dilutive impact on the Company’s net losses and consisted of the following:
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
Stock options 8,726 19,120
Stock warrants 551,559 712
Restricted stock 37,778 37,778
Warrant Options 550,847
Total 1.148,910 57,610
Additionally, there are an unknown quantity of common stock equivalents that result from a potential conversion of equity credits and stock
appreciation rights (See Notes 13 and 14).
Net loss per share for each class of common stock is as follows:
Year Ended Year Ended
Net loss per common shares outstanding: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
Class A common stock $ (0.02) $ (0.24)
Class B common stock $ - $ (0.22)
Class Z common stock $ - $ -
Weighted average shares outstanding:
Class A common stock 3,741,481 1,539,810
Class B common stock - 1,414,349
Class Z common stock - 102,894
Total weighted average shares outstanding 3,741,481 3,057,053
Segment Reporting
The Company uses “the management approach” in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal
organization and reporting used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source for determining the Company’s reportable segments. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the President of the Company, who
reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company classified
the reportable operating segments into (i) the development, manufacture and sale of consumer and institutional products using nanotechnology to
deliver unique performance attributes at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates (the “Product segment”) and (ii) nanotechnology design and
development services for our future products and for government and private entities and sales of products developed for third parties (the
“Contract services segment”).
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”) to amend the accounting guidance for leases. The accounting applied by
a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02. However, the standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases
classified as operating leases on the balance sheet. Lessees will recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments
and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is
permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this
election, it will recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on its
consolidated financial statements and notes to its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, “Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Down Round Features,” (“ASU 2017-11”). Equity-linked instruments, such as warrants and convertible instruments may
contain down round features that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Under ASU 2017-11,
a down round feature will no longer require a freestanding equity-linked instrument (or embedded conversion option) to be classified as a liability
that is remeasured at fair value through the income statement (i.e. marked-to-market). However, other features of the equity-linked instrument (or
embedded conversion option) must still be evaluated to determine whether liability or equity classification is appropriate. Equity classified
instruments are not marked-to-market. For earnings per share (“EPS”) reporting, the ASU requires companies to recognize the effect of the down
round feature only when it is triggered by treating it as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common shareholders in basic EPS.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this
new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
There are no other recently issued accounting standards that apply to us or that are expected to have a material impact on our results of
operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
Reclassifications
Certain accounts and financial statement captions in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statements.
None of the reclassifications had any impact on the net loss reported in 2017.

NOTE 6 – BANK LOANS AND LINES OF REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
In April 2014, our subsidiary, PEN Brands LLC entered into a $1,500,000 revolving credit line agreement (the “Revolving Note”) with Mackinac
Commercial Credit, LLC (the “Lender”) with draws limited to a borrowing base as defined in the Revolving Note. The unpaid principal balance of
this Revolving Note is payable on demand, is secured by all of PEN Brands LLC’s assets, and bears interest computed at a rate of interest (the
“Effective Rate”) which is equal to 7.0% above the LIBOR Rate, as defined, payable monthly. PEN Brands LLC will pay to Lender a late charge of
5.0% of any monthly payment not received by Lender within 10 calendar days after its due date. The Company may, at any time or from time to
time upon three business days’ written notice to Lender, prepay the Note in whole provided that if (i) Borrower prepays the Revolving Note in full
and terminates the Revolving Note, or (ii) Lender terminates the Revolving Note after default, then Borrower will pay a termination premium equal
to 2.0% of the maximum loan amount. On May 1, 2015, PEN Brands LLC and the Lender entered into an amendment to the Loan and Security
Agreement extending the outside maturity date to April 4, 2016 and permitting advances against an expanded borrowing base. The borrowing base
was increased by $450,000 through October 31, 2015, with this amount reducing by $7,500 monthly thereafter. In addition, PEN Inc., the parent
company, guaranteed PEN Brands LLC’s obligations to the Lender. On April 4, 2016, the maturity date under the Loan & Security Agreement
between PEN Brands LLC and the Lender was automatically extended for a one-year renewal term.
Without the Lender’s consent, so long as the obligation remains outstanding, in addition to other covenants as defined in the Revolving Note, PEN
Brands LLC shall not a) merge or consolidate with any other company, except for the combination that closed in August 2014 and shall not suffer a
change of control; b) make any capital expenditures, as defined, materially affecting the business; c) declare or pay cash dividends upon any of its
stock, or distribute any of its property, make any loans, make investments, redeem, retire or acquire any of its stock, d) become liable for the
indebtedness of anyone else, as defined, and e) incur indebtedness, other than trade payables.
On April 3, 2017, PEN Brands LLC and the Lender executed a second amendment to the Revolving Note that extended the maturity date to April 4,
2018, with a one-year renewal option. The second amendment also changed the interest rate to 3.0% above the Prime Rate, as reported in the Wall
Street Journal. Under a subsequent amendment, the maturity date was changed to July 3, 2018.
On October 17, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Note, the gross proceeds of $85,000 in connection with the Asset Purchase agreement
were applied to decrease the borrowing base of the Revolving Note. In connection with the sale of fixed assets, the Company amended the
Revolving Note to establish a cash collateral account to be no less than $85,000. Pursuant to this amendment, the Company entered into a loan
agreement with two Company directors in the aggregate principal amount of $85,000 in order to fund the cash collateral provision pursuant to the
amended loan agreement.
On March 30, 2018, PEN Brands and the lender entered into the fourth amendment that permits the borrower to request up to three advances of
not more than $200,000 each supported by certain qualifying purchase orders. Each purchase order advance to be repaid in not less than 30 days.
No subsequent request can be made until any prior purchase order advance has been repaid. Two of the Company’s officers and directors have
personally guaranteed repayment of purchase order advances. The fourth amendment also changes the maturity date for the loan to July 3, 2018.
That date becomes the date for an automatic one-year renewal unless either the lender or the borrower gives notice of non-renewal. Other terms
and conditions of the agreement remain the same.
On August 8, 2018, PEN Brands and the lender entered into the fifth amendment with an effective date of July 3, 2018. The fifth amendment
renewed the agreement through July 3, 2019 and provides for an automatic one-year renewal at that time unless it is terminated by either party 60
days in advance. The fifth amendment also limits the amounts that PEN Brands can advance to its parent, and provides that advances based on
eligible inventory will reduce monthly by $7,500 per month starting November 1, 2018.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company had a line of credit balance outstanding of $330,892 and $563,218, respectively, which includes
accrued interest of $2,475 and $14,797, respectively. Advances are less than the amount of the credit line and are limited by the borrowing base at
the time of the request for the advance. Subject to the limitations of the borrowing base, the amount available on the line of credit was $1,176,440
at December 31, 2018. The weighted average interest rate during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 7.9% and 5.5%,

Any shares that have not vested five years after the effective date will be forfeited. The Company also entered into a Piggyback Registration Rights
Agreement that will allow Dr. Yaniv, subject to other customary terms and conditions, to register shares that are no longer subject to forfeiture if
the Company is registering its shares. Pursuant to ASC 718-10 and related subsections, these shares were valued on the date of grant of August 27,
2014 at $13.12 per share for a total value of $495,720. The Company estimates the fair value of the awards with market conditions using a
Binomial simulation, which utilizes several assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the volatility of the Company’s stock and the exercise
behavior of award recipients. The grant-date fair value of $495,720 of the awards will be recognized over the requisite service period of 3 years,
which represents the derived service period for the stock grant as determined by the Binomial simulation method. For the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017, in connection with the amortization of the fair value of this stock grant, the Company recorded stock-based compensation of $0
and $110,160 respectively, At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no unamortized stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in
future periods. See Note 16 – Subsequent Events for information about the forfeiture of these shares.
Conversion of Class Z Common Stock
On May 23, 2017, Zeiss converted 262,631 shares of Class Z common stock into 262,631 shares of Class A common stock. Immediately thereafter,
Zeiss sold 262,631 shares of Class A common stock to certain buyers which included the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for an aggregate of
$100,000. In addition, pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, Zeiss’ Board representation automatically terminated and, as a result, Zeiss
ceased to be a related party as of May 23, 2017.
Conversion of Class B Common Stock
On or about October 15, 2018 as part of the terms for the stock sale to PEN Comeback, Scott and Jeanne Rickert and their family partnership
exercised the right to convert Class B shares into Class A shares on a 1:1 basis resulting in the issuance of 1,436,052 shares of Class A common
stock.
2015 Equity Incentive Plan
On November 30, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), which reserved 111,111 shares of common
stock. If any share of common stock that has been granted pursuant to a stock option ceases to be subject to a stock option, or if any forfeiture or
termination affects shares of common stock that are the subject to any other stock-based award, the shares are again available for future grants
and awards under the Plan. The Plan’s purpose is to enable the Company to offer its employees, officers, directors and consultants an opportunity
to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company for their contributions. As of December 31, 2017, 17,284 Class A common shares and options to
purchase up to 10,000 Class A common shares were issued under the Plan. As of December 31, 2018, the options had been forfeited and 93,827
shares are available for future issuance.

NOTE 10 – INCOME TAXES
The Company maintains deferred tax assets and liabilities that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset
by a valuation allowance because of the uncertainty of the attainment of future taxable income.
The items accounting for the difference between income taxes at the effective statutory rate and the provision for income taxes for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:
Years Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Income tax benefit at U.S. statutory rate of 21% (2018) and 34% (2017) $ (11,000) $ (234,000)
Non-deductible expenses - 5,000
Other (9,000)
Change in valuation allowance (20,000) (1,159,000)
Revaluation of deferred tax assets under U.S. tax act - 1,388,000
Total provision for income tax $ - $ -
The Company’s approximate net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
Deferred Tax Assets:
Net operating loss carryforward $ 2,027,000 $ 1,988,000
Stock-based compensation 93,000 93,000
Allowance for inventory obsolescence 85,000 56,000
Accrued compensation 28,000 73,000
Other 32,000 35,000
Total deferred tax assets 2,265,000 2,245,000
Valuation allowance (2,265,000) (2,245,000)
Net deferred tax assets $ - -
The estimated net operating loss carryforward was approximately $9,651,000 at December 31, 2018, which is an estimate of the Company’s net
operating loss carryforward acquired in the Combination after giving effect to the limitation on the usage of such net operating loss carryforwards
due to a change in ownership in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code plus net operating loss carryforwards since the
Combination. The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred income tax asset for the year ended December 31, 2018
because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carryforward. The potential tax benefit arising from tax
loss carryforwards will expire between 2019 and 2037.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the Act), was signed into law. The Act includes a number of changes in
existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent change in the corporate income tax rate to a fixed rate of 21%.
The new rate took effect on January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its deferred taxes at December 31, 2017.
In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the usage of the Company’s net operating loss carry forwards are subject to annual
limitations due to greater than 50% ownership changes. Additionally, the future utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards to offset future
taxable income may be subject to special tax rules which may limit their usage under the Separate Return Limitation Year (“SRLY”) rules. If
necessary, the deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforward that expires prior to utilization as a result of such limitations, with a
corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.
The Company’s 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 Corporate Income Tax Returns are subject to Internal Revenue Service examination.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINCENGIES
Leases
The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Rent expense for operating leases was $335,004
and $529,723 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, including $0 and $5,346 of amortization for deferred lease incentives
for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
On September 20, 2017, the Company entered into a three-year lease agreement for 22,172 square feet of office space in Brooklyn Heights, Ohio
beginning September 20, 2017 and ending September 20, 2020. Monthly lease payments amount to $8,688 for a total of approximately $312,768
for the total term of the lease.
On December 10, 2018, we entered into a five-year lease agreement for 3,742 square feet of space for the design facility in Austin, beginning
January 2019 and ending February 29, 2024. Monthly lease payments start at $3,472 per month, increasing 3% each year for a total of
approximately $238,440 over the term of the lease.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases at December 31, 2018 are as follows:
Years ending December 31, Amount
2019 $ 202,443
2020 155,605
2021 73,345
2022 69,640
2023 70,626
Total minimum non-cancelable operating lease payments $ 571,659
Litigation
The Company may be, from time to time, subject to various administrative, regulatory, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. We are not currently a defendant in any proceedings. Our policy is to accrue costs for contingent liabilities, including legal proceedings or
unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings, when a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December
31, 2017, we had $85,000 accrued related to a settlement. In December 2018, under a superceding agreement, we made a lump sum payment of
$24,000 to the other party in full and final settlement of all obligations and reversed the balance of the accrual. As of December 31, 2018, the
Company has not accrued any amount for litigation contingencies.
NOTE 12 – CONCENTRATIONS
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and cash
deposits and investments in cash equivalent instruments.
Lender Concentration
The Company relies primarily on one lender under a $1,500,000 Revolving Note (See Note 6).
Customer Concentrations
Customer concentrations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
Revenues
For the Years Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Customer A 30% 27%
Customer B *% 12%
Total 30% 39%

Customer A 25% 30%
Customer B *% 21%
Customer C 23 *%
Customer D 17 *%
Total 65% 51%
*Less than 10%
A reduction in sales from or loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.
Geographic Concentrations of Sales
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total sales in the United States represent approximately 93% and 74% of total consolidated
revenues, respectively. No other geographical area accounting for more than 10% of total sales during the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2017.
Vendor Concentrations
Vendor concentrations for inventory purchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are:

Vendor B 21% 10%
Vendor C 10% 10%
Vendor D *% 14%
Total 54% 60%
*Less than 10%
NOTE 13 – EQUITY CREDITS
In 1997, PEN Brands LLC established The Equity Credit Incentive Program. This program enabled select employees the opportunity to purchase
equity credits that increase in value based upon an increase in PEN Brands LLC’s revenue over a base year of 1996. Eligible credits can be
redeemed after two years at the equity credit value for that year. Under certain circumstances, the equity credits are convertible into PEN Brands
LLC equity on a one-for-one basis. During the year ended December 31, 2017, no equity credits were forfeited and no units were redeemed. The
8,250 equity credits outstanding were all held by our CEO and had a redemption value of $2,278 at December 31, 2017. In 2018 shares were issued
to convert the remaining equity credits into equity. As of December 31, 2018, no equity credits were issued and outstanding.
NOTE 14 – STOCK APPRECIATION PLAN
From June 1, 1988, until December 31, 1997, when the plan was terminated, PEN Brands LLC had in place a Stock Appreciation Rights Plan A (the
“Plan”), intended to provide employees, directors, members of a technical advisory board and certain independent contractors selected by the
Board with equity-like participation in the growth of PEN Brands LLC. The maximum number of stock appreciation rights that could be granted by
the Board was 1,000,000. There were 235,782 fully vested stock appreciation rights (“SARS”) outstanding under the terms of the Plan at December
31, 2018 and 2017.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company accrued $54,290 and $54,538, respectively, related to the cash redemption value associated with
the stock appreciation rights held by terminated employees.

NOTE 15 – SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company’s principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The products from which revenues are derived are
consistent with the reporting structure of the Company’s internal organization. The Company’s two reportable segments for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017 were the Product segment and ii) the Contract services segment (formerly the research and development segment).
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon the Company’s management
organization structure as of December 31, 2018 and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may
result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. There are no inter-segment revenue transactions and, therefore, revenues are only to
external customers. As the Company primarily generates its revenues from customers in the United States, no geographical segments are
presented.
Segment operating profit is determined based upon internal performance measures used by the chief operating decision-maker. The Company
derives the segment results from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies the Company uses to derive reportable
segment results are the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment
based upon several metrics, including net revenues, gross profit and operating loss. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of,
and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments. The Company manages certain operating expenses separately at the corporate level
and does not allocate such expenses to the segments. Segment income from operations excludes interest income/expense and other income or
expenses and income taxes according to how a particular reportable segment’s management is measured. Management does not consider
impairment charges, and unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.
Segment information available with respect to these reportable business segments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as
follows:
For the Years Ended December 31,

Item 9. Changes and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.
At the request of the Board of directors, we initiated a competitive process to select an independent accounting firm. The results of that process
were reviewed with the Board on December 5, 2018, and the Audit Committee was empowered to make the final selection. On December 7, 2018
the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Tama Budaj Raab. On that day we informed Salberg & Company, P.A. (“Salberg & Co”) that it
was being dismissed as our independent, registered public accounting firm.
The reports of Salberg & Co on our consolidated financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December
31, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainly, audit scope or
accounting principles except that Salberg & Co’s reports for both years included a paragraph indicating there was substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern.
During our two most recent fiscal years referred to above and during the subsequent interim reporting periods through December 7, 2018, there
were (1) no disagreements with Salberg & Co on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing
scope or procedures which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Salberg & Co would have caused Salberg & Co to make reference to
the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports, and (2) no events of the type listed in paragraphs (A) through (D) of Item
301(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
During our two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and during the subsequent interim reporting periods
through December 7, 2018, neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf has consulted Tama Budaj Raab with respect to (i) the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either contemplated or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our
consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report was provided by us nor oral advice was provided to us that Tama Budaj Raab
concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or any matter
that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation SK and the related instructions) or a reportable event
(as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation SK).
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not
absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
43

As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the
material weaknesses described below.
To address these material weaknesses, management engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure
that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) for the
Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The framework
used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that, during
the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018 and that material weaknesses
in ICFR existed as more fully described below.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(“PCAOB”) Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has
identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2018 our internal controls over
financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:
1. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company’s ability to gather, analyze and properly review
information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties
may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody
of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated our limited resources and
our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control
deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.
2. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely
basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely
communication between non–financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and
has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.
44

We have taken steps to remediate the weaknesses described above, including by expanding the responsibilities of our more experienced accounting
personnel. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit.
Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there are material weaknesses as identified herein, we believe that our
consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
years covered thereby in all material respects.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm as we are a smaller
reporting company and are not required to provide the report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our internal control over financial reporting has not changed during the fourth quarter covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as
discussed above.
Item 9B. Other Information.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us under Rule 16a-3(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and Forms 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018, as well as any written representation from a reporting person that no Form 5 is required, we are not aware that any officer,
director or 10% or greater shareholder failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the aforementioned Forms, reports required by Section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our executive officers and other employees. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be sent, free of
charge, to any person who sends a written request for a copy to Jeanne Rickert, Secretary, PEN Inc., 701 Brickell Avenue, Suite 1550, Miami,
Florida 33131.
Board Leadership Structure and Board’s Role in Risk Oversight
Our Chief Executive Officer also serves as the Chairman of our board of directors and we have not designated any of our independent directors as a
“lead director.” Our board of directors believes that by combining the role of Chairman with the Chief Executive Officer, the Company will unify
under one vision to better focus its limited resources. Because of his background, our Chairman brings to the Board and to the task a perspective
that combines the operational experience of a member of management with the oversight focus of a member of the Board.
Risk is inherent within every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a variety of risks,
including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-
day management of the risks we face, while the Board has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. Taking its risk oversight role, the
Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are
adequate and functioning as designed. To do this, our directors meet regularly with management to discuss strategy and risks we face.
Board Committees and Director Independence
Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that requires a majority of our Board members to be independent and we are not currently otherwise
subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our Board of Directors include “independent” directors, nor are we
required to establish or maintain an Audit Committee or other committee of our Board of Directors. Our board has determined that Messrs. Holmes
and Westerman are “independent” as defined by the NASDAQ Marketplace rules.
The Board does not have standing compensation or nominating committees. The Board does not believe these committees are necessary based on
the size of our company and the current levels of compensation to corporate officers. We will consider establishing compensation and nominating
committees at the appropriate time.
47

The entire Board of Directors participates in the consideration of compensation issues relating to the Chairman. Candidates for director nominees
are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board and the operating and strategic challenges that we face in the next few years.
In conducting this assessment, we consider skills, diversity, age, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the
Board and our company, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. The process for identifying and evaluating nominees for
director, including nominees recommended by stockholders, will involve compiling names of potentially eligible candidates, conducting background
and reference checks, conducting interviews with the candidate and others (as schedules permit), We will seek out individuals with relevant
experience to provide strategic guidance and to advise management as we operate our business and introduce new products.
Audit Committee
In February 2016, the Board created an audit committee. It is charged with overseeing (1) the integrity of our financial statements and accounting
and financial reporting processes; (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the performance of our independent auditor and
the qualifications and independence of that firm; (4) our system of disclosure, internal controls and compliance with our Code of Conduct. Howard
Westerman is the sole director on the audit committee. He is not an audit committee financial expert.
Report of the Audit Committee
The audit committee (the “Committee”) oversees the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has
the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including internal control systems. The Company’s independent
registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the company’s audited financial statements with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including discussions of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of
significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
In addition, the Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard No. 16 “Communications with audit Committees.” The Committee met with the
independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of that firm’s examinations and the
overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting. In addition, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with management management’s
report on internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the
applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered accounting firm’s
communications with the Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered accounting firm the
independence of that firm.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions described in this report, the Committee recommends to the Board of the Directors (and the Board has
approved) the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed
with the SEC.
Stockholder Nominations
To nominate candidates for service as a director on our board a stockholder must hold at least $2,000 in value of shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors. Notice must be given not less than 60 or more than 90 days before the meeting. If less than 75-days’ notice is given of the date
of the meeting, the stockholder’s notice is due not more than 10 days after notice of the meeting is given or after public disclosure of the date of the
meeting, whichever is first. The notice must include information about a proposed candidate: the class and number of shares of stock held of
record, owned beneficially and represented by proxy by the nominating shareholder or any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by,
under common control with or acting in concert with the nominating shareholder (which we refer to as a “shareholder associated person”), and by
each person to be nominated such information to be as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date of such notice; a description of all
contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships between (a) the shareholder making the nomination and any shareholder associated
person that relate to the nomination, (b) the shareholder making the nomination and the proposed nominee and (c) the shareholder making the
nomination, the proposed nominee or any shareholder associated person and any other person or persons that relate to the nomination.

We sometimes refer to these individuals to as the “named executive officers” as that term is defined under Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act

received compensation in the form of Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation or Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings in fiscal 2018 and
fiscal 2017. The value of stock awards represents the grant date fair value of awards granted with respect to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 in
accordance with ASC Topic 718. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated
forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. Our methodology, including its underlying estimates and assumptions used in calculating
these values, is set forth in Note 2 to our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
For stock awards, these shares were valued on the grant date based on the quoted trading price of the stock on such date. We did not grant any
stock options to named executive officers in 2018 or 2017.
