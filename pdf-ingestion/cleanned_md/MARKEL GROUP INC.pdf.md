PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
Markel Group Inc. (Markel Group) is a holding company comprised of a diverse family of businesses and investments. The leadership teams of our
businesses operate with a high degree of independence, while at the same time living the values that we call the Markel Style. Our specialty
insurance business, Markel, sits at the core of our company. Through decades of sound underwriting, Markel has provided the capital base from
which we built a system of businesses and investments that collectively increase Markel Group's durability and adaptability. We aspire to build one of
the world's great companies by creating win-win-win outcomes for our customers, associates and shareholders. We deploy three financial engines in
pursuit of this goal.
Insurance - markets and underwrites specialty insurance products using our underwriting, fronting and insurance-linked securities platforms
that enable us to best match risk and capital
Investments - invests premiums received by our underwriting operations and any available earnings provided by our operating businesses in
fixed maturity and equity securities
Markel Ventures - owns controlling interests in a diverse portfolio of businesses that operate in a variety of industries
Our three interdependent engines form a system that provides diverse income streams, access to a wide range of investment opportunities and the
ability to efficiently move capital to the best ideas across our three engines. We allocate capital using a process that we have consistently followed
for years. We first look to invest in our existing businesses for organic growth opportunities. After funding internal growth opportunities, we look to
acquire controlling interests in businesses, build our portfolio of equity securities, or repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe our system
is uniquely equipped for long-term growth. To mitigate the effects of short-term volatility and align with the long-term perspective that we apply to
operating our businesses and making investments, we generally use five-year time periods to measure our performance. We measure financial
success by our ability to grow the market price per common share of our stock, or total shareholder return, at high rates of return over a long period
of time. Over the past five years, our common share price increased at a compound annual rate of 6%. We also have considered the performance of
book value per common share over the long-term, although we believe that as our business has evolved, this measure has become less reflective of
shareholder value because a significant portion of our operations is not recorded at fair value. Over the past five years, the compound annual growth
in book value per common share was 11%.
The following graph presents stock price per common share and book value per common share for the past five years as of December 31.

Insurance
Our insurance engine is comprised of the following types of operations:
• Underwriting - our risk-bearing insurance and reinsurance operations.
• Program services and other fronting - fronting platform that provides other insurance entities and capacity providers access to the United
States (U.S.) property and casualty insurance market.
• Insurance-linked securities (ILS) - provides investment management services to third-party capital providers for a variety of insurance-related
investment products.
Through our underwriting, program services and other fronting and ILS operations, we have a suite of capabilities through which we can access
capital to support our customers' risks, which includes our own capital through our underwriting operations, as well as third-party capital through our
program services and other fronting and ILS operations. Within each of these insurance platforms, we believe that our specialty product focus
enables us to develop expertise and specialized market knowledge. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors by our expertise, service,
continuity and other value-based considerations, including the multiple platforms through which we can manage risk and deploy capital. For example,
through our program services and other fronting platform, we have programs through which we write insurance policies on behalf of our ILS
operations that are supported by third-party capital. Additionally, we cede certain risks historically written through our underwriting operations to our
ILS operations to the extent those risks are more aligned with the risk profile of our ILS investors than our own corporate tolerance. Our ability to
access multiple insurance platforms allows us to achieve income
10K - 3

streams from our insurance operations beyond the traditional underwriting model. We believe this multi-platform approach provides us with a unique
advantage through which we have the ability to unlock additional value for our customers and business partners, which we refer to as "the power of
the platform."
Underwriting
Specialty Insurance and Reinsurance
Within our underwriting operations, we underwrite specialty insurance products on a risk-bearing basis. The specialty insurance market differs
significantly from the standard market. In the standard market, insurance rates and forms are highly regulated, products and coverages are largely
uniform with relatively predictable exposures, and companies tend to compete for customers on the basis of price. In contrast, the specialty market
provides coverage for hard-to-place risks that generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard carriers.
Competition in the specialty insurance market tends to focus less on price than in the standard insurance market and more on other value-based
considerations, such as availability, service and expertise. While specialty market exposures may have higher perceived insurance risks than their
standard market counterparts, we seek to manage these risks and achieve higher financial returns. To reach our financial and operational goals, we
must have extensive knowledge and expertise in our chosen markets. Many of our larger accounts are considered on an individual basis where
customized forms and tailored solutions are employed. Examples of specialty insurance markets that we have targeted include liability coverage for
highly specialized professionals, transaction-related risks, and marine, energy and environmental-related activities. Our market strategy in each of
these areas of specialization is tailored to the unique nature of the loss exposure, coverage and services required by insureds. In each of the markets
we serve, we assign teams of experienced underwriters and claims specialists who provide a full range of insurance services.
We also participate in the reinsurance market in certain classes of reinsurance product offerings, primarily casualty lines and certain other specialty
lines. In the reinsurance market, our clients are other insurance companies, or cedents. We typically write our reinsurance products in the form of
treaty reinsurance contracts, which are contractual arrangements that provide for automatic reinsuring of a type or category of risk underwritten by
cedents. Treaty reinsurance products are written globally on both a quota share and excess of loss basis. With treaty reinsurance contracts, we do
not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under the contracts and are largely dependent on the individual underwriting decisions
made by the cedent. Accordingly, we review and analyze the cedent's risk management and underwriting practices in deciding whether to provide
treaty reinsurance and in pricing of treaty reinsurance contracts. Additionally, we write casualty reinsurance on a facultative basis, which is distinct
from treaty reinsurance in that we evaluate each risk individually to determine whether to assume the risk.
The following chart presents the composition of our underwriting operations between our Insurance segment and Reinsurance segment based on
2023 underwriting gross premium volume of $10.3 billion. The Insurance segment includes all of our direct business, as well as facultative
reinsurance placements. The Reinsurance segment includes all treaty reinsurance.

Markets and Distribution
Our underwriting operations write business on a global basis and utilize multiple distribution channels to access our targeted risks.
In the U.S., we write business in the excess and surplus lines (E&S) and admitted insurance markets, as well as the reinsurance market. The primary
distribution channels through which our U.S. business is placed are wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers, retail insurance agents and
alternative channels, including third-party managing general agents.
The E&S, or non-admitted, market focuses on hard-to-place risks and loss exposures that generally are not written in the standard market. E&S
eligibility allows our insurance subsidiaries to underwrite unique loss exposures with more flexible policy forms and unregulated premium rates. This
typically results in coverages that are more restrictive and more expensive than coverages in the standard market. The E&S market is accessed
primarily through wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers, which have limited quoting and binding authority. In 2022, the E&S market
represented $98 billion, or 11%, of the $875 billion U.S. property and casualty industry.1 In 2022, we were the third largest E&S writer in the U.S. as
measured by direct premium writings.1
Our U.S. business written in the admitted market focuses on unique and hard-to-place risks in the standard market, some of which must remain with
an admitted insurance company for marketing and regulatory reasons. Hard-to-place risks written in the admitted market cover insureds engaged in
similar, but highly specialized, activities that require a total insurance program not otherwise available from standard insurers. The admitted market
is subject to more state regulation than the E&S market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, premium tax payment
requirements and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. Business written in the admitted
market is placed primarily by retail insurance agents. Our admitted business is also placed through managing general agents, which have broader
underwriting authority than retail agents. These agents are carefully selected based on a track record of proficiency with their selected products, and
the business written is controlled through regular audits and pre-approvals. In addition, certain products and programs written on an admitted basis
are marketed directly to consumers.

Our U.S. reinsurance operations are conducted through MGRC. Reinsurance business is placed primarily through wholesale reinsurance brokers. We
were the 41st largest reinsurer in 2022 as measured by worldwide gross reinsurance premium writings.2
In Bermuda, which is known for its significant concentration of insurance and reinsurance businesses, we participate in the worldwide insurance and
reinsurance markets. The Bermuda property and casualty market is a significant source of capital for the U.S. market and the leading location for
cessions by U.S. insurers.3 Business written in the Bermuda market is typically placed by a Bermuda-based wholesale broker. We conduct our
Bermuda underwriting operations through MBL, which is registered as a Class 4 insurer and Class C long-term insurer under the insurance laws of
Bermuda.
We also participate in the London insurance and reinsurance market, which is known for its ability to provide innovative, tailored coverage and
capacity for unique and hard-to-place risks, many of which have significantly higher limits than risks placed through the standard market. Insurance
brokers place most of the business in the London market. Risks written in this market are written on either a direct basis or a subscription basis, the
latter of which means that loss exposures brought into the market are typically insured by more than one insurance company or Lloyd's of London
(Lloyd's) syndicate, often due to the high limits of insurance coverage required. We participate in the London insurance and reinsurance market
primarily through Markel Capital Limited (Markel Capital) and MIICL. Markel Capital is the corporate capital provider for Syndicate 3000, through
which our Lloyd's operations are conducted. In addition to their headquarters in London, Markel Capital and MIICL maintain branch offices across the
United Kingdom (U.K.), Europe, Canada, Asia, Australia and the Middle East through which we are able to offer insurance and reinsurance.
In Europe, we also write business through Syndicate 3000 and MISE, a regulated insurance carrier located in Munich, Germany. From its offices in
Germany, MISE transacts business in European Union (E.U.) member states and throughout the European Economic Area. MISE has established
branches in Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, France and the U.K. Syndicate 3000 supplements, or serves as an alternative to, MISE for
access to the E.U. markets.
While we operate in various other markets, substantially all of our gross written premiums in 2023 were written from our platforms in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Bermuda and Germany. In 2023, 80% of gross premium writings from our global underwriting operations were attributed
to risks or cedents located in the United States. In each of the markets in which we operate, we seek to develop and capitalize on relationships with
insurance and reinsurance brokers, insurance and reinsurance companies, large global corporations and financial intermediaries to develop and
underwrite business. A significant volume of premium for the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry is produced through a small
number of large insurance and reinsurance brokers. In 2023, the top five independent brokers accounted for 37% of gross premiums written in our
underwriting operations. Additionally, a significant portion of the reinsurance contracts securitized through our ILS operations, for the benefit of third-
party investors, are placed through these five independent brokers.
Ceded Reinsurance
In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a premium. In a retrocessional
reinsurance transaction, a reinsured exposure is further ceded to another reinsurer. Within our underwriting operations, we seek to retain as much of
our profitable business as possible while managing volatility within our underwriting results and capital requirements at our insurance subsidiaries.
We purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage our net retention on individual risks and overall exposure to losses, while
providing us with the ability to offer policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. This includes purchasing sufficient coverage for our
catastrophe-exposed policies to ensure that our net retained catastrophe risk is within our corporate tolerances. The structure of our reinsurance
purchases may vary from year to year depending on our risk tolerance and the availability and cost of reinsurance, as determined by current market
conditions. In such instances, we may in turn modify our gross premium writings to manage our overall net loss exposures. Net retention of gross
premium volume in our underwriting segments was 82% in 2023.
Ceded reinsurance and retrocessional contracts do not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we will be
required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. We attempt to
minimize credit exposure to reinsurers through adherence to internal ceded reinsurance guidelines. We manage our exposures so that no unsecured
exposure to any one reinsurer is material to our ongoing business. Treaties typically contain provisions that allow us to demand that a reinsurer post
letters of credit or assets as collateral if a reinsurer becomes an unauthorized reinsurer under applicable regulations or if its rating falls below an
acceptable level.

See note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk for additional information about our ceded reinsurance programs and exposures.
Competition and Underwriting Philosophy
We compete with numerous domestic and international insurance companies and reinsurers, Lloyd's syndicates, risk retention groups, insurance
buying groups, risk securitization programs, alternative capital sources, such as that provided through ILS, and alternative self-insurance
mechanisms. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets, particularly
companies with new or "disruptive" technologies or business models. Competition may take the form of lower prices, broader coverages, greater
product flexibility, enhanced digital capabilities for distribution of insurance products, higher coverage limits, higher quality services or higher ratings
by independent rating agencies. In all of our markets, we compete on the basis of overall financial strength, ratings assigned by independent rating
agencies, development of specialty products to satisfy well-defined market needs and by maintaining relationships with agents, brokers and insureds
who rely on our expertise. This expertise is our principal means of competing. We offer a diverse portfolio of products, each with its own distinct
competitive environment, which requires us to be responsive to changes in market conditions for individual product lines. With each of our products,
we seek to write business that produces consistent underwriting profits by maintaining adequate rates for our premium writings in relation to
expected loss cost trends.
Few barriers exist to prevent competition from entering our markets within the property and casualty industry. Market conditions, risk tolerance and
capital capacity influence the degree of competition at any point in time. During periods of excess underwriting capacity, as defined by availability of
capital, competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers. During periods of reduced underwriting
capacity, pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers. Historically, the performance of the property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance industries has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity, followed by
periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. At any given time, our portfolio of insurance products could be experiencing
varying combinations of these characteristics.
Within our underwriting operations, we seek to earn an underwriting profit every year. The property and casualty insurance industry commonly
defines underwriting profit or loss as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance
expenses. We believe that the ability to achieve consistent underwriting profits demonstrates knowledge and expertise, commitment to superior
customer service and the ability to manage insurance risk. We use underwriting profit or loss as a basis for evaluating our underwriting performance.
The combined ratio is a measure of underwriting performance and represents the relationship of incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and
underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses to earned premiums. A combined ratio less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while a
combined ratio greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss. In 2023, our combined ratio was 98%. See Item 7 Management's Discussion &
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our underwriting results.
We routinely review the pricing for all of our product lines. When we believe the prevailing market price will not support our underwriting profit
targets, the business is not written. As a result of our underwriting discipline, gross premium volume may vary when we alter our product offerings to
maintain or improve underwriting profitability. For example, in 2023, we adjusted our writings within our U.S. and Bermuda directors and officers and
errors and omissions product lines in our Insurance segment in response to unfavorable loss cost trends and downward pressure on rates.
Underwriting Segments
We monitor and assess the performance of our ongoing underwriting operations on a global basis in the following two segments: Insurance and
Reinsurance. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional segment reporting disclosures.

Our professional liability product lines provide insurance solutions for small, middle market and risk management accounts with coverage that is
tailored to their exposures and needs. Professional liability coverages include errors and omissions, directors and officers, cyber, employment
practices liability, professional indemnity, transaction liability, intellectual property and union liability. Errors and omissions coverage provides
solutions for specialized professions including lawyers, accountants, agents and brokers, service technicians and consultants, as well as other less-
specialized professionals. Directors and officers coverage is provided for publicly-traded, private and non-profit companies, including financial
institutions and Fortune 1000 companies. We also offer claims-made professional liability coverage for individual healthcare providers and coverages
for medical facilities.
Personal lines products provide first and third-party coverages in the U.S. for classic cars, motorcycles and a variety of personal watercraft, including
vintage boats, high-performance boats and yachts and recreational vehicles, such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and ATVs. Additionally, property
coverages are offered for homeowners that do not qualify for standard homeowner's coverage, as well as personal umbrella coverage.
Marine and energy products include a portfolio of coverages for cargo, energy, hull, liability, war and terrorism risks worldwide. The cargo product
line is an international transit-based book providing coverage for many types of cargo. Energy coverage includes all aspects of oil, gas and renewable
energy activities. Our renewable energy activities include coverages for onshore and offshore wind farms, as well as alternative energy generation
and storage technology projects. Hull coverages consist of coverage for physical damage to ocean-going tonnage, yachts and mortgagees' interests.
Liability coverage provides coverage for a broad range of energy liabilities, as well as traditional marine exposures including charterers, terminal
operators and ship repairers. Marine war coverage includes protections for the hulls of ships, and other related interests, against war and associated
perils. Terrorism coverage includes coverage for property damage and business interruption related to political and civil violence and war on land.
Property coverages consist principally of fire, allied lines (including windstorm, hail and water damage) and other specialized property coverages,
including catastrophe-exposed property risks such as earthquake and wind on both a primary and excess basis. Catastrophe-exposed property risks
can present higher severity than more standard property risks due to the impacts from earthquakes and severe weather events such as hurricanes,
convective storms and wildfires. Our property coverages are exposed to windstorm losses that, based on the seasonal nature of those events, are
more likely to occur in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Our property risks range from small, single-location accounts to large, multi-state,
multi-location, multi-national accounts on a worldwide basis. Other types of property products include inland marine products, railroad-related
products and specie coverage for fine art on exhibition and in private collections.
Specialty programs business is offered in the U.S. on a standalone or package basis and generally targets specialized commercial markets and
various customer groups, such as amateur sports and fitness clubs. Certain specialty programs written in this segment use managing general agents
to offer single source admitted and non-admitted programs for a specific industry, class or line of business.
Workers' compensation products are offered in the U.S. and provide wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of
employment and target main-street, service and artisan contractor businesses, retail stores and restaurants.
Credit and surety products consist primarily of trade credit and prepayment coverage and a range of bonds and guarantees that support contractual
obligations, as well as other coverages for specific credit risks, markets and contingencies. Key credit risks covered include those of counterparty
insolvency and defaults by government-owned entities. The key coverages under surety products include contractual performance and payment
risks, commercial license and permit obligations and obligations related to judicial proceedings such as court and fiduciary bonds.
Other product lines within the Insurance segment primarily include collateral protection insurance, which insures personal automobiles and other
vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies.

Program Services and Other Fronting
Our program services and other fronting business generates fee income in the form of ceding fees in exchange for fronting insurance and reinsurance
business for other insurance carriers (capacity providers). In general, fronting refers to business in which we write insurance on behalf of a general
agent or capacity provider and then cede all, or substantially all, of the risk under these policies to the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees.
The results of our program services and other fronting operations are not included in a reportable segment.
Our program services business, which is provided through our State National division, offers issuing carrier capacity to both specialty managing
general agents and other producers who sell, control and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume
reinsurance risk, including the Nephila Reinsurers. These reinsurers include domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors that want to
access specific lines of U.S. property and casualty insurance business but may not have the required licenses, filings or financial strength ratings to
do so.
Beginning in 2024, our State National division is expanding internationally through a partnership with our Markel International division to create an
international program services division to serve managing general agents in the U.K. market. The new division is another example of how we can
leverage our array of capabilities to effectively and efficiently connect capital with risk.
Through our program services business, we write a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance products, principally including general liability,
commercial liability, commercial multi-peril, property and workers' compensation. Program services business written through our State National
division is separately managed from our underwriting divisions, which may write similar products, in order to protect our program services customers.
The following table summarizes the subsidiaries through which our program services business is written.
Legal Entity Abbreviation State of Domicile
City National Insurance Company CNIC Texas
National Specialty Insurance Company NSIC Texas
Pinnacle National Insurance Company PNIC Texas
State National Insurance Company, Inc. SNIC Texas
Superior Specialty Insurance Company SSIC Delaware
United Specialty Insurance Company USIC Delaware
Through these subsidiaries, our program services business is licensed or authorized to write business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Many of our programs are arranged with the assistance of brokers that are seeking to provide customized insurance solutions for specialty insurance
business that requires a carrier rated "A" by A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best). Our specialized business model relies on third-party producers or
capacity providers to provide policy administration, claims handling, cash handling, underwriting, or other traditional insurance company services. We
compete primarily on the basis of price, customer service, financial strength ratings, licenses, reputation, business model and experience.
Total revenues attributed to our program services business for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $151.8 million. Our program services
business generated $2.9 billion of gross written premium volume for the year ended December 31, 2023.
In our program services business, we enter into reinsurance agreements whereby we cede to the capacity providers 100% of the premium written
and substantially all of our gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of us by the producer. As a result of our contract design,
substantially all of the underwriting risk and operational risk inherent in the arrangement is borne by the capacity providers.
Our contracts with capacity providers do not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we will be required
to pay the loss and bear collection risk if a capacity provider fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. As a result, we remain
exposed to the credit risk of capacity providers, including the risk that one of our capacity providers becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable or
unwilling to pay policyholder claims. We mitigate this credit risk generally by either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized capacity
providers or requiring that the capacity provider post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks, which, in some instances, exceeds the
related reinsurance recoverable.
10K - 11

In our other fronting business, we leverage the strength of our underwriting platform, including our highly rated insurance subsidiaries, to write
business on behalf of our Nephila ILS operations, in exchange for ceding fees, to support its business plans and assist in meeting its desired return
objectives. Our other fronting business is managed separately from our program services business. The results of our other fronting business are not
included in a reportable segment. Total revenues attributed to our other fronting business for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $20.7 million.
Our other fronting business generated $840.9 million of gross written premium volume for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Business written on behalf of our Nephila ILS operations within both our program services and other fronting operations primarily consists of
catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance business, as well as specialty and climate reinsurance business. The business written is
ceded to the Nephila Reinsurers, whose investors ultimately assume the risk. To mitigate credit risk for this business, we require collateral up to a
specified level of annual aggregate agreement year losses, which is held in a trust for which we are the beneficiary. See note 18 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details regarding our programs with Nephila Reinsurers.
Although we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our program services and other fronting businesses, we have certain programs that
contain limits on our reinsurers' obligations to us that expose us to underwriting risk, including loss ratio caps, aggregate reinsurance limits or
exclusion of the credit risk of producers. Under certain programs, including programs and contracts with Nephila Reinsurers, we also bear
underwriting risk for annual aggregate agreement year losses in excess of a limit that we believe is unlikely to be exceeded.
Insurance-Linked Securities
Our insurance-linked securities operations are primarily comprised of our Nephila operations and are not included in a reportable segment. Nephila
Holdings Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Nephila) provides investment and insurance management services through which we offer alternative
capital to the insurance and reinsurance markets while providing investors with investment strategies that typically are uncorrelated with traditional
asset classes. We receive management fees for investment and insurance management services provided through these operations, and for certain
funds, incentive fees based on their annual performance. Our management fees are based on the net asset value of the accounts managed for most
of our funds and gross premium volume for the remaining funds. Total revenues from our insurance-linked securities operations for the year ended
December 31, 2023 were $99.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, Nephila's net assets under management were $6.8 billion.
Our fund management operations provide insurance and investment management services for a broad range of investment products for insurance
and reinsurance companies, government entities, banks, hedge funds, pension funds and institutional investors, including insurance-linked securities
such as catastrophe bonds, insurance swaps, traditional reinsurance contracts, industry loss warranties and other financial instruments. Nephila
serves as the investment manager to several Bermuda based private funds (the Nephila Funds). To provide access for the Nephila Funds to a variety
of insurance-linked securities in the property catastrophe, climate and specialty markets, Nephila acts as an insurance manager to certain Bermuda
Class 3, collateralized and special purpose reinsurance companies, Lloyd's Syndicate 2357 and Lloyd's Syndicate 2358 (collectively, the Nephila
Reinsurers). The results of the Nephila Reinsurers are attributed to the Nephila Funds primarily through derivative transactions between these
entities. Neither the Nephila Funds nor the Nephila Reinsurers are subsidiaries of Markel Group, and as such, these entities are not included in our
consolidated financial statements.
The Nephila Reinsurers subscribe to various property, climate and specialty reinsurance contracts based on their investors' risk profiles, which
include business ceded by our underwriting and program services and other fronting platforms. We write this business on behalf of our Nephila ILS
operations to the extent it fits Nephila investors' risk profile and cede substantially all of the risk to Nephila Reinsurers. See note 18 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details regarding transactions with entities managed through our Nephila
operations.

Ratings
Financial stability and strength are important considerations of policyholders, cedents and insurance agents and brokers. Because an insurance
premium paid today purchases coverage for losses that might not be paid for many years, the financial viability of the insurer is of critical concern.
Various independent rating agencies provide information and assign ratings to assist buyers in their search for financially sound insurers. Rating
agencies periodically re-evaluate assigned ratings based upon changes in the insurer's operating results, financial condition or other significant
factors influencing the insurer's business. Downgrades in assigned ratings and other negative actions could have an adverse impact on an insurer's
ability to write new business.
Rating agencies assign financial strength ratings (FSRs) to property and casualty insurance companies, or group of companies, based on quantitative
criteria such as profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as qualitative assessments such as market placement, business profile, adequacy and
soundness of ceded reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of loss reserves and surplus and competence, experience
and integrity of management.
Sixteen of our seventeen insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, while our Lloyd's syndicate is part of a group rating for the Lloyd's overall
market. All sixteen of our insurance subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best have been assigned an FSR of "A" (excellent). The Lloyd's group has been
assigned an FSR of "A" (excellent) by A.M. Best.
Nine of our seventeen insurance subsidiaries are rated by Standard & Poor's (S&P), while our Lloyd's syndicate is part of a group rating for the Lloyd's
overall market. All nine of our insurance subsidiaries rated by S&P have been assigned an FSR of "A" (strong). The Lloyd's group has been assigned
an FSR of "A+" (strong) by S&P.
Five of our seventeen insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moody's Corporation (Moody's). All five insurance subsidiaries rated by Moody's have been
assigned an FSR of "A2" (good).
Investments
Our investment operations manage the capital held within our underwriting operations, as well as capital allocated by Markel Group. Invested assets
managed through our investment operations includes our portfolio of publicly traded fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as cash and short-
term investments.
Our underwriting operations provide our investment operations with steady inflows of premiums. These funds are invested predominantly in high-
quality government and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities that generally match the duration and currency of our loss reserves. We
typically hold these investments until maturity. As a result, unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are generally expected to reverse
as the securities mature. Premiums collected through our underwriting operations may also be held as short-term investments or cash and cash
equivalents to provide short-term liquidity for projected claims payments, reinsurance costs and operating expenses.
Our investments in equity securities are predominantly held within our regulated insurance subsidiaries to support capital requirements. Capital held
by our insurance subsidiaries beyond that which we anticipate will be needed to cover claims payments and operating expenses is available to be
invested in equity securities, along with additional capital allocated for investment purposes by Markel Group. We allocate a higher percentage of
capital to equity securities than most other insurance companies. Over the long run, equity securities have produced higher returns relative to fixed
maturity securities and short-term investments.
10K - 13

When purchasing equity securities, we seek to invest in profitable companies with high returns on capital and low debt, with honest and talented
management and significant reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, all while paying reasonable prices for those securities. We intend to
hold these equity investments over the long-term. We believe our long-term time horizon and internal sourcing of capital for investment provides us
with a distinct competitive advantage compared to other companies. Substantially all of our investment portfolio is managed by company employees,
which helps minimize costs in our investment operations. The breadth of our operating businesses, and the experience we garner from supporting
them, also informs and enhances the efficacy of our investment activities.
Invested assets, comprised of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and
cash equivalents, were $30.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The following chart displays the composition of our invested assets as of December 31,
2023.
We measure our investment performance by analyzing net investment income earned on our investment portfolio, which reflects the recurring
interest and dividend earnings on our investment portfolio. In 2023, our net investment income was $734.5 million. We also analyze net investment
gains, which include unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio. Based on the potential for volatility in the financial markets, we understand
that the level of gains or losses may vary from one period to the next, and therefore believe that our investment performance is best analyzed over
longer periods of time. Our annual return on equity securities for the five-year period ended December 31, 2023 was 14.6%.

Markel Ventures
Through our wholly owned subsidiary Markel Ventures, Inc. (Markel Ventures), we own controlling interests in high-quality businesses that operate in
a variety of different industries with shared values and the shared goal of positively contributing to the long-term financial performance of Markel
Group. Management teams for each business operate autonomously and are responsible for developing strategic initiatives, managing day-to-day
operations and making investment and capital allocation decisions for their respective companies. Our Markel Ventures management team is
responsible for decisions regarding allocation of capital for acquisitions and new investments. Our strategy in making these acquisitions is similar to
our strategy for purchasing equity securities. We seek to invest in profitable companies, with honest and talented management, that exhibit
reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, at reasonable prices. We intend to own the businesses acquired for a long period of time.
Our chief operating decision maker allocates resources to and assesses the performance of these various businesses in the aggregate as the Markel
Ventures segment. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional segment reporting disclosures.
The Markel Ventures segment includes a diverse portfolio of specialized businesses from different industries that offer various types of products and
services to businesses and consumers across many markets. All of our businesses in this segment are headquartered in the U.S., with subsidiaries of
certain businesses located outside of the U.S. In 2021, our Markel Ventures operations expanded through acquisitions of majority interests in
Metromont LLC and Buckner HeavyLift Cranes. See note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional
details related to these acquisitions. This follows the acquisition of Lansing Building Products, LLC in 2020 and VSC Fire & Security, Inc. in 2019. We
continue to look for acquisition opportunities that align with our investment criteria and strategic objectives around diversification and specialization.
In 2023, our Markel Ventures operations reported revenues of $5.0 billion, operating income of $437.5 million and earnings before interest, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $628.5 million. We use Markel Ventures EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an
operating performance measure in conjunction with operating income. See "Markel Ventures" under Item 7 Management's Discussion & Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our Markel Ventures results, including EBITDA.
The following chart displays the types of businesses within our Markel Ventures segment based on 2023 operating revenues. Our Markel Ventures
management team does not manage the Markel Ventures portfolio of businesses at this level of aggregation due to the distinct characteristics of
each business and the autonomy with which local management operates each business.

Markel Ventures businesses encounter a variety of competitors that vary by industry, end market and geographic area. Each Markel Ventures
business has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of its respective end markets and geographic areas.
Many of the businesses in this segment experience revenue fluctuations over time due to the cyclical nature of supply and demand in their particular
industry. For example, the construction industry is cyclical based on certain larger economic trends and factors, including the inflationary and interest
rate environment and, for some businesses, the level of government investment. Additionally, many of our businesses experience fluctuation in
demand throughout the year based on the seasonality of the products they sell or services they provide. For example, the demand for ornamental
plants is particularly high during the spring and summer seasons as compared to the rest of the year.

Businesses in this segment are reliant on inputs, such as raw materials and labor, to manufacture products and deliver services, and the operating
results of these businesses could be impacted by the ability or inability to source these inputs and obtain price increases from customers in response
to increases in the price of these inputs, including the cost of shipping. For example, shipping costs at some of our businesses increased significantly
in 2022 before reverting to more typical levels in 2023, which has resulted in higher margins in 2023 compared to 2022 at the impacted businesses.
Management teams for each of our businesses proactively manage the risks and challenges posed by cyclicality, seasonality and inflation, among
other things, in a variety of ways as appropriate and as needed for their business.
Regulatory Environment
We are subject to extensive U.S. state and federal, as well as international, regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business.
Regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, as a company with publicly traded securities, we are also subject to certain legal and
regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange relating to reporting and disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance
and other matters.
The following is a summary of significant regulations that apply to our businesses, but it is not intended to be a comprehensive review of every
regulation to which we are subject. For information regarding certain risks associated with regulations applicable to our businesses, see Item 1A Risk
Factors.
Group Insurance Regulation and Supervision
Group Supervision - Global Supervisory College; Global Common Framework. Regulators within and outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the
regulation of multinational insurers by conducting a supervisory college. A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional
authority over an insurance holding company's worldwide insurance subsidiaries. The supervisory college meets with executive management to
evaluate the insurance group on both a group-wide and legal-entity basis, particularly with respect to its financial data, business strategies,
enterprise risk management and corporate governance. The Illinois Department of Insurance is our lead insurance regulator for purposes of
conducting our supervisory college.
In 2020, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors adopted its Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active
Insurance Groups (ComFrame). ComFrame establishes a comprehensive framework for supervisors to address group-wide activities and risks of
internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) and lays the groundwork for better supervisory cooperation and coordination. ComFrame requires the
designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each IAIG and imposes a group capital requirement that will be applied to an IAIG in addition to
the current legal entity capital requirements imposed by state and international insurance regulators. In response to ComFrame, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) revised the model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to allow state insurance
regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S. based IAIGs. In 2023, it was determined that we meet the criteria to be
identified as an IAIG. The Illinois Department of Insurance has been designated as our group-wide supervisor.
Holding Company Statutes. We also are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems, which typically require that we
periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership,
financial condition, dividend payments and other material transactions with affiliates, and general business operations. These statutes also require
approval of changes in control of an insurer or an insurance holding company. Generally, "control" for these purposes is defined as ownership or
voting power of 10% or more of a company's voting shares. We also must submit an annual group-level enterprise risk report, which provides
information regarding material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to its U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment and Enterprise Risk Management. We must submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report
(ORSA) annually to our lead insurance regulator. The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an
insurer's current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. In addition, we must file an annual enterprise risk
report with our lead insurance regulator. The report must identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose
enterprise risk to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

U.S. Insurance Regulation
State Regulation
Overview. Our U.S. insurance company subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions
in which they do business. In the U.S., authority for the regulation, supervision and administration of the business of insurance in each state is
generally delegated to a state insurance commissioner who oversees a regulatory body responsible for the supervision of the business of insurance.
State regulatory authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers relating to: solvency standards; corporate conduct; market
conduct activities; regulating unfair trade and claims practices; licensing of insurers; licensing and appointment of agents; approval of forms and
policies used; the nature of, and limitations on, insurers' investments; the form and content of annual statements and other reports on the financial
condition of insurers; and establishment of loss reserves. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and
independent agents. In addition, the NAIC, comprised of the insurance commissioners of each U.S. jurisdiction, develops or amends model statutes
and regulations that, in turn, most states adopt.
Risk Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC uses a risk based capital (RBC) formula to measure the capital of an insurer, taking into account the
company's investments and products. For property and casualty insurance companies, RBC requirements establish capital thresholds for four
categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk.
Financial Exams. State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial
examinations of insurers regarding activities in their respective states, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for
permissible types and amounts of investments and require minimum capital and surplus levels. These statutory capital and surplus requirements
include RBC rules promulgated by the NAIC.
Statutory Accounting Principles. Each of our U.S. insurance companies is required to file detailed quarterly and annual reports, including financial
statements, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules. The quarterly and annual financial reports utilize statutory accounting
principles (SAP) that are different from U.S. GAAP. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with monitoring the solvency of
insurance companies to assure an insurer's ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders.
Rates and Form Filings. The policy forms and various premium rates of our U.S. admitted insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in every
state in which they conduct business. In many states, rates and policy forms must be filed with the applicable insurance regulator prior to their use,
and in some states, rates and forms must be affirmatively approved by the applicable insurance regulator prior to use.
Dividends. The laws of the domicile states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries govern the amount of dividends that may be paid to our holding
company, Markel Group. Generally, statutes in the domicile states of our insurance subsidiaries require prior approval for payment of extraordinary,
as opposed to ordinary, dividends. See note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8.
Market Conduct. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of
insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, data security, compliance of underwriting services to policyholders,
confirmation of licensing and appointment of producers, claims management, anti-fraud controls and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities
generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
Investment Regulation. Investments by our U.S. insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations that prescribe the kind,
quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations,
corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and
certain other qualifications.
Cybersecurity; Data Privacy. Several states have enacted laws establishing cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, including
insurance companies, that require implementation of security measures for the monitoring, detection, prevention, mitigation and management of
cybersecurity incidents. Several states also have enacted laws addressing data privacy concerns and the protection of consumer data.
10K - 18

Federal Regulation
The U.S. federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, two federal
government bodies, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), each created under The Dodd Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may impact the regulation of insurance. Although the FIO is prohibited from directly regulating the
business of insurance, it has authority to represent the U.S. in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of
state insurance laws. The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in
the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure. We have not been so designated. The U.S. federal laws that most affect our day-to-day
insurance operations are: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair Credit Reporting Act; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996;
the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010; the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
International Insurance Regulation
Overview. Our international insurance operations are subject to regulation and supervision in various jurisdictions. These regulations, which vary
depending on the jurisdiction, include, among others, solvency and market conduct regulations; anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and anti-
terrorism financing guidelines, laws and regulations; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff, trade and sanctions laws and regulations; and corporate,
competition, employment, intellectual property and investment laws and regulations. Our international insurance operations are domiciled in the
U.K., Europe and Bermuda and are subject to regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, we conduct business in Canada, Asia, Australia and the
Middle East, where our businesses also are supervised by local regulatory authorities.
U.K. and European Regulation. We are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority in respect of our
U.K. insurance businesses. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, better known by its abbreviation BaFin, in
respect of our German insurance carrier.
Our U.K. and German insurance businesses are subject to both the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Solvency II Directive
(Solvency II).
GDPR requires businesses operating in the E.U., and businesses transacting with E.U. citizens, to comply with conditions for processing personal data.
Following the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., GDPR was transposed into U.K. law. The E.U. has granted adequacy status to the U.K.'s data protection laws,
valid until June 2025 with the possibility of renewal, meaning that they are deemed essentially equivalent to E.U. data protection laws.
Solvency II requires our U.K. and German businesses to maintain certain capital standards and publish risk-related information in the form of a
Solvency and Financial Condition Report. Following the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., Solvency II also was transposed into U.K. law as retained law. The
U.K. government, under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, has opted to repeal certain portions of retained E.U. law. This repeal will occur
in stages and, where necessary, after replacement regulations designed for the U.K. are in place. This repeal of retained E.U. law includes reforms to
Solvency II. The Prudential Regulation Authority has consulted on the reforms, to be known as Solvency UK, which are expected to be implemented in
2024.
Bermuda Regulation. The insurance industry in Bermuda is regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Under the Bermuda Insurance Act
1978, and related regulations and standards of the BMA, each Bermuda insurance company is subject to, among other things: licensing, capital,
surplus and liquidity requirements; solvency standards; restrictions on dividends and distributions; and periodic examinations of the company and its
financial condition. In addition, each insurance company must obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares and maintain a principal
office and appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. The BMA also requires that each insurance company contract for local
services, such as corporate secretary and registered representative services, at market rates.

ILS Regulation
Our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations are subject to regulation and supervision by various regulatory authorities, both in the U.S. and
internationally. Certain of our ILS subsidiaries are organized and regulated as follows:
• registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
• registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor under the
Commodity Exchange Act, and/or
• registered with the BMA as an insurance manager under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978.
Certain other ILS subsidiaries serve as the investment manager to one or more private funds that are registered with the BMA under the Investment
Funds Act 2006, as amended, or the Segregated Accounts Companies Act 2000, as amended. In addition, these operations include business
relationships with certain U.S., U.K. and Bermuda insurance companies that are subject to U.S. and international insurance regulation as previously
described in this "Regulatory Environment" section.
As a result, subsidiaries involved in our ILS operations are subject to regulations that may impose substantive and material restrictions and
requirements on their operations, including, among other things: a broader fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their clients; disclosure of
information about our businesses and conflicts of interests to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive
books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge, including performance fees; restrictions on solicitation arrangements;
requirements regarding engaging in transactions with clients; maintenance of an effective compliance program; and other restrictions and
requirements applicable to custody of client assets, client privacy, advertising, pay-to-play prohibitions and cybersecurity; as well as possible
sanctions, disciplinary actions or other penalties for non-compliance.
Markel Ventures Regulation
Our Markel Ventures businesses are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as international laws and
regulations applicable to their international operations. Specifically, the most significant of these laws and regulations cover the following areas:
safety, health, employment, the environment, transportation, U.S. and international trade, anti-corruption, data privacy and security and government
contracts.
Human Capital
Our culture is our greatest asset and is defined by the Markel Style. Written in 1986, in preparation for our initial public offering, the Markel Style
memorialized how we seek to operate our businesses and treat one another. It continues to provide our guiding principles across our diverse group of
businesses. Key within the Markel Style is the encouragement to look for a better way to do things, to challenge management. We also seek
spontaneity and flexibility and have a respect for authority, but disdain for bureaucracy. Our holding company and each of our businesses is
managed in a way to accomplish these principles. Each of our businesses operates with a high degree of autonomy so long as they operate within the
principles of the Markel Style. This allows our managers to make decisions that are best for their employees and customers, as well as our
shareholders. We believe this high degree of empowerment leads to the satisfaction that comes from being trusted in the responsibilities one has
been given.
Further outlined in the Markel Style is our creed of honesty and fairness in all our dealings; holding the individual's right to self-determination in the
highest light; putting aside individual concerns in the spirit of teamwork; and providing an atmosphere in which people can reach their full potential.
We greatly value our employees, encourage their career development and reward their pursuit of excellence, while also celebrating a diverse
workforce.
At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 21,600 employees, of whom approximately 5,400 were employed within our insurance operations and
approximately 16,200 were employed within our Markel Ventures operations.
Insurance
Our specialty insurance business, Markel, markets and underwrites specialty insurance products. Markel has a well-developed process to ensure
effective performance management, including an embedded annual review process that enables goal setting, development planning and
performance assessment. Markel has also established global leadership development programs for different levels of leadership at Markel, partnering
with various schools to create leading-edge curricula in this area.
10K - 20

With the Markel Style as the foundation, Markel has identified five pillars of focus that relate to today's challenges and opportunities—diversity and
inclusion, community, innovation, well-being, and recognition. This program is both company and employee led—collectively, we want to bring the
values of the Markel Style to life with our actions, not just our words. The intent is to create an environment where employees are able to
authentically bring their true selves to work, a place where all ideas are heard and diverse perspectives are valued, a culture that prioritizes
innovation, the ability to make a difference for our local communities and the wider world, and a foundation for holding ourselves accountable for our
own well-being and of those around us.
Employee health and overall well-being is a key priority, and we provide a range of employee and eligible partner plans and programs, including
health and voluntary benefits. These offerings include a variety of financial protection programs to help our employees meet their unique investment
and savings needs including life insurance, retirement savings with company contributions in most situations and an employee stock purchase plan.
Comprehensive employee assistance programs are available in all of our major markets along with other well-being and fitness resources.
We rely on our employees' ideas and input to help make Markel a great place to work. For example, senior leadership conducts regular employee
communication meetings, inclusive of question and answer sessions, across our insurance operations and provides opportunities for employees to
share their ideas on how we can improve employee engagement. In addition, every two years we conduct a major, global employee engagement
survey, which in early 2022 garnered 88% participation, and which enables us to identify, focus on and track progress against key engagement
drivers and external norms for high performing companies. This survey has generated additional ideas for employee engagement, and we have made
meaningful changes and improvements in our human capital practices based on this feedback. Plans are underway to conduct an employee
engagement survey in early 2024. Additionally, Markel conducts regular pulse and employee net promoter score surveys on a departmental level
across the organization throughout the year.
We are committed to embracing all aspects of diversity, including diversity of perspective, which we believe is crucial to sustainable success. Markel
accordingly supports and encourages focused efforts to continue to build the diversity of our employee population and the inclusiveness of our
culture. Our diversity and inclusion efforts seek to cultivate an inclusive environment in which every employee feels valued, respected and accepted.
We believe this environment helps us increase creativity and innovation, foster business connections, serve our customers and maintain our market
leadership.
Markel's global Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Steering Committee comprises more than 15 senior managers who are charged with advising on D&I
strategy and providing leadership support and advocacy for our D&I efforts. Our Human Resources leadership team works to further shape the D&I
strategy for our global workforce, and to ensure the integration of our D&I efforts with our global talent acquisition and development processes. We
have various early career programs open to a diverse range of applicants and a regional scholarship program that is focused on underrepresented
groups.
Markel supports a range of employee-led D&I networks and resource groups, including our Markel Women's Network, BEAM (Black Engagement at
Markel), PRISM (LGBTQ+), Jitneys (Young Professionals), Markel Asian Professionals Network, Markel Veterans Network, UN1DOS (Latin and Hispanic
Network), and across our international operations, an Inclusion Network with connections to a number of the London market partner networks. All of
these networks and organizations have put in place goals and programming that are focused on education and development, community
engagement, talent acquisition and networking/support. Additionally, we continue our global sponsorship of Dive-In, the insurance industry's annual
diversity and inclusion festival.
Markel Ventures
Our Markel Ventures operations are comprised of a diverse portfolio of businesses from different industries through which we own controlling
interests. The Markel Ventures operations are viewed by management as separate and distinct from our insurance operations with local management
teams that direct the strategy and day-to-day operations of their respective companies, including human capital matters. When making these
acquisitions, we seek, among other things, businesses whose leadership teams demonstrate equal measures of both integrity and talent. As a result,
each Markel Ventures business fosters a culture within their operations, and with their employees, that aligns with the principles of the Markel Style.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
A wide range of factors could materially affect our future prospects and performance. The matters addressed in Item 7 Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including under "Safe Harbor and Cautionary Statement" and "Critical Accounting
Estimates", and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, as well as other information included or incorporated in this
report, describe many of the significant risks that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to the
risks discussed below.
One or more of the risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, and others we cannot anticipate, could have material adverse effects on our results
of operations and financial condition; and the extent of these effects will depend, at least in part, on the scope, severity, frequency or duration of the
specific event or circumstance. In addition, we may take steps to prevent, mitigate or manage potential risks or liabilities, and related developments,
and some of those steps may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Even if an unfavorable outcome
does not materialize, these factors, and actions we may take in response, may have a material adverse impact on our reputation or result in
substantial expense and disruption.
Headings and sub-headings for the Risk Factors below are for reference purposes only and are not intended to limit or affect in any way the meaning
or scope of each Risk Factor.
Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations
Loss Exposures
We may experience losses or disruptions from catastrophes. As a company with significant property and casualty insurance underwriting
operations, we may experience losses from man-made or natural catastrophes. Catastrophes include, but are not limited to, windstorms, hurricanes,
earthquakes, tornadoes, derechos, hail, severe winter weather, floods and wildfires and may include pandemics and events related to terrorism,
broad reaching cyberattacks, riots and political and civil unrest. While we employ catastrophe modeling tools in our underwriting process, we cannot
predict how severe a potential catastrophe will be before it occurs. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of losses
incurred, the number of insureds affected, the frequency and severity of the events, the effectiveness of our catastrophe risk management program
and the adequacy of our reinsurance coverage. Catastrophes can occur over numerous geographic areas; however, some catastrophes may produce
significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. We offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of
our programs, and in other instances we are legally required to offer terrorism insurance; in both circumstances, we actively manage our exposure,
but if there is a covered terrorist attack, we could sustain material losses. In addition, catastrophes may have a material adverse effect on the
investment management and incentive fees earned by our insurance-linked securities (ILS) operations and returns on our investments in ILS funds.
Catastrophes also may result in significant disruptions in our insurance and other operations, as well as loss of income and assets. The impacts of
climate change may increase the frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophes, which may result in elevated catastrophe-related losses
or disruptions, which may be material.
The failure of any of the methods we employ to manage our loss exposures could have a material adverse effect on us. We seek to
manage our loss exposures in a variety of ways, including adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones,
implementing maximum gross limits by coverage for each insured, establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event, employing
coverage restrictions and following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written. We also seek to manage our loss exposures through
geographic and industry diversification. Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable
and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more future events
could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, we seek to manage our loss exposures by policy terms, coverage exclusions and choice of legal forum. Disputes
relating to coverage and choice of legal forum also arise. As a result, various provisions of our policies, such as choice of forum, or coverage
limitations or exclusions, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our methods to manage loss exposures may prove
ineffective.
The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing
the frequency and/or severity of claims. For example, rising costs, litigation funding, social inflation, including new or expanded theories of liability,
higher adverse verdicts, and
10K - 22

legislative changes, such as extended statutes of limitations, may result in higher and more frequent claims over a longer reporting period than
originally expected. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that
are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years
after a contract is issued.
We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and actual
results may differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses. We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g.,
scenarios, predictive and stochastic modeling, and forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our
insurance and ILS businesses. This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in, among other
things, decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk. We incorporate
numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity
markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related analyses from both
proprietary models and third-party models are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors, complexities and the inherent
limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions.
In addition, the modeled outputs and related analyses may from time to time contain inaccuracies, perhaps in material respects, including as a result
of inaccurate inputs or applications thereof (whether due to data error, human error or otherwise). Consequently, actual results may differ materially
from our modeled results. Our profitability and financial condition substantially depend on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent
with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to
appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
Loss Reserves
Our results may be affected because actual insured or reinsured losses differ from our loss reserves. Significant periods of time often
elapse between the occurrence of an insured or reinsured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for
unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses
and the related loss adjustment expenses. The process of estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex exercise involving analytical models with
many variables and subjective judgments. This process may also become more difficult if we experience a period of rising inflation, as has been the
case since early 2021.
As part of the reserving process, we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors, such as:
• trends in claim frequency and severity;
• changes in operations;
• changes to mix of business, terms and conditions, limits and layers;
• emerging economic and social trends;
• trends in insurance rates;
• inflation or deflation; and
• changes in the regulatory and litigation environments.
This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for
predicting future events. There is no precise method, however, for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, and
actual results will differ from original estimates. As part of the reserving process, we regularly review our loss reserves and make adjustments as
necessary. Future increases in loss reserves for our underwriting operations will, and for our programs services operations may, result in additional
charges to earnings, which may be material.
In addition, as discussed above, we use analytical models to assist our decision making in loss reserving, and actual results may differ materially from
the model outputs and related analyses.
There is generally greater uncertainty in estimating reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability, professional liability and workers'
compensation, as they require a longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in economic and social inflation
and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. In addition, reinsurance reserves are subject
to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because a reinsurer relies on (i) the original underwriting decisions and claims decisions
made by ceding companies and (ii)
10K - 23

information and data from ceding companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated
the risks reinsured by us and the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. In addition, reinsurance reserves may
be less reliable than insurance reserves because there is generally a longer lapse of time from the occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss
or benefit to the reinsurer and ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss. Reserves for contracts for which we are not the primary insurer, and
participate only in excess layers of loss, are also subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves for contracts for which we are the primary
insurer for many of the same reasons as reinsurance reserves.
Changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book could result in
material increases in our estimated loss reserves for such business. Our run-off life and annuity reinsurance book exposes us to mortality
risk, which is the risk that the level of death claims may differ from that which we assumed in establishing the reserves for our life and annuity
reinsurance contracts. Some of our life and annuity reinsurance contracts expose us to longevity risk, which is the risk that an insured person will live
longer than expected when the reserves were established, or morbidity risk, which is the risk that an insured person will become critically ill or
disabled. Our reserving process for the life and annuity reinsurance book is designed with the objective of establishing appropriate reserves for the
risks we assumed. Among other things, this process relies heavily on analysis of mortality, longevity and morbidity trends, lapse rates, interest rates
and expenses. As of December 31, 2023, our reserves for life and annuity benefits totaled $649.1 million.
We expect mortality, morbidity, longevity, and lapse experience to fluctuate somewhat from period to period, but believe they should remain
reasonably predictable over a period of many years. Mortality, longevity, morbidity or lapse experience that is less favorable than the mortality,
longevity, morbidity or lapse rates that we used in establishing the reserves for a reinsurance agreement will negatively affect our net income
because the reserves we originally set for the risks we assumed may not be sufficient to cover the future claims and expense payments.
Furthermore, even if the total benefits paid over the life of the contract do not exceed the expected amount, unexpected increases in the incidence
of deaths or illness can result in changes to our assumptions in a given reporting period, adversely affecting our net income in any particular
reporting period. If there are adverse changes to any of the above factors, a charge to earnings may be recorded, which may have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Ceded Reinsurance
We may be unable to purchase reinsurance protection on terms acceptable to us, or we may be unable to collect on loss recoveries
from reinsurers. Our underwriting operations purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage our net retention on individual risks
and mitigate the volatility of losses on our results of operations and financial condition, while providing us with the ability to offer policies with
sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. In addition, we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our program services and other fronting
businesses, however, we have certain programs that contain limits on our reinsurers' obligations to us that expose us to underwriting risk, including
loss ratio caps, aggregate reinsurance limits or exclusion of the credit risk of producers. See note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included under Item 8 for information about ceded reinsurance for our program services and other fronting businesses.
The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies. Reliance on reinsurance recoveries
may create credit risk as a result of the reinsurer's inability or unwillingness to pay reinsurance claims when due. We generally select well capitalized
and highly rated reinsurers and in certain instances we require reinsurers to post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks. Deterioration in
the credit quality of existing reinsurers or disputes over the terms of reinsurance could result in charges to earnings, which may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, collateral may not be sufficient to cover the reinsurer's obligation to
us, and we may not be able to cause the reinsurer to deliver additional collateral.
As of December 31, 2023, we were the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $5.1 billion,
collateralizing $9.2 billion in reinsurance recoverables. The remaining unsecured reinsurance recoverables are ceded to highly-rated, well capitalized
reinsurers. Our reinsurance recoverables are based on estimates, and our actual liabilities may exceed the amount we are able to recover from our
reinsurers or any collateral securing the reinsurance recoverables. The failure of a reinsurer to meet its obligations to us, whether due to insolvency,
dispute or other unwillingness or inability to pay, or due to our inability to access sufficient collateral to cover our liabilities, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
10K - 24

The availability and cost of reinsurance are determined by market conditions beyond our control. There is no guarantee that our desired amounts of
reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future. In addition, available capacity may not be on terms we
deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do business. This could impact our ability to write certain products and
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Market Competition and Broker Reliance
Competition in the insurance and reinsurance markets could reduce profits from our insurance operations. Insurance and reinsurance
markets are highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major United States (U.S.), Bermuda, United Kingdom (U.K.),
European, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, marketing, and
management resources than we do, have greater access to "big data," and may be able to offer a wider range of, or more sophisticated, commercial
and personal lines products. Recent industry consolidation, including business combinations among insurance and other financial services companies,
has resulted in larger competitors with even greater financial resources. In addition, capital market participants have created alternative products
that are intended to compete with reinsurance products.
Similar to other industries, the insurance industry is undergoing rapid and significant technological and other changes. There is increasing focus by
traditional insurance industry participants, technology companies, "InsurTech" start-up companies and others on using technology and innovation to
simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, redesign products, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive
changes in the insurance industry. If we do not anticipate, keep pace with and adapt to technological and other changes impacting the insurance
industry, it will harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products to customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences in the markets in which we operate also pose other risks to our
businesses. For example, they could result in increasing our service, administrative, policy acquisition or general expenses as we seek to distinguish
our products and services from those of our competitors or otherwise keep up with such innovation and changes.
Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce
our underwriting profits, or within our program services and other fronting operations, our operating profits, and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
The historical cyclicality in the property and casualty insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
improve or maintain underwriting profits or to grow or maintain premium volume. The insurance and reinsurance markets have historically
been cyclical, characterized by extended periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, and more recently alternative
sources of capital, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted more favorable rate levels. Among our competitive strengths have been
our specialty product focus and our niche market strategy. These strengths also make us vulnerable in periods of intense competition to actions by
other insurance companies who seek to write additional premiums without appropriate regard for underwriting profitability. At times it could be very
difficult for us to grow or maintain premium volume levels without sacrificing underwriting profits. If we are not successful in maintaining rates or
achieving rate increases, it may be difficult for us to improve or maintain underwriting profits or to grow or maintain premium volume levels.
Our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be
successful and may increase or create new risks. From time to time, to protect and grow market share or improve our efficiency, we invest in
strategic initiatives to:
• develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, include new coverages or change coverage terms;
• change commission terms;
• change our underwriting processes;
• improve business processes and workflow to increase efficiencies and productivity and to enhance the experience of our customers and
producers;
• expand distribution channels; and
• enter geographic markets where we previously have had relatively little or no market share.
10K - 25

We may not be successful in these efforts, and even if we are successful, they may increase or create the following risks, among others:
• demand for new products or expansion into new markets may not meet our expectations;
• new products and expansion into new markets may increase or change our risk exposures, and the data and models we use to manage those
exposures may not be as effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products;
• models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective;
• efforts to develop new products or markets or to change commission terms may create or increase distribution channel conflicts;
• in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase while the pricing for
other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins;
• changes to our business processes or workflow, including the use of new technologies, may give rise to execution risk; and
• increased usage of artificial intelligence by us and third parties and the evolving regulatory landscape may increase underwriting and
regulatory risk, while also presenting opportunity risk if we do not leverage artificial intelligence appropriately.
These efforts may require us to make substantial expenditures, which may negatively impact results in the near term, and if not successful, could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
We depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues and the loss of business provided by any one of them could have a
material adverse effect on us. We market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide through insurance and reinsurance brokers. For the year
ended December 31, 2023, our top five independent brokers represented 37% of the gross premiums written by our underwriting operations. Loss of
all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Financial Strength and Credit Ratings
Our insurance companies and senior debt are rated by various rating agencies, and a downgrade or potential downgrade in one or
more of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on us. Financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Our senior debt ratings also affect the availability and cost of capital. Certain of our
insurance and reinsurance company subsidiaries and our senior debt securities are rated by various rating agencies. Our financial strength and debt
ratings are subject to periodic review, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. The financial strength ratings of our insurance
subsidiaries are significantly influenced by their statutory surplus amounts and leverage and capital adequacy ratios and other financial metrics.
Rating agencies may implement changes to their ratings methodologies or internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the
amount of capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold or restrict how the company may deploy its capital in order to maintain its current ratings. For
example, for certain of our insurance subsidiaries, rating agencies may take into account in their calculations the collateral provided to us by
reinsurers. A change in this practice could adversely impact our ratings. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our current, or any future,
ratings. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by one or more rating agencies, our competitive position in our target markets within the
insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A ratings downgrade could result in a substantial loss of
business as policyholders and ceding company clients move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. In addition,
a downgrade could trigger contract provisions that allow cedents to terminate their reinsurance contracts on terms disadvantageous to us or require
us to collateralize our obligations through trusts or letters of credit. A ratings downgrade could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
including the availability of our letter of credit facilities, and limit our access to capital markets, increase our cost of borrowing or issuing debt and
require us to post collateral.
The amount of capital that our insurance subsidiaries have and must hold to maintain their financial strength and credit ratings and
meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors, some of which are outside
of our control. Capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators, while rating agencies
establish requirements that inform ratings for our insurance subsidiaries and senior debt securities. Projecting surplus and the related capital
requirements is complex and requires making assumptions regarding how our business will perform within the broader macroeconomic environment.
Insurance regulators and rating
10K - 26

agencies evaluate company capital through financial models that calculate minimum capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital
formulas for property and casualty insurance groups and their subsidiaries. In any particular year, capital levels and risk-based capital requirements
may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business written by our insurance subsidiaries and correlation or
diversification in the business profile, the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, the value of
securities in our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the regulatory and rating
agency models used to determine our required capital.
Insurance Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation that may have a material adverse effect on our operations and
financial condition. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the regulatory authorities in the various jurisdictions in
which they conduct business, including foreign and U.S. state insurance regulators. Regulatory authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and
administrative powers relating to, among other things, data protection and data privacy, cybersecurity, solvency standards, licensing, coverage
requirements, product terms and conditions, policy rates and forms, business and claims practices, disclosures to consumers, and the form and
content of financial reports. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be
generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. Insurance
regulatory authorities have broad authority to initiate investigations or other proceedings, and, in connection with a failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations, could impose adverse consequences, including fines, penalties, injunctions, denial or revocation of an operating license or
approval, increased scrutiny or oversight, limitations on engaging in a particular business, or redress to clients. These actions also could result in
negative publicity, reputational damage or harm to client, employee or other relationships. Additionally, regulatory and legislative authorities
continue to implement enhanced or new regulatory requirements to assure the stability of insurance companies or enhance policyholder protections
or, in certain instances, intended to prevent or mitigate future financial crises. Regulatory authorities also may seek to exercise their supervisory or
enforcement authority in new or more extensive ways, such as increased capital requirements. These actions, if they occur, could affect the
competitive market, as well as the way we conduct our business or manage our capital, and could result in lower revenues and higher costs. As a
result, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Regulators may challenge our use of fronting arrangements in states in which our capacity providers are not licensed. Our program
services and other fronting business enters into fronting arrangements with general agents and domestic and foreign insurers that want to access
specific U.S. property and casualty insurance business in states in which the capacity providers are not licensed or are not authorized to write
particular lines of insurance. Some state insurance regulators may object to these fronting arrangements. In certain states, an insurance
commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer. In addition, insurance
departments in states in which there is no such statutory or regulatory prohibition, could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance
business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance.
If regulators in any of the states where we conduct our fronting business were to prohibit or limit those arrangements, we would be prevented or
limited from conducting that business for which a capacity provider is not authorized in those states, unless and until the capacity provider is able to
obtain the necessary licenses. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Insurance-Linked Securities
Our ILS operations and our management of third-party capital may expose us to risks. Some of our operating subsidiaries may owe certain
legal duties and obligations to third-party investors. A failure to fulfill any of those duties or obligations could result in significant liabilities, penalties
or other losses, and harm our businesses and results of operations. In addition, third-party investors may decide not to renew their investments in the
funds we manage, which could materially impact the financial condition of those funds, and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain or raise additional third-party capital for the funds we
manage or for potential new funds and therefore we may forego existing or potential fee income and other income generating opportunities. For
example, investment performance at Nephila, as well as the broader ILS market, has been adversely impacted by consecutive years of elevated
catastrophe losses, as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These events, as well as volatility in the capital markets, also have impacted
investor decisions around allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn have impacted, and may continue to impact, our capital raises and redemptions
within the funds we manage, as well as new funds, resulting in a decline in assets under management. See "Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill
and Intangible
10K - 27

Assets" under Item 7. Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion and considerations of these
impacts on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets attributed to our Nephila ILS operations.
Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments and Access to Capital
Changes in Economic Conditions
Our investment results may be impacted by changes in interest rates, U.S. and international monetary and fiscal policies as well as
broader economic conditions. We receive premiums from customers for insuring their risks. We invest these funds until they are needed to pay
policyholder claims. Fluctuations in the value of our investment portfolio can occur as a result of changes in interest rates and U.S. and international
fiscal, monetary and trade policies as well as broader economic conditions (including, for example, equity market conditions and significant or
prolonged inflation or deflation). Although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in these changing environments, we may
not be able to mitigate our sensitivity to them effectively. Despite our mitigation efforts, which include duration and currency targets for asset
portfolios, compliance monitoring of these targets and means to reasonably and effectively match asset duration and currency to the duration and
currency of the loss reserves, changes in interest rates and U.S. and international fiscal, monetary and trade policies as well as broader economic
conditions could have a material adverse effect on our investment results and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.
We invest a significant portion of our shareholders' equity in equity securities, which may result in significant variability in our
investment results and net income and may have a material adverse effect on shareholders' equity. Additionally, our equity
investment portfolio is concentrated, and declines in the value of these significant investments could have a material adverse effect
on our financial results and on our ability to carry out our business plans. Equity securities were 64% and 58% of our shareholders' equity at
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity securities have historically produced higher returns than fixed maturity securities over long
periods of time; however, investing in equity securities may result in significant variability in investment returns from one period to the next. In
volatile financial markets, we could experience significant declines in the fair value of our equity investment portfolio, which would result in a
material decrease in net income and shareholders' equity. Our equity portfolio is concentrated in particular issuers and industries and, as a result, a
decline in the fair value of these concentrated investments also could result in a material decrease in net income and shareholders' equity. A material
decrease in shareholders' equity may have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our business plans.
Access to Capital
We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. To the
extent that cash flows generated by our operations are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, or that our capital position is adversely
impacted by a decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio, losses from catastrophe events or otherwise, we may need to raise additional
funds through financings or curtail our growth. We also may be required to liquidate fixed maturity securities or equity securities, which may result in
realized investment losses. Any further sources of capital, including capacity needed for letters of credit, if available at all, may be on terms that are
unfavorable to us. Our access to additional sources of capital will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of
credit, the availability of credit to the industries in which we operate, our results of operations, financial condition, credit ratings and credit capacity,
as well as pending litigation or regulatory investigations. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and letter of credit facilities is
contingent on our compliance with the covenants and other requirements under those facilities. Similarly, our access to capital may be impaired if
regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our inability to obtain adequate capital when needed could have a
negative impact on our ability to invest in, or take advantage of opportunities to expand, our businesses, such as possible acquisitions or the creation
of new ventures, and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms acceptable to us. Any of these effects could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
A failure to comply with covenants and other requirements under our credit facilities, senior debt and other indebtedness could
have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements and indentures relating to our credit facilities, senior debt and other indebtedness,
including letter of credit facilities used by certain of our subsidiaries, contain covenants and other requirements. If we fail to comply with those
covenants or requirements, the lenders, noteholders or counterparties under those agreements and indentures could declare a default and demand
immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them. In addition, where applicable, our lenders may cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters
of credit or require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral. A default under one debt agreement may also put us at risk of a cross-
default
10K - 28

under other debt agreements or other arrangements. Any of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.
Our liquidity and our ability to meet our debt and other obligations, and pay dividends on our preferred stock, depend on the receipt
of funds from our subsidiaries. We are a holding company, and as a result, our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt and other obligations,
and pay dividends on our preferred stock, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments
by our subsidiaries to us. The payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries, which account for a significant portion of our operating cash flows,
may require prior regulatory notice or approval or may be restricted by capital requirements imposed by regulatory authorities. Similarly, our
insurance subsidiaries may require capital contributions from us to satisfy their capital requirements. In addition, our reinsurance contracts typically
allow the cedent, upon a reduction in an insurance company's capital in excess of specified amounts, to terminate its contract on terms
disadvantageous to us or to exercise other remedies that may adversely affect us. Those contract provisions may have the effect of limiting
distributions by our insurance subsidiaries to us.
Risks Related to All of Our Operations
Legal and Regulatory Risks
The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses are extensive. Failure to comply could have a material adverse
effect on us. Each of our businesses is highly dependent on the ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of financial and operational
activities, including, among others, insurance underwriting, claim processing, investment activities, the management of third-party capital and
providing products and services to businesses and consumers, many of which are highly complex. These activities are subject to internal guidelines
and policies, as well as legal and regulatory requirements, including, among others, those related to privacy and data security, economic and trade
sanctions, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and global finance and investments, customer protection and insurance matters. Our continued expansion into
new businesses, distribution channels and markets brings about additional requirements. While we believe that we have adopted adequate and
effective risk management and compliance programs, compliance risks remain, particularly as we become subject to additional rules and regulations.
Failure to comply with, or to obtain, appropriate authorizations or exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on
our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Any such failure
could also subject us to fines, penalties, equitable relief and changes to our business practices. In addition, a failure to comply could result in defaults
under our senior unsecured debt agreements or credit facilities or damage our businesses or our reputation.
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is personnel- and systems-intensive. Shareholder activism, the current political environment, and
the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial and complex new regulations and compliance
obligations. Any changes in, or the enactment of new, laws and regulations may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we
operate, which could materially increase our direct and indirect costs for compliance and other expenses of doing business, and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, failure to implement data management and security controls in the
use of artificial intelligence by us or third party providers may subject us to data privacy, intellectual property and general regulatory risk, particularly
in light of emerging regulation on the use of artificial intelligence.
Losses from legal and regulatory actions may have a material adverse effect on us. From time to time we may be involved in various legal
actions, including at times multi-party or class action litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. A significant
unfavorable outcome in one or more of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are
also involved from time to time in various regulatory actions, investigations and inquiries, including market conduct exams by insurance regulatory
authorities. If a regulatory authority takes action against us or we enter into a consent order or agreement to settle a matter, a regulatory authority
has the option to require us to pay substantial fines or implement remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our businesses and
operations. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, these matters could have an adverse impact on our reputation and result in
substantial expense and disruption. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 and Item 3 Legal
Proceedings.
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions and bribery and corruption, the violation of which
could have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with the economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs
administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies
worldwide, as well as applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. In some
cases, we must comply with many new
10K - 29

economic, financial and trade sanctions that are imposed over a short period of time, as occurred with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. A violation of a
sanction, embargo program, or anti-corruption law could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as
significant civil and criminal penalties. In addition, a violation could result in defaults under our outstanding indebtedness or credit facilities or
damage our businesses or our reputation. Those penalties or defaults, or damage to our businesses or reputation, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, the requirements and limitations applicable to the global operations of U.S.
companies and their affiliates are more restrictive than, and may even conflict with, those applicable to non-U.S. companies and their affiliates, which
also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. We run the risk of
misconduct by employees across our businesses. Instances of misconduct, fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to
obtain proper internal authorization, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses or reputational
damage. It is not always possible to detect, deter or prevent employee errors or misconduct or fraud, and the controls and trainings that we have in
place to mitigate these activities may not be sufficient or effective in all cases.
Global Operations
We manage our global operations through a network of business entities, which could result in inconsistent management,
governance and oversight practices. We manage our global operations through a network of business entities located in the U.S., Bermuda, the
U.K., Europe, Canada, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. These business entities are managed by executives, and supported by shared and
centralized services; however, for certain of our businesses, subsidiary-level management is responsible for day-to-day operations, profitability,
personnel decisions, the growth of the business, and legal and regulatory compliance, including adherence to applicable local laws. Operating
through subsidiary-level management can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global
operations. In addition, some of our business entities operate with management, sales, and support personnel that may be insufficient to support
growth in their respective locations and industries, without significant central oversight and coordination. We continue to enhance our management,
governance and oversight procedures to effectively support, and improve transparency throughout, our global operations and network of business
entities; however, our operating strategy nonetheless could result in inconsistent management, governance, and oversight practices, which may
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We have substantial international operations and investments, which expose us to increased political, civil, operational and
economic risks. A substantial portion of our revenues and income is derived from our operations and investments outside the U.S., including from
the U.K., Bermuda, Europe, Canada, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Our international operations and investments expose us to increased
political, civil, operational and economic risks. Deterioration or volatility in foreign and international financial markets or general economic and
political and civil conditions could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Concerns about the economic conditions,
capital markets, political, civil and economic stability and solvency of certain countries may contribute to global market volatility. Political and civil
changes in the jurisdictions where we operate and elsewhere, some of which may be disruptive, can also interfere with our customers and our
activities in a particular location. Our international operations also may be subject to a number of additional risks, particularly in emerging
economies, including restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-
competitive governmental actions or requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
General economic, market or industry conditions could lead to investment losses, adverse effects on our businesses and limit our
access to the capital markets. General economic and market conditions and industry specific conditions, including extended economic recessions
or expansions; prolonged periods of slow economic growth; inflation or deflation; fluctuations and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity and energy prices and interest rates; volatility in the credit and capital markets; changes in U.S. government debt ratings; the imposition
of tariffs and other changes in international trade regulation and other factors, could lead to: substantial realized and unrealized investment losses in
future periods; declines in demand for, or increased frequency and severity of claims made under, our insurance products; disruptions in global
supply chains and increased costs of inputs for our products and services; reduced demand for our services and the products we sell and distribute;
changes in the carrying value of our other assets and liabilities; and limited or no access to the capital markets. Any of these impacts could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, debt and financial strength ratings or our insurance subsidiaries' capital.
Markel Ventures businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by increased costs of labor and materials and declines in demand
for certain products and services due to
10K - 30

economic and industry specific conditions. Our efforts to mitigate these impacts may not be successful and, even when they are successful, there
may be a time lag before the impacts of these efforts are reflected in our results.
Our businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by ongoing regional or military conflicts
and related disruptions in the global economy. The global economy has been, and may in the future be, negatively impacted by regional or
military conflicts, for example, the on-going conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas. We may have operations in areas
affected by a conflict, and some of our businesses may be adversely affected by a conflict and its effects. Within our underwriting operations, we may
have insurance contracts with exposure to losses attributed to a conflict. Our other operations also may have direct exposure to customers and
vendors in an affected area. Certain of our businesses may experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw
materials due in part to the negative impact of a conflict on the global economy.
Furthermore, governments in the U.S., U.K., and European Union, among others, may impose export controls on certain products and financial and
economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in affected areas. These export controls and sanctions, or our failure to comply with them,
could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business or have the other adverse
effects discussed above under this Item 1A. Risk Factors under "We are subject to laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions and
bribery and corruption, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us."
We are unable to predict the impact an ongoing conflict may have on our businesses or the global economy. The impact of geopolitical tensions
related to these conflicts, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, is unknown and could result in, among other things,
heightened cybersecurity threats, supply disruptions, protracted or increased inflation, increased energy costs, lower consumer demand, fluctuations
in interest and foreign exchange rates and increased volatility in financial markets, any of which could adversely affect our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, an ongoing conflict may have the effect of triggering or intensifying many of the risks described under
this Item 1A Risk Factors under Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations, Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments and Access to
Capital, and Risks Related to All of Our Operations.
Acquisitions, Integration and Reliance on Management and Personnel
The integration of acquired businesses may not be as successful as we anticipate. We have completed, and expect to complete,
acquisitions in an effort to achieve profitable growth in our underwriting and other insurance operations and to create additional value on a
diversified basis in our Markel Ventures operations. Acquisitions present operational, regulatory, strategic and financial risks, as well as risks
associated with liabilities arising from the previous operations of the acquired businesses. We also must make decisions about the degree to which
we integrate acquisitions into our existing businesses, operations and systems, and over what timeframe. Those decisions may adversely affect how
successfully the acquired businesses perform, both in the short-term and in the long-term. All of these risks are magnified in the case of a large
acquisition. Integration of the operations, systems and personnel of acquired businesses may prove more difficult than anticipated, which may result
in failure to achieve financial objectives associated with the acquisition or diversion of management attention and other resources. In addition,
integration of formerly privately-held companies into the management and internal control and financial reporting systems of a publicly-held
company presents additional risks. See note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for information about our
recent acquisitions.
Impairment in the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
financial condition. As of December 31, 2023, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $4.2 billion and represented 28% of shareholders' equity. We
record goodwill and intangible assets at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid to acquire
businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Declines in operating results, divestitures,
sustained market declines and other factors that impact the fair value of a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible
assets and, in turn, a charge to net income. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Developments that adversely affect the future cash flows or earnings of an acquired business may cause the goodwill or intangible assets recorded
for it to be impaired. See "Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill and Intangible Assets" included under Item 7 Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for
information about our goodwill and intangible assets.
10K - 31

The loss of, or failure to successfully implement succession planning for, one or more key executives or an inability to attract and
retain qualified personnel in our various businesses could have a material adverse effect on us. Our success depends on our ability to
retain the services of our existing key executives, implement successful succession planning and attract and retain additional qualified personnel in
the future. The temporary or permanent loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified
personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct or grow our business.
Additionally, in our decentralized business model, we rely on qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized
business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage
changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and
competent personnel to execute business plans and serve their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit, train and retain
qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries
and Markel Group as a whole.
Information Technology Systems and Third-Party Systems and Service Providers
Information technology systems that we use could fail or suffer a security breach or cyberattack, which could have a material
adverse effect on us or result in the loss of regulated or sensitive information. Our businesses are dependent upon the operational
effectiveness and security of our enterprise systems and those maintained by third parties. Among other things, we rely on these systems to interact
with producers, insureds, customers, clients, and other third parties, to perform actuarial and other modeling functions, to underwrite business, to
prepare policies and process premiums, to process claims and make claims payments, to prepare internal and external financial statements and
information, as well as to engage in a wide variety of other business activities. A significant failure of our enterprise systems, or those of third parties
upon which we may rely, whether because of a natural disaster, network outage or a cyberattack on those systems, including ransomware, could
compromise our personal, confidential and proprietary information as well as that of our customers and business partners, impede or interrupt our
business operations and could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and
fines, litigation and monetary and reputational damages. In addition, if we are unable to innovate, develop and acquire new technology, it may leave
us more susceptible to these attacks. Like other companies, we have been subject to cyberattacks, malicious viruses and malware, and denial of
service attacks and expect that this will continue in the future with greater sophistication and frequency. Despite any controls or protective actions
we take against such attacks, those measures may be insufficient to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, a natural disaster, network outage or a
cyberattack on our systems. This could result in liability to us, cause our data to be corrupted or stolen and cause us to commit resources to correct
those failures.
In addition, we are subject to numerous data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations enacted in the jurisdictions in which we do business. A
misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer, business partner, employee or
third party could damage our businesses or our reputation or result in significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and
criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the European General Data Protection Regulation there are significant
punishments for non-compliance which could result in a penalty of up to 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a violation of data privacy
laws and regulations could result in defaults under our outstanding indebtedness or credit facilities. Those monetary damages, penalties, regulatory
or legal actions or defaults, or the damage to our businesses or reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. Third parties who we utilize to perform certain functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws
and regulations also could damage our businesses or reputation or result in regulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
Further, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other digital means. Although we
attempt to protect this personal, confidential and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so in all cases, especially with business partners
and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential and proprietary information.
While we maintain cyber risk insurance providing first-party and third-party coverages, that insurance may not cover all costs associated with the
consequences of an enterprise failure, cyberattack, or breach of systems. A material cyber security breach could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
10K - 32

Third-party providers may perform poorly, breach their obligations to us or expose us to enhanced risks. Certain of our business
functions are performed by third-party providers, and these providers may not perform as expected or may fail to adhere to the obligations owed to
us. For example, certain of our business units rely on relationships with a number of third-party administrators under contracts pursuant to which
these third-party administrators manage and pay claims on our behalf and advise us with respect to case reserves. In these relationships, we rely on
controls incorporated in the provisions of the administration agreement, as well as on the administrator's internal controls, to manage the claims
process within our prescribed parameters. In addition, certain of our business units use managing general agents, general agents and other
producers to write and administer business on our behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities. Although we monitor these administrators,
agents, producers and other service providers on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate, or our service providers could
exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, which could result in operational disruption, reputational damage and regulatory
intervention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
In addition, we utilize third parties to perform certain technology and business process functions, such as data center hosting, cloud based operating
environments, human resources and other outsourced services. If these third-party providers do not perform as expected, we may experience
operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business, or we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies. Our
use of third parties to perform certain technology and business process functions may expose us to risks related to privacy and data security,
including through their use of artificial intelligence without our knowledge or below our standards, which could result in monetary and reputational
damages. We may be further exposed to risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology if third-party service providers
or any counterparts, where known or unknown to us, use such technology in their business activities. In addition, our ability to receive services from
third-party providers might be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including political and civil instability, supply chain disruptions, volatility or
disruptions in the financial markets, wide-spread health issues, unanticipated or additional regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability
to conduct our businesses may be adversely affected.
Pandemics
Pandemics have had, and could have, material adverse effects on us. The effects of a pandemic, and related governmental responses, may
be wide-ranging, costly, disruptive and rapidly changing, resulting in material adverse effects on our underwriting, investment, Markel Ventures and
other operations, and on our results of operations and financial condition, as was the case with COVID-19. Factors that give rise, or may give rise, to
those effects include, or may include, the following, as well as others that we cannot predict:
• Insured or reinsured losses from pandemic-related claims that are different, or more extensive, than we expect;
• Government actions or judicial decisions related to insurance or reinsurance coverages or rates, including, for example, requiring retroactive
coverage of claims or expanding the scope of coverage;
• Disputes, lawsuits and other legal actions challenging the promptness of coverage determinations, or the coverage determinations
themselves, under applicable insurance or reinsurance policies, resulting in increased claims, litigation and related expenses;
• Disruptions, delays and increased costs and risks related to having limited or no access to our facilities, workplace re-entry, employee safety
concerns and reductions or interruptions of critical or essential services;
• Continually changing business conditions and compliance obligations; and
• Short or long-term impacts on the cost, availability or timeliness of required raw materials, supplies or services provided by third parties,
including services provided by state, federal or foreign governments or government agencies.
In addition, a pandemic may, as has been the case with COVID-19, have the effect of triggering or intensifying many of the risks described elsewhere
under this Item 1A. Risk Factors under Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations, Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments and Access to
Capital, and Risks Related to All of Our Operations.

Climate Change
The impacts of climate change, and legal or regulatory measures to address climate change, may adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition. Our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition could be impacted by risks associated with
climate change, including:
• changes from legislation, regulation and court decisions that:
◦ create economic and regulatory uncertainty,
◦ increase our compliance costs,
◦ impose liability on or increase exposure for our policyholders not contemplated during our underwriting,
◦ change our ability to provide insurance coverage to certain policyholders, or
◦ impose new or additional requirements that increase the costs associated with, or disrupt, sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution
of, our products and services,
• changes in the frequency, severity, and location of weather-related catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornados, windstorms, floods, wildfires,
and other extreme weather events, which may:
◦ result in insured losses that exceed our expectations or make it more difficult for us to predict and model catastrophic events,
reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate our risks,
◦ make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain reinsurance at desired levels, or
◦ increase physical risks to and impacts on our operations,
• changing demand for insurance coverage we provide, such as demand from industries that produce or use carbon-based energy including
those transitioning from those energy sources, decreased availability of reinsurance available for coverages we provide for carbon intensive
industries, or increased claims and losses related to those industries, and
• losses on our invested assets, including from:
◦ changes in supply and demand,
◦ advances in low-carbon technology and renewable energy development,
◦ effects of extreme weather events on the physical and operational exposure of industries and issuers, and
◦ the transition that companies make towards addressing climate risk in their own businesses.

Markel participates in the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center to share information about the latest cyber threats and
preparedness measures. Markel also shares threat intelligence information with other partners. Markel has a cybersecurity incident response plan, as
well as a crisis management plan, that cover cyber events, including a process for determining the materiality of cyber events that includes
evaluation by a cross functional crisis management group including security, information technology, finance, legal and business and escalation to
Markel Group senior management as warranted by the severity of the situation. An internal team engages in tabletop exercises several times each
year to enhance preparedness for such situations.
Information security and data protection risks are the responsibility of all employees. Markel has a mandatory training program covering a variety of
security and data protection disciplines. In addition, all Markel employees are required to acknowledge annually policies on acceptable use of
Markel's technology resources and enterprise information security. Contractors are required to provide certain representations and certifications
relating to information security.
The Markel information security and data protection program is led by a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who supervises a team of security
and data protection professionals across the globe. Markel's global information security and data protection program leverages the Cybersecurity
Framework from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as well as industry best practices. Markel also is able to map to both ISO
(International Organization for Standardization) and BSI (British Standards Institution) among other cybersecurity standards. Markel's CISO has been
with Markel 13 years and has 22 years' experience in information technology, with 17 years in information technology security, and is a certified
Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
Markel Ventures
Each of our Markel Ventures businesses maintains its own, separate IT infrastructure, that often includes third-party providers, to support the needs
of its business. As a result, cybersecurity risk for the Markel Ventures businesses is not concentrated in one system or service provider. Further, given
the disparate nature of the businesses, systems, and providers, there is no single, uniform approach to managing cybersecurity risk at the Markel
Ventures businesses – each is tailored to its unique needs. As is the case with all risks, management for each Markel Ventures business is responsible
for evaluating and managing cybersecurity risks for its business. Therefore, each business determines the appropriate IT systems and providers
needed to do so. Management for each business shares information on material risks from cybersecurity incidents with Markel Ventures
management.
Markel Ventures has established processes for the Markel Ventures businesses to share information about how they assess, identify, and manage
cybersecurity risk and shares information on material risks from cybersecurity incidents with Markel Group management, as appropriate. Each Markel
Ventures business has a board that meets quarterly. Material matters regarding cybersecurity risk management and cybersecurity incidents are
discussed at these meetings. In addition, Markel Ventures management regularly meets with the businesses to discuss their risk identification,
assessment, and management approach. These discussions include how the business assesses, identifies, and manages key risks, including
cybersecurity risks.
Markel Ventures requires real-time reporting of material cybersecurity incidents to understand how the matters are being managed, assess whether
public disclosure is required and inform Markel Group senior management of relevant matters. Depending on the cybersecurity incident, third parties
may be engaged by the Markel Ventures businesses to assist them in understanding and managing the event.
Given the varying size and complexity of the Markel Ventures businesses, a diverse array of individuals assume responsibility for managing
cybersecurity risks within them. In some instances, primary responsibility may be with a member of the executive management team. In other
instances, primary responsibility may land with information technology professionals. In all instances, however, ultimate responsibility rests with each
business' Chief Executive Officer.
Markel Group Board Oversight
The Markel Group Board of Directors oversees Markel Group's risk management framework on an enterprise-wide basis, which includes cybersecurity
risks. Periodic reports are provided to the Markel Group Board of Directors by members of management which, among other things, seek to
systematically identify the principal risks facing our businesses and the manner in which such risks are addressed. For cybersecurity, this includes a
review of the cybersecurity program and its governance, active and planned initiatives, protection and prevention matters, detection and response
measures, and the threat landscape.

Cybersecurity Risks
No previous cybersecurity incident has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on Markel Group, its business strategy, results of
operations, or financial condition. For risks related to cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A Risk Factors, including under "Information technology
systems that we use could fail or suffer a security breach or cyberattack, which could have a material adverse effect on us or result in the loss of
regulated or sensitive information."
Item 2. PROPERTIES
We lease office space in Glen Allen, Virginia for our Markel Group corporate headquarters, which also serves as the headquarters for our insurance
and Markel Ventures operations. Our insurance operations lease office space throughout the U.S. and in various locations in other countries. In total,
we have 64 insurance offices in 17 countries. Additionally, our Markel Ventures businesses maintain office space, factories and warehouses, both
through leased and owned properties, throughout the U.S. and in certain international locations. The property needs of our Markel Ventures
businesses vary based on the nature of the operations of each business. We believe our properties are suitable and adequate for our current
operations.
Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation
In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of Aspen Holdings, Inc. (Aspen). As part of the consideration for that acquisition, Aspen shareholders
received contingent value rights (CVRs). Prior to the December 31, 2017 CVR maturity date, the CVR holder representative, Thomas Yeransian,
disputed our prior estimation of the value of the CVRs. On September 15, 2016, Mr. Yeransian filed a suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation
(U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware), alleging, among other things, that we are in default under the CVR agreement. The suit seeks: $47.3
million in damages, which represents the unadjusted value of the CVRs; plus interest ($29.1 million through December 31, 2023) and default interest
(up to an additional $24.4 million through December 31, 2023, depending on the date any default occurred); and an unspecified amount of punitive
damages, costs, and attorneys' fees.
At the initial hearing held February 21, 2017, the court stayed the proceedings and ordered the parties to discuss resolving the dispute pursuant to
the independent CVR valuation procedure under the CVR agreement. The parties met on April 5, 2017, but were unsuccessful in reaching agreement
on a process for resolving the dispute. We subsequently filed a motion to stay the litigation and compel arbitration, and, on July 31, 2017, the court
issued an order granting that motion.
On November 13, 2018, Mr. Yeransian filed a second suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation (U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware),
which also alleges that the Company is in default under the CVR agreement. The second suit seeks the same monetary damages and relief as the
original suit. We filed a motion to stay this suit until the arbitration for the original suit had concluded and the CVR holders received the final amount
due under the CVR Agreement. The court granted that motion on August 6, 2019.
On June 5, 2020, Mr. Yeransian filed a third suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation (U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware). Similar to
the first and second suits, the third suit alleges that the Company is in default under the CVR agreement and, in addition, has interfered with the
arbitration for the CVR valuation. The third suit seeks the same monetary damages and relief as the original suit and the second suit, as well as other
declaratory and non-monetary judgments and orders. We filed a motion to stay this suit, which the court granted on March 16, 2021.
Under the arbitration terms of the CVR Agreement, independent experts were appointed to determine the final value of the CVRs. On September 20,
2021, the experts delivered their report indicating a final CVR valuation of $22.4 million, excluding interest. We had previously paid $8.0 million to
the CVR holders, representing 90% of the undisputed value of the CVRs, plus interest of $1.9 million. On September 20, 2021, we paid $20.1 million,
which represents $14.1 million for the unpaid portion of the final CVR amount (excluding fees payable to a third party), plus $6.0 million in additional
interest.
The stay was lifted on each pending suit, and the three suits were consolidated. On June 8, 2023, the court ruled in favor of the Company and against
Mr. Yeransian on all counts. Mr. Yeransian has appealed the court's decision.
We believe Mr. Yeransian's suits to be without merit. We further believe that any material loss resulting from the suits to be remote.

The following graph compares the cumulative total return (based on share price) on our common stock with the cumulative total return of companies
included in the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Property & Casualty Insurance Companies Index. We are a holding
company comprised of a diverse group of businesses and investments, and we believe there are few companies with a mix of business operations
comparable to ours. Our principal business markets and underwrites specialty insurance products, and therefore, we have used the Dow Jones U.S.
Property & Casualty Insurance Companies Index as our peer group. However, we also own controlling interests in a diverse portfolio of businesses
that operate in a variety of other industries. This information is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Insurance Results
Our Insurance engine includes our underwriting, program services and other fronting and insurance-linked securities (ILS) operations. We have a
suite of capabilities through which we can access capital to support our customers' risks, which includes our own capital through our underwriting
operations and third-party capital through our program services and other fronting and ILS operations. Our underwriting operations, which are
primarily comprised of our Insurance and Reinsurance segments, produce revenues primarily by underwriting insurance contracts and earning
premiums in the specialty insurance market. Our program services and other fronting and insurance-linked securities operations produce revenues
primarily through fees earned for fronting services and investment management services, respectively. Our insurance operations also include the
underwriting results of run-off lines of business that were discontinued prior to, or in conjunction with, insurance acquisitions,
10K - 41

and the results of our run-off life and annuity reinsurance business. The following table presents the components of our Insurance engine gross

Underwriting Results
Underwriting profits are a key component of our strategy to build shareholder value. The property and casualty insurance industry commonly defines
underwriting profit or loss as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. We
use underwriting profit or loss and the combined ratio as a basis for evaluating our underwriting performance. The U.S. GAAP combined ratio is a
measure of underwriting performance and represents the relationship of incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and
insurance expenses to earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The loss ratio represents the
relationship of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums. The expense ratio represents the relationship of underwriting,
acquisition and insurance expenses to earned premiums. A combined ratio less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while a combined ratio
greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss.
In addition to the U.S. GAAP combined ratio, loss ratio and expense ratio, we also evaluate our underwriting performance using measures that
exclude the impacts of certain items on these ratios. We believe these adjusted measures, which are non-GAAP measures, provide financial
statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise our underwriting results and how management evaluates
underwriting performance.
When analyzing our combined ratio, we exclude current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to natural catastrophes and
certain other significant, infrequent loss events, for example, the on-going military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Due to the unique characteristics of these events, there is inherent variability as to the timing or loss amount,
which cannot be predicted in advance. We believe measures that exclude the effects of such events are meaningful to understand the underlying
trends and variability in our underwriting results that may be obscured by these items.
When analyzing our loss ratio, we evaluate losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the current accident year separate from losses and
loss adjustment expenses attributable to prior accident years. Prior accident year reserve development, which can either be favorable or unfavorable,
represents changes in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to loss events that occurred in prior years. We believe a
discussion of current accident year loss ratios, which exclude prior accident year reserve development, is helpful since it provides more insight into
estimates of current underwriting performance and excludes changes in estimates related to prior year loss reserves. We also analyze our current
accident year loss ratio excluding losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to catastrophes and, in 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The
current accident year loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and other significant, infrequent loss events is also commonly referred to as an
attritional loss ratio within the property and casualty insurance industry.

Premiums
The increase in gross premium volume in our underwriting operations in 2023 was driven by growth within our Insurance segment, partially offset by
lower gross premium volume within our Reinsurance segment. Net retention of gross premium volume for our underwriting operations was 82% in
2023 compared to 83% in 2022. The decrease was driven by lower retention in 2023 compared to 2022 across both of our underwriting segments.
Within our underwriting operations, we purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage our net retention on individual risks and
overall exposure to losses and to enable us to write policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. The increase in earned premiums in
2023 was primarily attributable to higher gross premium volume in recent periods.
Throughout 2023, we achieved an overall modest rate increase across the landscape of our diversified product portfolio. However, rate trends by
product class were more divergent in 2023 in contrast to the past few years, where we experienced rate increases across most of our product lines.
These more nuanced rate trends, coupled with increases in loss cost trends due to heightened economic and social inflation, have forced us to
examine each of our product classes more closely and target premium growth only in product lines where we are most confident in the levels of rate
adequacy.
During 2023, we achieved significant rate increases on our property coverages and select marine and energy product lines, due to recent industry
loss experience and the increasing cost of obtaining reinsurance protection, which led us to pursue opportunistic growth within these product lines.
Additionally, within our general liability product lines, we continued to achieve modest rate increases across most product classes and saw the level
of rate increases improve over the course of the year. We maintained modest growth in these product lines, while carefully selecting risks, managing
limits and adjusting attachment points in response to heightened loss cost trends within general liability lines.
Within our insurance and reinsurance professional liability product lines, overall, we saw modest rate decreases driven by notable rate decreases
within our public directors and officers product, consistent with broader trends across the industry, and,
10K - 43

to a lesser extent, within our errors and omissions coverages. Within these products, we are contracting our new premium writings when we believe
rates are inadequate and are also allowing business to lapse. In other professional liability product lines, particularly within our international portfolio,
we are generally seeing consistency in rates and are continuing to pursue growth opportunities where we find the business to be adequately priced.
We also saw rate decreases globally within our cyber product line as that market matures, following several years of significant rate increases and
strong industry underwriting performance. Despite these current trends, we view cyber as a long-term growth opportunity. Finally, we continued to
realize low single digit rate decreases within our workers' compensation product line and are reacting accordingly on a state-by-state basis to
maintain profitability.
Combined Ratio
In 2023, underwriting results included $40.1 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane
Idalia (2023 Catastrophes). The net losses and loss adjustment expenses from the 2023 Catastrophes were net of ceded losses of $9.3 million. In
2022, underwriting results included $46.2 million and $35.7 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to Hurricane Ian and the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. The net losses and loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine conflict were net of
ceded losses of $115.3 million and $44.3 million, respectively. Excluding these losses, the increase in our consolidated combined ratio in 2023
compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a higher attritional loss ratio across both of our underwriting segments.

Premiums
The increase in gross premium volume in our Insurance segment in 2023 was driven by more favorable rates and new business growth across many
of our product lines, most notably within our personal lines and property product lines. The increase was partially offset by lower premium volume
within select lines of our professional liability and general liability product lines, where we are adjusting our writings in response to changes in market
conditions and downward pressure on rates. We continue to focus on rate adequacy, particularly within certain classes of our casualty and
professional liability product lines, and will not write business that we believe will not meet our underwriting profit targets.
10K - 44

Net retention of gross premium volume was 81% in 2023 compared to 82% in 2022. The decrease was driven by higher cession rates on our personal
lines product lines in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in earned premiums in 2023 was primarily due to higher gross premium volume across
most product lines in recent periods.
Combined Ratio
The Insurance segment's current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2023 included $39.6 million of net losses and loss adjustment
expenses attributed to the 2023 Catastrophes. Current accident year losses in 2022 included $46.2 million and $23.0 million of net losses and loss
adjustment expenses attributed to Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. Excluding these losses, the increase in the current
accident year loss ratio in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to higher attritional loss ratios within our general liability and
professional liability product lines in 2023 compared to 2022. Based on the adverse prior accident year loss development trends on these long-tail
lines of business and the uncertainty around future loss cost trends, as discussed in further detail below, we increased our attritional loss ratios on
certain product classes within our general liability and professional liability product lines in 2023. Consistent with our loss reserving philosophy and to
increase the likelihood that the reserves established for our in-force portfolio will ultimately prove to be adequate, we are taking a more cautious
approach in our reserving, resulting in higher attritional loss ratios on this business.
Additionally, we recognized losses on our intellectual property collateral protection insurance written within our professional liability product line in
2023 due to higher than anticipated levels of claims and loss experience. Losses on this product line also included $65.0 million of credit losses
recognized in connection with fraudulent letters of credit that were provided by an affiliate of Vesttoo Ltd. as collateral for reinsurance purchased on
two policies, which we believe represents our full exposure to credit losses on the related reinsurance recoverables. We are actively pursuing
remedies to make recoveries on the reinsurance recoverables impacted by the fraudulent letters of credit and do not have any other ceded
reinsurance contracts with Vesttoo Ltd. or its affiliates.
The Insurance segment's 2023 combined ratio included $104.7 million of favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was
primarily attributable to favorable development on our property, marine and energy, international professional liability, personal lines and workers'
compensation product lines, partially offset by adverse development on our U.S. and Bermuda general liability and professional liability product lines.
In 2022, the combined ratio included $142.9 million of favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was primarily attributable
to favorable development on our workers' compensation, programs, property and credit and surety product lines. Favorable development in 2022
was partially offset by adverse development on our professional liability and general liability product lines, primarily on our U.S. and Bermuda
business. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for more information on the Insurance segment's prior
year loss reserve development.
Net favorable development in 2022 was net of $128.5 million, or two points, of adverse development on our U.S. and Bermuda professional liability
and general liability product lines, which was primarily attributable to unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity on
the 2016 to 2019 accident years. The adverse development was across a number of products, including directors and officers, errors and omissions
and employment practices liability within professional liability and contractors and excess and umbrella within general liability. Development on prior
years loss reserves within our U.S. and Bermuda professional liability and general liability product lines in 2022 was impacted by broader market
conditions. The impact of economic and social inflation, including the rising cost to adjust and settle claims and the impact of more pervasive
litigation financing trends, has contributed to the loss cost trends, leading to higher than anticipated losses in older accident years for these product
lines. The impacts of social inflation were most significant on our large, risk-managed excess professional liability accounts, corresponding with a
notable rise in the number of class action lawsuits on these years and the recent unfavorable legal environment. The development of this claims
trend was influenced by state and federal court closures following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which delayed court proceedings for
claims on the impacted product lines.
In 2023, we continued to see an increased frequency of large claims and unfavorable loss cost trends on our U.S. and Bermuda general liability and
professional liability product lines. In response to consecutive quarters of adverse loss development, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we conducted an
extensive reserve study on selected general liability and professional liability product lines, which resulted in further increases to our prior accident
year loss reserves. Adverse development in 2023 on our U.S. and Bermuda general liability and professional liability product lines totaled $330.7
million, or five points. This adverse development was most substantial on our primary casualty contractors' liability and excess and umbrella general
liability product lines.
10K - 45

A significant portion of our casualty portfolio is associated with construction business, which has grown meaningfully in recent years. Our study
determined that the ultimate claim reporting tail on certain of our casualty construction lines is likely to be longer than we initially anticipated. Within
our excess and umbrella general liability and risk-managed errors and omissions professional liability books, we determined that there was a greater
than expected propensity for limits below our attachment point to erode, pushing more claims into our layers. Further, reporting of these claims has
lagged historical loss development patterns due to the effect of court closures and claims backlogs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition
to aggressive tactics by the plaintiffs' bar and delayed claims reporting trends. Although we have achieved significant rate increases since 2019 on
many of these lines in response to heightened loss trends, the findings of our study led us to increase our loss development factors, and therefore our
estimate of the ultimate loss ratios, on our primary casualty contractors' liability, excess and umbrella general liability and risk-managed errors and
omissions professional liability product lines. This resulted in significant strengthening of reserves on the impacted lines, including on the 2020 to
2022 accident years where we determined that the incurred loss trends are following a similar loss development trend at the same stage as older
accident years.
Consistent with our reserving philosophy to hold reserves that are more likely to be redundant than deficient, we increased reserves in areas where
there were indications that our reserves may have been deficient, however, in instances where claims trends have been more favorable than we
previously anticipated, we will wait to reduce loss reserves until those trends are observed over additional periods of time. For those lines in which we
strengthened reserves, although we believe the gross and net reserves are adequate based on information available at this time, we continue to
closely monitor reported claims, claim settlements, ceded reinsurance contract attachments and judicial decisions, among other things, and may
adjust our estimates as new information becomes available.
The increase in the Insurance segment's expense ratio in 2023 was primarily due to higher personnel costs, professional fees and other general and
administrative expenses, which were partially offset by the impact of higher earned premiums.

Premiums
The decrease in gross premium volume in our Reinsurance segment in 2023 was driven by significantly lower gross premiums within our professional
liability product lines, primarily attributable to unfavorable premium adjustments in 2023 compared to favorable premium adjustments in 2022,
largely driven by transaction liability business, due to lower volume of deal activity, and the deterioration in the pricing environment on directors and
officers liability. Lower premium volume within professional liability also reflects decreases on renewals, due to decreased exposures and
participation. The decrease in professional liability premium volume was partially offset by higher gross premiums within our marine and energy
product lines due to increases on renewals, arising from increased exposures and more favorable rates, as well as new business. Significant
variability in gross premium volume can be expected in our Reinsurance segment due to individually significant contracts and multi-year contracts.
Net retention of gross premium volume was 92% in 2023 compared to 95% in 2022. The decrease in net retention was driven by changes in mix of
gross premium volume, as our professional liability business is fully retained and our marine and energy business carries a higher cession rate than
the rest of the segment.
The decrease in earned premiums in 2023 was primarily due to less favorable premium adjustments in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable
to our professional liability and credit and surety product lines, and the non-renewal of a large treaty within our workers' compensation product line.
Combined Ratio
The increase in the Reinsurance segment's current accident year loss ratio in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to less favorable premium
adjustments on prior accident years in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily on our professional liability and credit and surety product lines.
The Reinsurance segment's 2023 combined ratio included $57.1 million of adverse development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was
driven by $95.5 million, or nine points, of adverse development on our general liability product lines and $53.7 million, or five points, of adverse
development on our public entity product line, as well as additional exposures recognized on prior accident years related to net favorable premium
adjustments on our general liability product lines. These increases in prior accident year reserves in 2023 were partially offset by favorable
development across several product lines, including our property and workers' compensation product lines, as well as reduced exposures recognized
on prior accident years related to net unfavorable premium adjustments on our professional liability product lines.
Adverse development on our general liability product lines was primarily attributable to large reported loss claims and adverse loss development
trends across multiple accident years. Substantially all of the adverse development on our public entity product line was attributable to a segment of
this business that we discontinued writing in 2020, which experienced an increased frequency of large claims over the past several quarters, most
significantly on the 2014 to 2019 accident years. Adverse development on both our general liability and public entity product lines included notable
strengthening as a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter in response to changes in loss trends observed in the reserve study previously
discussed under "Insurance Segment" and the expectation that those loss trends will ultimately emerge within comparable reinsurance product lines.
In 2022, the combined ratio included $26.1 million of favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was primarily attributable to
favorable development within our property product lines related to natural catastrophes and our credit and surety product lines. Favorable
development on prior years loss reserves in 2022 was partially offset by additional exposures recognized on prior accident years related to net
favorable premium adjustments on our general liability, credit and surety and professional liability product lines.

loss reserve development.

Program Services and Other Fronting
The increase in operating revenues in 2023 was due to modest increases at both our program services business and other fronting operations as a
result of higher gross premium volume in 2023 compared to 2022. The following table summarizes gross premium volume in our program services
and other fronting operations.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 % Change
Program services $ 2,883,737 $ 2,800,273 3 %
Other fronting $ 840,868 $ 553,871 52 %
The increase in gross premium volume within our program services operations in 2023 was attributable to expansion of existing programs and
growth from new programs. The increase in gross premium volume in our other fronting operating in 2023 was driven by expansion of our property
catastrophe programs with Nephila Reinsurers and achieving more favorable rates on this business, as well as growth from a new specialty program
with Nephila Reinsurers.
In June 2023, we sold Independent Specialty Insurance Company, a subsidiary within our program services operations, which resulted in a gain of
$16.9 million.
Insurance-Linked Securities
The decrease in operating revenues and operating expenses in our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations in 2023 was primarily due to the
disposition of our Velocity managing general agent operations in February 2022, which resulted in a gain of $107.3 million, and our Volante managing
general agent operations in October 2022, which resulted in a gain of $118.5 million. Following these sales, our Nephila ILS operations are solely
comprised of our fund management operations. In 2023, the increase in operating revenues within our fund management operations was primarily
due to $31.1 million of management fees recognized upon the release of capital from side pocket reserves. Nephila's net assets under management
were $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2023.
10K - 48

Additionally, in 2022, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million attributable to our Nephila fund management operations. See
note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for more information about this goodwill impairment.
Markel CATCo
In March 2022, we completed a buy-out transaction with Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (Markel CATCo Re) and Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd. (the
Markel CATCo Funds) that provided for an accelerated return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds and resulted in the
consolidation of Markel CATCo Re upon completion of the transaction. In order to complete the transaction, we made $101.9 million in payments, net
of insurance proceeds, to or for the benefit of investors that were recognized as an expense during the first quarter of 2022. See note 17 of the notes
to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our Markel CATCo operations, the buy-out transaction and the consolidation of
Markel CATCo Re.
Investing Results
We measure our investment performance by analyzing net investment income earned on our investment portfolio, which reflects the recurring
interest and dividend earnings on our investment portfolio. We also analyze net investment gains, which include unrealized gains and losses on our
equity portfolio. Based on the potential for volatility in the financial markets, we understand that the level of gains or losses may vary from one
period to the next, and therefore believe that our investment performance is best analyzed over longer periods of time.
The following table summarizes our consolidated investment performance, which consists predominantly of the results of our Investing segment. Net
investment gains or losses in any given period are typically attributable to changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio due to market value
movements. The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments in any given period is typically attributable to changes in
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio due to changes in interest rates during the period.

considers the timing of net purchases and sales.
(3) Other income or losses within our investing operations primarily relate to equity method investments in our investing segment, which are managed separately from the rest
of our investment portfolio.
10K - 49

The increase in net investment income in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher interest income on cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities and
short-term investments due to higher yields during 2023 compared to 2022. Throughout 2023, we increased our allocation of cash to money market
funds in response to increases in short-term interest rates. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased in part due to
higher average holdings of fixed maturity securities in 2023 compared to 2022. See note 4(d) of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included under Item 8 for details regarding the components of net investment income.
Markel Ventures Results
We measure Markel Ventures' results by its operating income, as well as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA). We consolidate the results of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries on a one-month lag, with the exception of significant transactions or events
that occur during the intervening period. The following table summarizes the results from our Markel Ventures segment.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 % Change
Operating revenues $ 4,985,081 $ 4,757,527 5 %
Operating income $ 437,508 $ 325,238 35 %
EBITDA $ 628,483 $ 506,336 24 %
The increase in operating revenues in 2023 was driven by higher revenues at our construction services businesses and transportation-related
businesses, due to a combination of increased demand, higher prices, and growth, as well as increased production at one of our equipment
manufacturing businesses compared to 2022. The increase also reflected a full-year contribution from Metromont, compared to an 11-month
contribution in 2022 following its acquisition. These increases in operating revenues were partially offset by the impact of decreased demand at our
consumer and building products businesses, consulting services businesses and one of our construction services businesses.
The increases in operating income and EBITDA in 2023 were driven by our products businesses, particularly our consumer and building products
businesses, which had higher margins in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, the operating margins at many of our products businesses were impacted
by increased costs of materials, freight and labor, which reflected the impact of broader economic conditions. As conditions stabilized throughout
2023, particularly in regard to materials and freight costs, our operating margins for those businesses improved. The increases in operating income
and EBITDA at many of our businesses were partially offset by the impact of lower revenues and operating margins at one of our construction
services businesses due to decreased demand.
Markel Ventures EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Markel Ventures EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with
U.S. GAAP measures, including operating income, to monitor and evaluate the performance of our Markel Ventures segment. Because EBITDA
excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, it provides an indicator of economic performance that is useful to both management
and investors in evaluating our Markel Ventures businesses as it is not affected by levels of debt, interest rates, effective tax rates or levels of
depreciation or amortization resulting from purchase accounting. The following table reconciles Markel Ventures operating income to Markel Ventures
EBITDA.

Interest Expense, Net Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses) and Income Taxes
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $185.1 million in 2023 compared to $196.1 million in 2022. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to the impact of
the retirement of our 3.625% unsecured senior notes in March 2023 and our 4.9% unsecured senior notes in July 2022. See note 14 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details regarding the retirement of our senior long-term debt.
Net Foreign Exchange Gains (Losses)
Net foreign exchange gains (losses) included in net income (loss) were losses of $90.0 million in 2023 compared to gains of $137.8 million in 2022.
Net foreign exchange gains (losses) are primarily due to the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated insurance reserves to the U.S.
Dollar. The U.S. Dollar moderately weakened against the Euro and British Pound, the predominant foreign currencies within our insurance operations,
during 2023, while it strengthened against the Euro and British Pound in 2022. Pre-tax net foreign exchange gains and losses attributed to changes in
exchange rates on available-for-sale securities supporting our insurance reserves, which are included in the changes in net unrealized gains (losses)
on available-for-sale investments in other comprehensive income (loss), were gains of $74.0 million in 2023 compared to losses of $79.5 million in
2022.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 21% in 2023 compared to 32% in 2022. The effective tax rate for 2022 differs from the effective tax rate for 2023, and the
statutory rate of 21%, due to the impact of various immaterial items resulting in a net tax benefit that was magnified due to the small pre-tax loss in
2022. See note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of our income taxes.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA), which implemented a 15% corporate minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income,
became effective in 2023. The IRA did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows in 2023, and is not
expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in future periods. However, we will continue to
evaluate the impacts of the IRA as additional guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently introduced rules, commonly referred to as Pillar Two, to establish a
15% global corporate minimum tax on large, multi-national enterprises. Certain countries in which we have operations, including the United Kingdom,
have enacted legislation consistent with Pillar Two, which generally became effective on January 1, 2024. Additionally, in response to Pillar Two, in
December 2023, Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (the Bermuda CIT Act) effective January 1, 2025, which imposes a 15%
corporate income tax on certain Bermuda businesses of large, multi-national enterprises. We do not expect Pillar Two or the Bermuda CIT Act to have
a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, however, we will continue to evaluate these tax law changes as
additional guidance is issued by the OECD and relevant tax authorities.

Book value per common share increased 17% from $935.65 at December 31, 2022 to $1,095.95 as of December 31, 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We seek to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and financial leverage for the benefit and protection of our policyholders, creditors and shareholders.
Our consolidated debt to capital ratio was 20% at December 31, 2023 and 24% at December 31, 2022, both of which are within the range of our
target capital structure. The decrease reflects the retirement of our 3.625% unsecured senior notes due March 30, 2023 and an increase in
shareholder's equity, primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of equity securities.
Holding Company
Our holding company had $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion of investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (invested
assets) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and the
retirement of our 3.625% unsecured senior notes due March 30, 2023, partially offset by dividends received from insurance subsidiaries and an
increase in the fair value of equity securities held by our holding company. See note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included
under Item 8 for condensed financial information for our holding company.
The following table presents the composition of our holding company's invested assets.
December 31,
2023 2022
Fixed maturity securities 4 % 4 %
Equity securities 49 % 40 %
Short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 47 % 56 %

After satisfying our interest and principal obligations on our senior long-term debt and paying dividends on our preferred stock when declared by our
Board of Directors, as well as any other holding company obligations, capital at Markel Group is available to, among other things, allocate to our
existing businesses, complete acquisitions, build our portfolio of equity securities or repurchase shares of our common stock.
In November 2023, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that replaced the previous share repurchase program. The
program provides for the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock. The program has no expiration date but may be terminated by the
Board of Directors at any time. As of December 31, 2023, $713.0 million remained available for repurchases under the program.
We may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or repurchase our outstanding senior notes or preferred shares, through open market purchases,
privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Those prepayments, retirements or repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
The holding company has historically primarily relied on dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to meet its obligations. Under the insurance laws of
the various states in which our domestic insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, an insurer is restricted in the amount of dividends it may pay
without prior approval of regulatory authorities. There are also regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that certain of our foreign insurance
subsidiaries may pay based on applicable laws in their respective jurisdictions. At December 31, 2023, our domestic insurance subsidiaries and
Markel Bermuda Limited could pay ordinary dividends of $1.2 billion during the following twelve months under these laws.
In June 2023, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for our corporate revolving credit facility, which provides up to $300 million
of capacity for future acquisitions, investments and stock repurchases, and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. At our
discretion, up to $200 million of the total capacity may be used for letters of credit. We may increase the capacity of the facility by up to $200 million
subject to obtaining commitments for the increase and certain other terms and conditions. Markel Group guaranteed the obligations under the facility
of the insurance subsidiaries that are also parties to the credit agreement. This facility expires in June 2028. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
there were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in our corporate
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2023. To the extent that we are not in compliance with our
10K - 54

covenants, access to the revolving credit facility could be restricted. While we believe this to be unlikely, the inability to access the revolving credit
facility could adversely affect our liquidity. See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further discussion
of our revolving credit facility.
We have access to various capital sources, including dividends from our subsidiaries, holding company invested assets, undrawn capacity under our
revolving credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. We believe we have, or have access to, adequate liquidity to meet our
capital and operating needs, including that which may be required to support the operating needs of our subsidiaries. However, the availability of
these sources of capital and the availability and terms of future financings will depend on a variety of factors. See the "Access to Capital" risk factors
under Item 1A Risk Factors for more discussion regarding our access to capital sources.
Operating Subsidiaries
Insurance
Within our insurance subsidiaries, our primary source of cash inflows is the collection of premiums, and our primary cash outflow is the subsequent
payment of claims, reinsurance costs and operating expenses. Premiums collected by our underwriting operations are invested primarily in short-
term investments and fixed maturity securities. Short-term investments held by our insurance subsidiaries provide liquidity for payment of projected
claims, reinsurance costs and operating expenses. Fixed maturity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries to support our loss reserves and
the eventual payment of claims, and therefore have maturities that generally match the duration of the underlying net loss reserves.
We seek to maintain capital in each of our insurance subsidiaries that exceeds required capital levels, as prescribed by applicable regulators. Capital
held at our insurance subsidiaries beyond that which we anticipate will be needed to cover payment of claims and operating expenses is typically
invested in equity securities, which over the long run, have produced higher returns relative to fixed maturity securities and short-term investments.
At least annually, when capital at an insurance subsidiary exceeds our target levels, it is typically paid to Markel Group in the form of dividends. In
certain instances, an insurance subsidiary may require additional capital to meet our target capital levels. In these instances, Markel Group has
historically contributed capital to the insurance subsidiary to restore capital to our target levels.
In 2023 and 2022, our insurance subsidiaries paid dividends totaling $310.0 million and $130.0 million, respectively, to Markel Group. Additionally, in
2022, as a result of unfavorable market value movements in the public equity markets, the portion of capital held in equity securities at our
insurance subsidiaries declined significantly. Therefore, in order to maintain our target levels of excess capital within the impacted insurance
subsidiaries, our holding company made capital contributions totaling $973.5 million in 2022. There were no capital contributions from our holding
company to our insurance subsidiaries in 2023.
Markel Ventures
Our Markel Ventures operating subsidiaries include a diverse portfolio of businesses in a variety of industries. The nature of the cash inflows and
outflows generated by each of the individual operating businesses varies based on their individual industries and business strategies. In general,
these businesses operate using limited long-term debt and rely primarily on revolving lines of credit for their operational financing needs. Markel
Ventures, Inc. may also provide loans or make contributions to these operating subsidiaries to fund strategic growth investments and projects.
Capital used by Markel Ventures, Inc. to complete acquisitions consists of profits generated by Markel Ventures, as well as capital contributions from
Markel Group and loans from our insurance subsidiaries.
Operating cash flows from our Markel Ventures operations was $568.1 million in 2023 and $260.3 million in 2022. After satisfying the obligations on
their debt, along with any capital expenditures, operating cash flows from our Markel Ventures subsidiaries are available to be allocated across the
Company by Markel Group. Historically, cash flows generated by our Markel Ventures operating subsidiaries have been retained by Markel Ventures,
Inc., at Markel Group's direction, to fund growth opportunities within Markel Ventures or repay loans with our insurance subsidiaries, rather than
making distributions to Markel Group. In 2023 and 2022, Markel Ventures, Inc. repaid $70.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, of principle on
debt with our insurance subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Markel Ventures, Inc.'s outstanding intercompany debt with our insurance
subsidiaries was $738.0 million and $808.1 million, respectively, all of which is guaranteed by Markel Group.
10K - 55

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, redeemable noncontrolling interests attributable to Markel Ventures, Inc. totaled $469.7 million and $523.2
million, respectively, which represents the obligation for Markel Ventures, Inc. to purchase the remaining equity interests in Markel Ventures
businesses that are not wholly owned. Of the total balance at December 31, 2023, $82.6 million is available for redemption in 2024, with the
remainder becoming redeemable between 2025 and 2030.
Various of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries maintain revolving credit facilities or lines of credit, which provide up to $680 million of aggregate
capacity for working capital and other general operational purposes. A portion of the capacity on certain of these credit facilities may be used as
security for letters of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, $169.5 million and $238.1 million, respectively, of borrowings
were outstanding under these credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, all of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants
contained in their respective credit facilities. To the extent our Markel Ventures subsidiaries are not in compliance with their respective covenants,
access to their credit facilities could be restricted, which could adversely affect their operations.
Cash Flows and Invested Assets
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion in 2023 compared to $2.7 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
operating cash flows from Markel Ventures and investments, partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flows from our insurance operations.
Net cash used by investing activities was $2.7 billion in 2023 compared to $1.7 billion in 2022. In 2023, net cash used by investing activities included
net purchases of fixed maturity securities and equity securities of $2.2 billion and $339.7 million, respectively, and net sales of short-term
investments of $202.9 million. In 2022, net cash used by investing activities included net purchases of fixed maturity securities, short-term
investments and equity securities of $959.7 million, $846.0 million and $201.0 million, respectively. In 2022, net cash used by investing activities was
net of $630.0 million of net cash and restricted cash acquired as part of our consolidation of Markel CATCo Re, of which $169.4 million was
subsequently distributed to Markel CATCo investors for shares that were redeemed in conjunction with the buy-out transaction. Cash flow from
investing activities is affected by various factors such as anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, acquisition opportunities and individual
buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of our investment portfolio management.
In 2023, we continued to increase our allocation of cash and short-term investments to fixed maturity securities in response to higher interest rates
and to support our growing underwriting business. Additionally, we increased our purchases of equity securities in 2023.
Invested assets were $30.9 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $27.4 billion at December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of 13% in 2023. The
increase was primarily attributable to operating cash flows, as well as an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio. The following table presents
the composition of our invested assets.
December 31,
2023 2022
Fixed maturity securities 47 % 43 %
Equity securities 31 % 28 %
Short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 22 % 29 %
Total 100 % 100 %
The change in the composition of the investment portfolio from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 reflects our increased allocation of cash
and short-term investments to fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio.
Net cash used by financing activities was $999.7 million in 2023, which included $250.0 million to retire our 3.625% unsecured senior notes due
March 30, 2023. Net cash used by financing activities was $595.3 million in 2022, which included $350.0 million to retire our 4.90% unsecured senior
notes due July 1, 2022. Financing activities in 2023 and 2022 also reflected borrowings and repayments at certain our Markel Ventures businesses,
primarily on revolving lines of credit. Cash of $445.5 million and $290.8 million was used to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2023 and
2022, respectively.

Cash Obligations
As of December 31, 2023, our primary contractual cash obligations were unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, senior long-term debt and
other debt and related interest payments, life and annuity benefits, lease liabilities and purchase obligations. These cash obligations, as presented in
the following table, represent our estimate of total future cash payments and may differ from the corresponding liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet due to present value discounts and other adjustments required for presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table
summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2023 and the estimated amount expected to be paid in 2024.
Total cash obligations as of Cash obligations due in less
(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 than 1 year
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (1) $ 23,616,295 $ 4,860,429
Senior long-term debt and other debt (2) $ 3,823,709 $ 76,150
Interest payments on senior long-term debt and other debt (3) $ 3,264,553 $ 171,515

Lease liabilities (5) $ 809,900 $ 125,845
Purchase obligations (6) $ 388,069 $ 201,809
(1) The actual cash payments for settled claims will vary, possibly significantly, from these estimates. As of December 31, 2023, the average duration of our reserves for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was 3.8 years. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our
loss reserve estimates.
(2) See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on the scheduled maturity of principal payments on our senior long-
term debt and other debt.
(3) Interest expense is accrued in the period incurred and therefore, only a portion of the future interest payments presented in this table represents a liability on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.
(4) There is inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of payments for life and annuity benefits and actual cash payments for settled contracts could vary
significantly from these estimates. We expect $631.3 million of our cash obligation for life and annuity benefits to be paid beyond five years. See note 13 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our estimates for life and annuity benefit reserves.
(5) See note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our lease obligations and the expected timing of future payments.
(6) Purchase obligations are primarily related to open purchase order commitments with subcontractors and suppliers under contracts in our insurance and Markel Ventures
operations.
Restricted Assets and Capital
At December 31, 2023, we had $5.0 billion of invested assets held in trust or on deposit for the benefit of policyholders or ceding companies or to
support underwriting activities. Additionally, we have pledged investments and cash and cash equivalents totaling $450.5 million at December 31,
2023 as security for letters of credit that have been issued by various banks on our behalf. These invested assets and the related liabilities are
included in our consolidated balance sheet. See note 4(f) of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further
discussion of restrictions over our invested assets.
Our insurance operations require capital to support premium writings, and we remain committed to maintaining adequate capital and surplus at each
of our insurance subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) developed a model law and risk-based capital formula
designed to help regulators identify domestic property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized. Under the NAIC's requirements, a
domestic insurer must maintain total capital and surplus above a calculated threshold or face varying levels of regulatory action. Capital adequacy of
our foreign insurance subsidiaries is regulated by applicable laws of the United Kingdom, Bermuda and Germany. At December 31, 2023, the capital
and surplus of each of our insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory
requirements.
10K - 57

Critical Accounting Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that both are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and
require us to exercise significant judgment. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and
liabilities. These estimates, by necessity, are based on assumptions about numerous factors. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates
and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our accounts with accounting policies that involve critical accounting
estimates are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and goodwill and intangible assets.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Our consolidated balance sheets included estimated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $23.5 billion and reinsurance recoverables on
unpaid losses of $8.8 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $20.9 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. Included in these
balances were unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses attributable to our program services
business and other fronting arrangements totaling $5.2 billion as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, consolidated unpaid losses and
loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included $185.0 million and $347.9 million, respectively, of fully
collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re, which we consolidate following the Markel CATCo buy-out. See note 17 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the consolidation of Markel CATCo Re. Our consolidated balance sheets do not include
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliates that we manage through our Nephila
insurance-linked securities operations.
We accrue liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable. We maintain reserves
for specific claims incurred and reported (case reserves) and reserves for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR reserves).
Reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process, and the corresponding reserves for reported claims are based upon all information
available to us. Case reserves consider our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting
from the claims, and may be subject to adjustment for differences between costs originally estimated and costs subsequently re-estimated or
incurred. Claims are settled based upon their merits, and some claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. As of any
balance sheet date, all claims have not yet been reported, and some claims may not be reported for many years. As a result, the liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims.
There is normally a time lag between when a loss event occurs and when it is reported to us. The actuarial methods that we use to estimate losses
have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow us to more accurately estimate
future payments. There is also often a time lag between cedents establishing case reserves or re-estimating their reserves and notifying us of those
new or revised case reserves. As a result, the reporting lag is more pronounced in our reinsurance contracts than in our insurance contracts. On
reinsurance transactions, the reporting lag will generally be 60 to 90 days after the end of a reporting period but can be longer in some cases. There
may also be a more pronounced reporting lag, as well as reliance on third-party claims handling practices and reserve estimates, on insurance
contracts for which we are not the primary insurer and participate only in excess layers of loss. Based on the experience of our actuaries and
management, we select loss development factors and trending techniques to mitigate the difficulties caused by reporting lags. At least annually, we
evaluate our loss development factors and trending assumptions using our own loss data, as well as cedent-specific and industry data, and update
them as needed.
U.S. GAAP requires that IBNR reserves be based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social
and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. IBNR reserves are
calculated by subtracting paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves from estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses.
IBNR reserves were 72% of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2023 compared to 70% at December 31, 2022.

The following table summarizes case reserves and IBNR reserves for our underwriting, program services and other fronting operations, which
excludes $185.0 million and $347.9 million of fully collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re as of December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively. The amounts in the following table exclude the unamortized portion of any fair value adjustments for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses assumed in conjunction with an acquisition and any adjustments to discount reserves.

Each quarter, our actuaries prepare estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on established actuarial
methods. Management reviews these estimates, supplements the actuarial analyses with information provided by claims, underwriting and other
operational personnel and determines its best estimate of loss reserves, which is recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Our procedures
for determining the adequacy of loss reserves at the end of the year are substantially similar to the procedures applied at the end of each interim
period.
Any adjustments to reserves resulting from our interim or year-end reviews, including changes in estimates, are recorded as a component of losses
and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate claims cost are referred to
as unfavorable or adverse development, or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate claims cost are
referred to as favorable development.
Program Services and Other Fronting
For our program services business and other fronting arrangements, case reserves are generally established based on reports received from the
general agents or reinsurers with whom we do business. Our actuaries review the case loss reserve data received for sufficiency, consistency with
historical data and for consistency with other programs we write that have similar characteristics. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are
calculated using either our program experience or, where the program data is not credible, industry experience for similar products or lines of
business. Substantially all of the premium written in our program services business and other fronting arrangements is ceded, and net reserves for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $10.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
Underwriting
For our insurance operations, we are generally notified of insured losses by our insureds, their brokers or the primary insurer in instances in which we
participate in excess layers of insured losses on a contract. Based on this information, we establish case reserves by estimating the expected
ultimate losses from the claim, including any administrative or legal costs associated with settling the claim. Our claims personnel use their
knowledge of the policy provisions and details specific to the claim, along with information provided by internal and external experts, including
underwriters, actuaries and legal counsel, to estimate the expected ultimate losses.
For our reinsurance operations, case reserves are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies or their brokers. For
excess of loss contracts, we are typically notified of insurance losses on specific contracts and record a case reserve for the estimated expected
ultimate losses from the claim. For quota share contracts, we typically receive aggregated claims information and record a case reserve based on
that information. As with insurance business, we evaluate this information and estimate the expected ultimate losses.

Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses can generally be categorized into two distinct groups, short-tail business and long-tail
business. Short-tail business refers to lines of business, such as property, accident and health, automobile, watercraft and marine hull exposures, for
which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. Long-tail business refers to lines of business for which specific losses
take much longer to emerge and may not be known and reported for some time. Given the time frame over which long-tail exposures are ultimately
settled, there is greater uncertainty and volatility in these lines than in short-tail lines of business. Our long-tail coverages consist of most casualty
lines, including professional liability, products liability, general and excess liability and excess and umbrella exposures, as well as workers'
compensation insurance, many of which have been a significant source of growth in premium volume in recent years. Some factors that contribute to
the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business, and thus require a significant degree of judgment in the reserving process, include the effects of
unanticipated levels of economic inflation, the impact of social inflation, the inherent uncertainty as to the length of reporting and payment
development patterns, the possibility of judicial interpretations or legislative changes, including changes in workers' compensation benefit laws, that
might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience and the potential lack of comparability of the underlying data used in performing
loss reserve analyses.
Our ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves. Changes in our estimated ultimate liability for loss reserves generally occur as a
result of the emergence of unanticipated loss activity, the completion of specific actuarial or claims studies or changes in internal or external factors.
We closely monitor new information on reported claims and use statistical analyses prepared by our actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our
recorded reserves. We are required to exercise considerable judgment when assessing the relative credibility of loss development trends. Our
philosophy is to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. This means that we seek to establish loss reserves that will
ultimately prove to be adequate. As a result, if new information or trends indicate an increase in frequency or severity of claims in excess of what we
initially anticipated, we generally respond quickly and increase loss reserves. If, however, frequency or severity trends are more favorable than
initially anticipated, we often wait to reduce our loss reserves until we can evaluate experience in additional periods to confirm the credibility of the
trend. In addition, for long-tail lines of business, trends develop over longer periods of time, and as a result, we give credibility to these trends more
slowly than for short-tail or less volatile lines of business.
Actuarial Methods and Analysis
In establishing our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, our actuaries estimate an ultimate loss ratio, by accident year or
underwriting year, for each of our product lines with input from our underwriting and claims personnel. For product lines in which loss reserves are
established on a underwriting year basis, we have developed a methodology to convert from underwriting year to accident year for financial
reporting purposes. In estimating an ultimate loss ratio for a particular line of business, our actuaries may use one or more actuarial reserving
methods and select from these a single point estimate. To varying degrees, these methods include detailed statistical analysis of past claim
reporting, settlement activity, claim frequency and severity, policyholder loss experience, industry loss experience and changes in market and
economic conditions, policy forms and exposures. The actuarial methods we use include:
Initial Expected Loss Ratio Method – This method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio. The expected loss ratio is selected
utilizing industry data, our historical data, frequency-severity and rate level forecasts and professional judgment.
Paid Loss Development – This method uses historical loss payment patterns to estimate future loss payment patterns. Our actuaries use the
historical loss patterns to develop factors that are applied to current paid loss amounts to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Incurred Loss Development – This method uses historical loss reporting patterns to estimate future loss reporting patterns. Our actuaries use
the historical loss patterns to develop factors that are applied to current reported losses to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Development – This method divides the projection of ultimate losses into the portion that has already been paid
and the portion that has yet to be paid. The portion that has yet to be paid is estimated as the product of three amounts: the premium earned for the
exposure period, the expected loss ratio and the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still unpaid. The expected loss ratio is selected by
considering historical loss ratios, adjusted for any known changes in pricing, loss trends, adequacy of case reserves, changes in administrative
practices and other relevant factors.
10K - 60

Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Development – This method is identical to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss development method, except
that it uses the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still unreported, instead of the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still
unpaid.
Frequency/Severity – Under this method, expected ultimate losses are equal to the product of the expected ultimate number of claims and the
expected ultimate average cost per claim. Our actuaries use historical reporting patterns and severity patterns to develop factors that are applied to
the current reported amounts to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Other Methods – There are certain instances when traditional actuarial methods may not be appropriate for estimating unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses. In these instances, we may employ other actuarial methods.
Each actuarial method has its own set of assumptions and its own strengths and limitations, with no one method being better than the others in all
situations. Our actuaries select the reserving methods that they believe will produce the most reliable estimates for the class of business being
evaluated. Greater judgment may be required when we introduce new product lines or when there have been changes in claims handling practices,
as the statistical data available may be insufficient. In these instances, we may rely upon assumptions applied to similar lines of business, rely more
heavily on industry experience, take into account changes in underwriting guidelines and risk selection or review the impact of changes in claims
reserving practices with claims personnel. Greater judgment also may be required for product lines that experience a low frequency of high severity
claims, particularly when we are reliant on third party case reserve estimates and claims handling practices. In these instances, we may perform
detailed claims reviews, analyzing the characteristics of each individual claim, with input from both actuarial and claims personnel to assess the
adequacy of the case and IBNR reserves on the underlying product line. Our claims personnel use their knowledge of the specific claims along with
internal and external experts, to estimate the expected ultimate losses. While we use our best judgment in establishing our estimate for loss
reserves, applying different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different loss reserve estimates.
A key assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past development patterns will repeat themselves in the future, absent a significant change in
internal or external factors that influence the ultimate cost of our unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Our estimates reflect implicit and
explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of external factors, including economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law,
general economic conditions and recent trends in these factors. Our actuarial analyses are based on statistical analysis but also consist of reviewing
internal factors that are difficult to analyze statistically, including changes in underwriting and claims handling practices, as well as rate changes. In
the London market, and where we act as a reinsurer or participate only in excess layers of insured losses, the timing and amount of information
reported about underlying claims are in the control of third parties. This can also affect estimates and require re-estimation as new information
becomes available.
We cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as pandemics and wars, using the
traditional actuarial methods previously described. In the initial months after a catastrophic event occurs, our actuaries estimate losses and loss
adjustment expenses based on claims received to date, industry loss estimates and output from industry, broker and proprietary models, as well as
analysis of our ceded reinsurance contracts. We may also perform detailed policy and reinsurance contract level reviews. The availability of data from
these procedures varies depending on the timing of the event relative to the point at which we develop our estimate. We also consider loss
experience on historical events that may have similar characteristics to the underlying event and current market conditions, including the level of
economic inflation. In the period shortly after an event occurs, more weight is put on modeling and industry estimates, whereas with the passage of
time, greater reliance is placed on incurred claims data and historical claim patterns. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these
estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. As additional claims are reported and
paid, and industry loss estimates are revised, we incorporate this new information into our analysis and adjust our estimate of ultimate losses and
loss adjustment expenses as appropriate.
Management's Best Estimate
Loss reserves are established at management's best estimate, which is developed using the actuarially calculated point estimate as the starting
point. The actuarial point estimate represents our actuaries' estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the losses that
have occurred at a particular point in time; however, there is inherent uncertainty in the point estimate as it is the expected value in a range of
possible reserve estimates. Similarly, the point estimate for ceded losses is calculated based on the ultimate gross loss amount expected to be paid,
as well as the frequency and severity of the underlying claims, which ultimately determines coverage under the applicable ceded reinsurance
contracts. Therefore, ceded loss estimates are subject to many of the same judgments and assumptions as the gross loss estimates. In some cases,
actuarial
10K - 61

analyses, which are generally based on statistical analysis, cannot fully incorporate all of the subjective factors that affect development of losses. In
other cases, management's perspective of these more subjective factors may differ from the actuarial perspective. Subjective factors influencing the
development of management's best estimate include: the credibility and timeliness of claims and loss information received from cedents and other
third parties; and the impacts of economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, changes in underwriting or claims handling
practices, general economic conditions, the risk of moral hazard and other current and developing trends within the insurance and reinsurance
markets, including the effects of competition. For example, our loss experience in recent years has reflected higher than anticipated levels of
economic inflation, as well as the impacts of social inflation, including the rising cost to adjust and settle claims and the impact of more pervasive
litigation financing trends.
In developing its best estimate of loss reserves, management's philosophy is to establish loss reserves that are more likely to be redundant rather
than deficient, and therefore, will ultimately prove to be adequate. Management's approach to establishing loss reserves typically results in loss
reserves that exceed the calculated actuarial point estimate. Management also considers the range, or variability, of reasonably possible loss
outcomes determined by our actuaries when establishing its best estimate for loss reserves. The actuarial ranges represent our actuaries' estimate of
a likely lowest amount and likely highest amount that could ultimately be paid to settle the losses that have occurred at a particular point in time.
The range determinations are based on estimates and actuarial judgements and are intended to encompass reasonably likely changes in one or more
of the factors that were used to determine the point estimates. Using statistical models, our actuaries establish a range of reasonable reserve
estimates for each of our underwriting segments. Additionally, following an acquisition of insurance operations, acquired reserves initially are
recorded at fair value, and therefore our recorded loss reserves may be closer to the actuarial point estimate until we build total loss reserves that
are consistent with our historic level of confidence. Management's best estimate of net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
exceeded the actuarially calculated point estimate by $683.4 million, or 5.0%, at December 31, 2023, compared to $688.4 million, or 5.8%, at
December 31, 2022.
The difference between management's best estimate and the actuarially calculated point estimate in both 2023 and 2022 is primarily associated with
our long-tail business due to the subjective factors previously described that affect the development of losses. The decrease in 2023 resulted from
significant strengthening of reserves following increases in our actuaries' best estimate of ultimate losses on certain general liability and professional
liability product lines, which management believes already considers the subjective factors that may impact the development of underlying losses on
the impacted product lines. Certain subjective factors, particularly the credibility and timeliness of claims information, are more pronounced within
our reinsurance operations, as previously discussed, and therefore, the percentage difference between management's best estimate and the
actuarially calculated point estimate is more significant in our Reinsurance segment than our Insurance segment.
Changes in Estimates
Loss frequency and loss severity are two key measures of loss activity that often result in adjustments to actuarial assumptions relative to ultimate
loss reserve estimates. Loss frequency measures the number of claims per unit of insured exposure. When the number of newly reported claims is
higher than anticipated, loss reserves are generally increased. Conversely, loss reserves are generally decreased when fewer claims are reported
than expected. Loss severity measures the average size of a claim. When the average severity of reported claims is higher than originally estimated,
loss reserves are typically increased. When the average claim size is lower than anticipated, loss reserves are typically decreased.
Our underwriting results in 2023 included $38.6 million of net favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to $167.4 million in
2022. Favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2023 and 2022 reflected significant favorable loss experience across several product
lines, largely offset by adverse development on certain long-tail general liability and professional liability product lines following the emergence of
multiple factors that impacted the claims and loss trends on those lines.
Favorable development in 2023 was most notable on our property, international professional liability, marine and energy and workers' compensation
product lines. Favorable development in 2022 was most significant on our property and workers' compensation product lines. Favorable development
on our property product lines in 2023 and 2022 was driven by lower loss severity than previously anticipated, as well as net favorable development
on our reserves for natural catastrophes that occurred in prior years. On our workers' compensation product line, the actuarial methods we used
indicated a continued decline in the loss severity trend on prior accident years in 2023 and 2022, consistent with our experience in recent years.
Within our international operations, our professional liability and marine and energy product lines experienced lower loss severity than initially
expected. As actual losses on these product lines continued to be lower than anticipated in 2023 and 2022, it became more likely that the
underwriting results would prove to be better than originally estimated. Management gave greater credibility to the favorable trends experienced on
earlier accident years and upon incorporating these favorable trends
10K - 62

into its best estimate, reduced prior years loss reserves on more recent accident years accordingly. While we believe it is likely that there will be
additional favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2024, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on this favorable trend.
The favorable development in 2023 and 2022 was largely offset by adverse development on certain long-tail general liability and professional liability
product lines. Beginning in the latter half of 2022, select lines within our U.S. and Bermuda general liability and professional liability portfolio were
impacted by consecutive quarters of unfavorable loss cost trends and increased claim frequency and severity, resulting in adverse development on
these lines in both 2023 and 2022.
Net favorable development in 2022 was net of $128.5 million of adverse development on our U.S. and Bermuda professional liability and general
liability product lines within our Insurance segment, which was primarily attributable to unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency
and severity on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. The adverse development was across a number of products, including directors and officers, errors
and omissions and employment practices liability within professional liability and contractors and excess and umbrella within general liability.
Development on prior years loss reserves within our U.S. and Bermuda professional liability and general liability product lines in 2022 was impacted
by broader market conditions. The impact of economic and social inflation, including the rising cost to adjust and settle claims and the impact of
more pervasive litigation financing trends, has contributed to the loss cost trends, leading to higher than anticipated losses in older accident years for
these products lines. The impacts of social inflation were most significant on our large, risk-managed excess professional liability accounts,
corresponding with a notable rise in the number of class action lawsuits on these years and the recent unfavorable legal environment. The
development of this claims trend was influenced by state and federal court closures following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which
delayed court proceedings for claims on the impacted product lines.
In 2023, we continued to see an increased frequency of large claims and unfavorable loss cost trends on certain of our U.S. and Bermuda general
liability and professional liability product lines. In response to consecutive quarters of adverse loss development, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we
conducted an extensive reserve study on selected general liability and professional liability product lines, which resulted in further increases to our
prior accident year loss reserves. Adverse development in 2023 on our U.S. and Bermuda general liability and professional liability product lines
within our Insurance segment totaled $330.7 million. This adverse development was most substantial on our primary casualty contractors' liability
and excess and umbrella general liability product lines.
A significant portion of our casualty portfolio is associated with construction business, which has grown meaningfully in recent years. Our study
determined that the ultimate claim reporting tail on certain of our casualty construction lines is likely to be longer than we initially anticipated. Within
our excess and umbrella general liability and risk-managed errors and omissions professional liability books, we determined that there was a greater
than expected propensity for limits below our attachment point to erode, pushing more claims into our layers. Further, reporting of these claims has
lagged historical loss development patterns due to the effect of court closures and claims backlogs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition
to aggressive tactics by the plaintiffs' bar and delayed claims reporting trends. Although we have achieved significant rate increases since 2019 on
many of these lines in response to heightened loss trends, the findings of our study led us to increase our loss development factors, and therefore our
estimate of the ultimate loss ratios, on our primary casualty contractors' liability, excess and umbrella general liability and risk-managed errors and
omissions professional liability product lines. This resulted in significant strengthening of reserves on the impacted lines, including on the 2020 to
2022 accident years, where we determined that the incurred loss trends are following a similar loss development trend at the same stage as older
accident years.
Additionally, we experienced $149.2 million of adverse development on our general liability and public entity product lines within our Reinsurance
segment. Adverse development on our general liability product lines was primarily attributable to large reported claims and adverse loss
development trends across multiple accident years. Substantially all of the adverse development on our public entity product line was attributable to
a segment of this business that we discontinued writing in 2020, which experienced an increased frequency of large claims over the past several
quarters, most significantly on the 2014 to 2019 accident years. Adverse development on both our general liability and public entity product lines
included notable strengthening as a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter in response to changes in loss trends observed in the reserve study
and the expectation that those loss trends will ultimately emerge within comparable reinsurance product lines.
The loss trends observed over the past two years have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on
these longer-tail product lines. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication
of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations, whereas in instances where claims trends are more favorable than
we previously anticipated, we are often
10K - 63

waiting to reduce loss reserves and will evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. For those lines in which we strengthened reserves,
although we believe the gross and net reserves are adequate based on information available at this time, we continue to closely monitor reported
claims, claim settlements, ceded reinsurance contract attachments and judicial decisions, among other things, and may adjust our estimates as new
information becomes available.
Changes in prior years loss reserves, including the trends and factors that impacted loss reserve development in 2023 and 2022, as well as further
details regarding the historical development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and changes in assumptions used to calculate
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are discussed in further detail in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
included under Item 8.
Actuarial Ranges
The following table summarizes our reserves for net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarially established high and low ends of
a range of reasonable reserve estimates at December 31, 2023. This table excludes the fully collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re.
As described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
attributable to acquisitions are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, which generally consists of the present value of the expected net loss
and loss adjustment expense payments plus a risk premium. The net loss reserves presented in this table represent our estimated future payments
for losses and loss adjustment expenses, whereas the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included on the consolidated balance
sheet include the unamortized portion of fair value adjustments recorded in conjunction with an acquisition.
Low End of High End of
Net Loss Actuarial Actuarial
(dollars in millions) Reserves Held Range(1) Range(1)
Insurance $ 11,048.5 $ 8,940.1 $ 11,929.5
Reinsurance $ 3,339.5 $ 2,732.9 $ 3,795.0
Other underwriting $ 89.8 $ 62.1 $ 109.6
(1) Due to the actuarial methods used to determine the separate ranges for each component of our business, it is not appropriate to aggregate the high or low ends of the
separate ranges to determine the high and low ends of the actuarial range on a consolidated basis.
Undue reliance should not be placed on these ranges of estimates as they are only one of many points of reference used by management to
determine its best estimate of ultimate losses. Further, actuarial ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential variability between loss reserves
estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate cost of settling claims. Similar to the development of our estimate of ultimate losses, actuarial
ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date, while ultimate paid losses are subject to events and circumstances that are
unknown as of the valuation date.
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we experienced favorable development on prior years loss reserves of 0.3% and 1.5%,
respectively, of beginning of year net loss reserves. The magnitude of our historical trend of favorable loss reserve development, which ranged from
4.6% to 6.4% of beginning of year net loss reserves over the preceding five years, was disrupted in 2022 and 2023 as a result of the emergence of
multiple factors that impacted the claims and loss trends on certain of our general liability and professional liability product lines, which resulted in
net adverse loss development within the select product lines previously discussed. The impacts of economic and social inflation, among other factors
previously discussed, have also created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on our longer-tail product
lines. As a result, in instances where claims trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated we are approaching reductions to prior year
loss reserves years cautiously. It is difficult for management to predict the duration and magnitude of a trend and, on a relative basis, it is even more
difficult to predict the emergence of factors or trends that are unknown today but may have a material impact on loss reserve development. In
assessing the likelihood of whether the trends previously discussed will continue and whether other trends may develop, we believe that a
reasonably likely movement in prior years loss reserves during 2024 would range from adverse development of 1%, or $150 million, to favorable
development of 5%, or $700 million, of December 31, 2023 net loss reserves.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included goodwill and intangible assets of $4.2 billion as follows:
December 31, 2023
(dollars in millions) Underwriting Markel Ventures Other (1) Total
Goodwill $ 895.6 $ 1,137.7 $ 591.5 $ 2,624.8
Intangible assets 325.3 736.7 526.6 1,588.6
Total $ 1,220.9 $ 1,874.4 $ 1,118.1 $ 4,213.4
(1) Amounts included in Other reflect our operations that are not included in a reportable segment, including our program services and our insurance-linked securities
operations.
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire a
business over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Indefinite-lived and other intangible assets are
recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of certain assets acquired, including goodwill and intangible
assets, and liabilities assumed involves significant judgment and the use of valuation models and other estimates, which require assumptions that
are inherently subjective. We did not make any significant acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.
Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing impairment tests, including the optional
assessment of qualitative factors for the annual impairment test, which is used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This assessment serves as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative
impairment test. We completed our annual tests for impairment as of October 1, 2023 based upon results of operations through September 30, 2023.
We elected to perform a quantitative assessment for one of our reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all of our other reporting units.
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for one of our Markel Ventures reporting units, in which we estimated the fair value of the
reporting unit using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flow projections included management's best estimate of
future growth and margins. The discount rate was primarily based on a capital asset pricing model. Based on the results of our quantitative
assessment, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carry value.
When performing our qualitative assessments, we considered macroeconomic factors such as industry conditions and market conditions. We also
considered reporting unit-specific events, actual financial performance versus expectations and management's future business expectations, as well
as the amount by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at the date of the last quantitative assessment. As part of our
qualitative assessment of recently acquired reporting units with material goodwill, we considered the fact that the businesses had been acquired in
orderly transactions between market participants, and our purchase price represented fair value at acquisition. We considered similar factors to
determine if there were any indicators requiring an assessment of the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets and concluded there were
not. For recent acquisitions for which we elected to perform a qualitative assessment, there were no events since acquisition that had a significant
adverse impact on the fair value of these reporting units through the assessment date. Based on the results of our qualitative assessments, we
believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of the assessed reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount.
Based on the results of our assessments, there were no impairments of goodwill in 2023, and none of our reporting units are at risk of a material
impairment of goodwill. Additionally, there were no significant events or changes in circumstances impacting our reporting units between the
assessment date and December 31, 2023. However, deterioration of market conditions related to the general economy or the specific industries in
which we operate, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance within a reporting unit beyond that which we considered or
included in our assessments, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, could impact the impairment
analysis and may result in future goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges.

See the risk factor titled "Impairment in the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results and financial condition" within Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion of risks associated with our goodwill and intangible assets.
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Nephila reporting unit in 2022. Based on the results of the assessment, we reduced the
carrying value of the goodwill of our Nephila reporting unit by $80.0 million to $221.8 million. We also evaluated our intangible assets within our
Nephila reporting unit for impairment and determined they were not impaired. See note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for
further details.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this report or are included in
the items listed below:
• the effect of cyclical trends or changes in market conditions on our underwriting, investing, Markel Ventures and other operations, including
demand and pricing in the insurance, reinsurance and other markets in which we operate;
• actions by competitors, including the use of technology and innovation to simplify the customer experience, increase efficiencies, redesign
products, alter models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry, and the effect of competition on market trends
and pricing;
• our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be successful and may
increase or create new risks (e.g., insufficient demand, change to risk exposures, distribution channel conflicts, execution risk, regulatory risk,
increased expenditures);
• the frequency and severity of man-made, health-related and natural catastrophes may exceed expectations, are unpredictable and, in the case
of some natural catastrophes, may be exacerbated by changing conditions in the climate, oceans and atmosphere, resulting in increased
frequency and/or severity of extreme weather-related events;
• we offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of our programs, and in other instances we are
legally required to offer terrorism insurance; in both circumstances, we actively manage our exposure, but if there is a covered terrorist attack,
we could sustain material losses;
• emerging claim and coverage issues, changing industry practices and evolving legal, judicial, social and other claims and coverage trends or
conditions, can increase the scope of coverage, the frequency and severity of claims and the period over which claims may be reported; these
factors, as well as uncertainties in the loss estimation process, can adversely impact the adequacy of our loss reserves and our allowance for
reinsurance recoverables;
• reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves, primarily because of reliance upon the original underwriting
decisions made by ceding companies and the longer lapse of time from the occurrence of loss events to their reporting to the reinsurer for
ultimate resolution;
• inaccuracies (whether due to data error, human error or otherwise) in the various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios,
predictive and stochastic modeling, and forecasting) we use to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our
insurance and insurance-linked securities businesses could cause us to misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks to which
we are exposed;
• changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book (which is in runoff), for
example, changes in assumptions and estimates of mortality, longevity, morbidity and interest rates, could result in material changes in our
estimated loss reserves for that business;

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in
equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our consolidated balance sheets include assets and liabilities
with estimated fair values that are subject to market risk. Our primary market risks are equity price risk associated with investments in equity
securities, interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our
international operations.
Our fixed maturity securities and equity securities are recorded at fair value. See note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included
under Item 8 for details regarding the fair value measurement of our fixed maturity and equity securities.
Equity Price Risk
We make investments in equity securities, which have historically produced higher long-term returns relative to fixed maturity securities, with capital
that is allocated for such purposes. We seek to invest in profitable companies, with honest and talented management, that exhibit reinvestment
opportunities and capital discipline, at reasonable prices. We intend to hold these investments over the long term and focus on long-term return on
equity securities, understanding that gains or losses on investments may fluctuate from one period to the next. Changes in the fair value of equity
securities are recognized in net income.
At December 31, 2023, our equity portfolio was concentrated in terms of the number of issuers and industries. Such concentrations can lead to
higher levels of volatility. At December 31, 2023, our ten largest equity holdings represented $3.9 billion, or 41%, of the equity portfolio. Investments
in the property and casualty insurance industry represented $1.7 billion, or 18%, of our equity portfolio at December 31, 2023 and included a $1.2
billion investment in the common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a company whose subsidiaries engage in a number of diverse business activities
in addition to insurance. We have investment guidelines that set limits on the equity holdings of our insurance subsidiaries.
The following table summarizes our equity price risk and shows the effect of a hypothetical 35% increase or decrease in market prices as of
December 31, 2023 and 2022. The selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios.

As of December 31, 2022
Equity securities $ 7,672 35% increase $ 10,357 16.2 %
35% decrease 4,987 (16.2)
Interest Rate Risk
Our fixed maturity investments and senior long-term debt and other debt are subject to interest rate risk. Increases and decreases in interest rates
typically result in decreases and increases, respectively, in the fair value of these financial instruments. Our fixed maturity investments are recorded
at estimated fair value in our financial statements, and therefore, changes in interest rates impact our financial position and results of operations.
Senior long-term debt and other debt is recorded at amortized cost in our financial statements, and therefore, changes in fair value do not impact our
financial position or results of operations.
10K - 69

Our underwriting operations provide our investment operations with steady inflows of premiums. These funds are invested predominantly in high-
quality government and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities that generally match the duration and currency of our loss reserves. As of
December 31, 2023, our fixed maturity portfolio had an average duration of 4.1 years and 97% of the portfolio was rated "AA" or better. See note 4(c)
of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for details regarding contractual maturity dates of our fixed maturity
portfolio. The changes in the estimated fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of taxes. We typically hold these fixed maturity investments until maturity, and as a result, unrealized holding
gains and losses on these securities are generally expected to reverse as the securities mature.
We work to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our fixed maturity portfolio. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is
managed with consideration given to the estimated duration of our loss reserves. We have investment guidelines that limit the maximum duration
and maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio.
We use a commercially available model to estimate the effect of interest rate risk on the fair values of our fixed maturity portfolio and debt. The
model estimates the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors including duration, prepayment, put options and call options. Fair
values are estimated based on the present value of cash flows, using a representative set of possible future interest rate scenarios. The model
requires that numerous assumptions be made about the future. To the extent that any of the assumptions are invalid, incorrect estimates could
result. The usefulness of a single point-in-time model is limited, as it is unable to accurately incorporate the full complexity of market interactions.
The following table summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and
2022. The selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our international operations' assets and liabilities. We manage this risk
primarily by matching assets and liabilities that are subject to foreign exchange rate risk as closely as possible. To assist with this matching, we
periodically purchase foreign currency forward contracts and purchase or sell foreign currencies in the open market. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses on our forward contracts are recorded in earnings. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of three months.
At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, 90% of our invested assets were denominated in United States (U.S.) Dollars. At both December 31, 2023 and
2022, 89% of our combined reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and life and annuity benefits were denominated in U.S. Dollars.
At those dates, the largest foreign currency denominated balances within both our invested assets and reserves for unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses and life and annuity benefits were the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk were
substantially matched or hedged.
Credit Risk
Credit risk, which is not considered a market risk, is the risk that an entity becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligation to us. Our primary
credit risks are the credit risk within our fixed maturity portfolio and the credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables within our underwriting,
program services and other fronting operations.
Fixed Maturity Investments
Credit risk exists within our fixed maturity portfolio from the potential for loss resulting from adverse changes in an issuer's ability to repay its debt
obligations. We monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that credit risk does not exceed prudent levels. We have consistently invested in high
credit quality, investment grade securities. As of December 31, 2023, 97% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated "AA" or better. Our policy is to
invest in investment grade securities and to minimize investments in fixed maturity securities that are unrated or rated below investment grade. Our
fixed maturity portfolio includes securities issued with financial guaranty insurance. We purchase fixed maturity securities based on our assessment
of the credit quality of the underlying assets without regard to insurance.
Our fixed maturity portfolio includes securities issued by foreign governments and non-sovereign foreign institutions. General concern exists about
foreign countries that experience financial difficulties during periods of adverse economic conditions. We monitor developments in foreign countries,
currencies and issuers that could pose risks to our fixed maturity portfolio, including ratings downgrades, political and financial changes and the
widening of credit spreads. Our fixed maturity portfolio is highly diversified and comprised of high quality securities.
We obtain information from news services, data providers, rating agencies and various financial market participants to assess potential negative
impacts on a country or company's financial risk profile. We analyze concentrations within our fixed maturity portfolio by country, currency and
issuer, which allows us to assess our level of diversification with respect to these exposures, reduce troubled exposures should they occur and
mitigate any future financial distress that these exposures could cause.
Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes securities issued by municipalities. General concern exists about municipalities that experience financial
difficulties during periods of adverse economic conditions. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our municipal bond portfolio by investing in high
quality securities and by diversifying our holdings, which are typically either general obligation or revenue bonds related to essential products and
services.

Reinsurance Recoverables
We have credit risk within our reinsurance recoverables to the extent any of our reinsurers are unwilling or unable to meet their obligations to us
under our ceded reinsurance agreements. We monitor changes in the financial condition of each of our reinsurers, and we assess our concentration
of credit risk on a regular basis. While we believe our net reinsurance recoverable balances are collectible, deterioration in reinsurers' ability to pay,
or collection disputes, could adversely affect our operating cash flows, financial position and results of operations.
Underwriting
Within our underwriting operations, our reinsurance recoverables balance for the ten largest reinsurers was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2023,
representing 65% of the $4.0 billion total reinsurance recoverables, before considering allowances for credit losses. We were the beneficiary of letters
of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $919.2 million at December 31, 2023, collateralizing reinsurance recoverable
balances due from these ten reinsurers. Nine of our ten largest reinsurers within our underwriting operations were rated "A" or better by A.M. Best
Company (A.M. Best). For the remaining reinsurer, which is a related party, our reinsurance recoverable was fully collateralized as of December 31,
2023.
In 2023, we recognized $65.0 million of credit losses in connection with fraudulent letters of credit that were provided by an affiliate of Vesttoo Ltd.
as collateral for reinsurance purchased on two policies, which we believe represents our full exposure to credit losses on the related reinsurance
recoverables. We are actively pursuing remedies to make recoveries on the reinsurance recoverables impacted by the fraudulent letters of credit and
do not have any other ceded reinsurance contracts with Vesttoo Ltd. or its affiliates.
Within our underwriting operations, we attempt to minimize credit exposure to reinsurers through adherence to internal reinsurance guidelines. To
participate in our reinsurance program, prospective companies generally must: (i) maintain an A.M. Best or Standard & Poor's rating of "A" (excellent)
or better; (ii) maintain minimum capital and surplus of $750 million; and (iii) provide collateral for recoverables in excess of an individually
established amount. We also consider qualitative factors when evaluating reinsurers for eligibility to participate in our reinsurance program. In
addition, certain foreign reinsurers for our U.S. insurance operations must provide collateral equal to 100% of recoverables, with the exception of
reinsurers who have been granted certified or authorized status by an insurance company's state of domicile. Our credit exposure to Lloyd's of
London syndicates is managed through individual and aggregate exposure thresholds.
Program Services
Within our program services business, our reinsurance recoverables balance for the ten largest reinsurers was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2023,
representing 56% of the $4.9 billion total reinsurance recoverables, before considering allowances for credit losses. We were the beneficiary of letters
of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023, collateralizing reinsurance recoverable
balances due from these ten reinsurers, and $3.3 billion for our total reinsurance recoverables balance. Five of our ten largest reinsurers were rated
"A" or better by A.M. Best. For four of the remaining five reinsurers, as of December 31, 2023, collateral held exceeded the related reinsurance
recoverable.
Within our program services business, we mitigate credit risk by either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized reinsurers or requiring that
the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks, which, in some instances, exceeds the related reinsurance recoverable. For
reinsurers with a credit rating of lower than "A" we employ a stringent collateral monitoring program, under which the majority of the reinsurance
recoverable balances is fully collateralized. These collateral requirements are regularly monitored by a credit committee within our program services
operations.
Other Fronting
For our other fronting arrangements, which are written on behalf of our ILS operations, our total reinsurance recoverables balance was $448.3 million
at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our ILS operations held investor collateral in excess of the related reinsurance recoverables. For
this business, we require collateral up to a specified level of annual aggregate agreement year losses, which is held in a trust for which we are the
beneficiary. The required collateral is monitored regularly against the annual aggregate agreement year losses to ensure adequacy of the collateral
in the event of a loss.

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Markel Group Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Markel Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and
2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Estimation of the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the Company's underwriting
operations
As described in Note 11, the Company has recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (loss reserves) of $23.5 billion
as of December 31, 2023. Of this amount, $18.1 billion represents loss reserves for the Company's underwriting operations. The Company's
actuaries use established actuarial methods and past development patterns to estimate ultimate losses to be paid. For its underwriting
operations, loss reserves are established at the Company's best estimates, which incorporate the actuarial point estimates and are adjusted
for certain subjective factors.
10K - 73

We identified the assessment of loss reserve estimation for the Company's underwriting operations as a critical audit matter because it
involved significant measurement uncertainty, which required complex auditor judgment. The assessment of actuarial methods and key
assumptions used to estimate ultimate losses required specialized actuarial skills and subjective auditor judgment. Key assumptions included
weighting of actuarial methods, expected loss ratios, and patterns and variability of loss development.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. With the assistance of actuarial professionals, as
appropriate, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's loss reserving process
for its underwriting operations. This included controls over key assumptions and the determination of loss reserves. Additionally, we also
involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
• assessing the Company's actuarial methodologies by comparing to generally accepted actuarial methodologies and evaluating the
weighting of the methods based on common industry practice
• developing independent actuarial estimates for certain product lines using the Company's underlying historical claims and policy data
• for certain product lines, assessing the Company's assumptions about future claims reporting and payments for consistency with historical
loss development and payment patterns
• developing an independent range of consolidated loss reserves based on actuarial methods and assumptions, comparing those results to
the Company's recorded reserves and evaluating the movement of the Company's recorded reserve within our range

MARKEL GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Markel Group Inc., formerly Markel Corporation, is a holding company comprised of a diverse group of companies and investments with specialty
insurance at its core. Effective May 26, 2023, Markel Corporation changed its name to Markel Group Inc. (Markel Group). Through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Markel Ventures, Inc. (Markel Ventures), Markel Group owns controlling interests in businesses that operate in a variety of industries. See
note 2 for details regarding reportable segments.
a) Basis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.)
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of Markel Group and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as any variable
interest entities (VIEs) that meet the requirements for consolidation (the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates the results of its Markel Ventures subsidiaries on a one-month lag, with the exception of
significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation.
b) Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management periodically reviews its estimates and assumptions. Quarterly reviews include evaluating the adequacy of reserves for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions for goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed in conjunction with an
acquisition, and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reassessed at least annually for impairment. Actual results may differ materially
from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
c) Investments. Available-for-sale investments and equity securities are recorded at estimated fair value. Available-for-sale investments include
fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. Fixed maturity securities include government and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed
securities with original maturities of more than one year. Short-term investments are primarily comprised of treasury bills with original maturities of
one year or less.
Realized investment gains or losses on available-for-sale investments are included in net income. Realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-
sale investments are derived using the first-in, first-out method on the trade date. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net
of income taxes, are included in other comprehensive income. The Company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess declines in the fair
value of its available-for-sale investments. Any credit-related impairment losses on the Company's available-for-sale investments are recorded as an
allowance, subject to reversal, and recognized in net income. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are included in net
income as net investment gains or losses.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturity securities as an adjustment to the yield using the
effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from both the
estimated fair value and the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities and included within other assets on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets. Any uncollectible accrued interest receivable is written off in the period it is deemed uncollectible.
See note 4 and note 5 for further details regarding the Company's investment portfolio.
d) Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents, with the
exception of treasury bills, which are classified as short-term investments. The carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value.
e) Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use are recorded as restricted cash
and cash equivalents. The carrying value of the Company's restricted cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
10K - 79

f) Receivables. Receivables include amounts receivable from agents, brokers and insureds, which represent premiums that are both currently due
and amounts not yet due on insurance and reinsurance policies. Premiums for insurance policies are generally due at inception. Premiums for
reinsurance policies generally become due over the period of coverage based on the policy terms. Changes in the estimate of reinsurance premiums
written will result in an adjustment to premiums receivable in the period they are determined. Receivables also include amounts receivable from
contracts with customers, which represent the Company's unconditional right to consideration for satisfying the performance obligations outlined in
the contract.
The Company monitors credit risk associated with receivables, taking into consideration the fact that in certain instances in the Company's insurance
operations credit risk may be reduced by the Company's right to offset loss obligations or unearned premiums against premiums receivable. An
allowance is established for credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the receivable, which is recorded net of this allowance. The
allowance is charged to net income in the period the receivable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company's
estimate of expected credit losses. See note 7 for further details regarding receivables.
g) Reinsurance Recoverables. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with
the reinsured business. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk to minimize its
exposure to significant losses from individual reinsurers. To further reduce credit exposure on reinsurance recoverables, the Company has received
collateral, including letters of credit and trust accounts, from certain reinsurers. Cash collateral related to these reinsurance agreements is available,
without restriction, when the Company pays losses covered by the reinsurance agreements. An allowance is established for credit losses expected to
be incurred over the life of the reinsurance recoverable, which is recorded net of this allowance. The allowance is charged to net income in the period
the recoverable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company's estimate of expected credit losses. As of
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for credit losses associated with the Company's reinsurance recoverables was not material to the
consolidated financial statements.
h) Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. Costs directly related to the acquisition of insurance premiums are deferred and amortized over the related
policy period, generally one year. The Company only defers acquisition costs incurred that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new or
renewal insurance contracts, including commissions to agents and brokers, salaries and benefits and premium taxes. Commissions received related
to reinsurance premiums ceded are netted against broker commissions in determining acquisition costs eligible for deferral. To the extent that future
policy revenues on existing policies are not adequate to cover related costs and expenses, deferred policy acquisition costs are charged to earnings.
The Company does not consider anticipated investment income in determining whether a premium deficiency exists. See note 2(a) and (g) for further
details regarding policy acquisition costs.
i) Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess
of the amount paid to acquire a business over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Indefinite-lived
and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of certain assets acquired and
liabilities assumed involves significant judgment and the use of valuation models and other estimates, which require assumptions that are inherently
subjective. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. The Company completes an annual test during
the fourth quarter of each year based upon the results of operations through September 30. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally five to 20 years, and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See note 8 for further details regarding goodwill and intangible assets.
j) Equity Method Investments. The Company holds certain investments that are required to be accounted for under the equity method, whereby
they initially are recorded at cost within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently increased or decreased by the Company's
proportionate share of the net income or loss of the investee and other transactions impacting the investee's equity. The Company records its
proportionate share of net income or loss of the investee in services and other revenues. The Company records its proportionate share of other
comprehensive income or loss of the investee as a component of other comprehensive income. Dividends or other equity distributions in excess of
the Company's cumulative equity in earnings of the investee are recorded as a reduction of the investment. The Company reviews equity method
investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other-
than-temporary. See note 6 for further details regarding the Company's equity method investments.
k) Property and Equipment. Property and equipment is maintained primarily by certain of the Company's Markel Ventures businesses and is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the
10K - 80

straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, was $1.3
billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets.
l) Leases. The present value of future lease payments for the Company's leases with terms greater than 12 months is included on the consolidated
balance sheets as lease liabilities and right-of-use lease assets within other liabilities and other assets, respectively.
The Company's lease portfolio primarily consists of operating leases for real estate and equipment. Total expected lease payments are based on the
lease payments specified in the contract and the stated term, including any options to extend or terminate that the Company is reasonably certain to
exercise. The Company accounts for lease components and any associated non-lease components within a contract as a single lease component, and
therefore allocates all of the expected lease payments to the lease component.
The lease liability, which represents the Company's contractual obligation to make lease payments, is calculated based on the present value of
expected lease payments over the remaining lease term, discounted using the Company's collateralized incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date. The lease liability is then adjusted for any prepaid rent, lease incentives received or capitalized initial direct costs to determine
the lease asset, which represents the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
Total lease costs are primarily comprised of rental expense for operating leases, which is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Rental expense attributable to the Company's underwriting operations is included in underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses and rental
expense attributable to the Company's other operations is included in products expenses and services and other expenses in the consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income. See note 9 for further details regarding leases.
m) Inventories. Inventories are maintained at certain of the Company's Markel Ventures businesses and consist primarily of raw materials, work-in-
process and finished goods. Inventories are generally valued based on the nature of the inventory, including the first-in-first-out, standard cost and
specific identification methods, and stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories were $617.2 million and $639.6 million as of
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
n) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. The Company owns controlling interests in various companies through its Markel Ventures operations.
In some cases, the Company has the option to acquire the remaining equity interests, and the remaining equity interests have the option to sell their
interests to the Company, in the future. The redemption value of the remaining equity interests is generally based on the respective company's
earnings in specified periods preceding the redemption date. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are redeemable in 2024 or become
redeemable between 2025 and 2030.
The Company recognizes changes in the redemption value that exceed the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests to retained
earnings as if the balance sheet date was also the redemption date. Changes in the redemption value also result in an adjustment to net income to
common shareholders in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share. See note 19 for further details regarding the calculation
of basic and diluted net income per common share.
o) Income Taxes. The Company records deferred income taxes to reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when management believes it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax positions
that meet the more likely than not threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach, whereby the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See note 15 for further details regarding income taxes.
p) Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on the Company's property and casualty
insurance business are based on evaluations of reported claims and estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported.
Estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported are based on
10K - 81

reserve development studies, among other things. Recorded reserves are estimates, and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the
estimates. See note 11 for further details regarding unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.
q) Life and Annuity Benefits. The Company has a run-off block of life and annuity reinsurance contracts that subject the Company to mortality,
longevity and morbidity risks. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2018-12, Financial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and
restated all prior periods presented to reflect the new accounting standard. The primary component of the Company's liabilities for life and annuity
benefits is the present value of the liability for future policyholder benefits. The cash flow assumptions used to determine the policyholder benefit
reserves are reviewed, and updated as necessary, at least annually. Interest accretion for the reserves is calculated using the discount rate locked-in
at contract inception. Policy benefit reserves are remeasured each period using current discount rates, based on yields for upper-medium grade fixed
maturity securities, with the impact of changes in the discount rate included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. All other results
attributable to the run-off of life and annuity reinsurance contracts are included in services and other revenues and services and other expenses in
the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Investment income earned on the investments that support the policy benefit
reserves are included in net investment income. Because of the uncertainty in the assumptions used to estimate reserves for life and annuity benefit
obligations and the long-term nature of these reinsurance contracts, the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimated liability. See note
13 for further details regarding life and annuity benefits.
r) Revenue Recognition.
Property and Casualty Premiums
Insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the inception of a policy and earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period, typically one
year. The cost of reinsurance ceded is initially recorded as prepaid reinsurance premiums and is amortized over the reinsurance contract period in
proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. Premiums ceded are netted against premiums written. For multi-year contracts where
insurance premiums are payable in annual installments, written premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on management's best
estimate of total premiums to be received. For contracts where the cedent has the ability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term
of the policy, written premiums are generally recorded on an annual basis or up to the contract cancellation point. The remaining premiums are
estimated and included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.
Assumed reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms and information received from cedents
and brokers and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period, or for multi-year contracts, in proportion with the underlying risk exposure
to the extent there is variability in the exposure through the coverage period. Changes in reinsurance premium estimates are expected and may
result in significant adjustments in any period. These estimates change over time as additional information regarding changes in underlying
exposures is obtained. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded as premiums written in the period they are determined
and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period, or immediately if the coverage period has ended. The Company uses the periodic
method to account for assumed reinsurance from foreign reinsurers as a result of the sufficiency of the information provided by the reinsurer, which
is consistent with its accounting for assumed reinsurance from U.S. reinsurers.
Certain contracts that the Company writes provide for reinstatement of coverage. Reinstatement premiums are the premiums for the restoration of
the insurance or reinsurance limit of a contract to its full amount after a loss occurrence by the insured or reinsured. The Company accrues for
reinstatement premiums resulting from losses recorded. Such accruals are based upon contractual terms and management judgment is involved with
respect to the amount of losses recorded. Changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with reinstatement premium features will result in
changes in reinstatement premiums based on contractual terms. Reinstatement premiums are recognized as premiums written at the time losses are
recorded and are generally earned on a pro rata basis over the remaining coverage period.
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily relate to the Company's Markel Ventures, program services and other fronting and insurance-linked securities (ILS)
operations and consist of revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenues are recognized when, or as, control of the promised goods or
services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange
for those goods or services. Contracts with customers generally have an original term of one year or less. For contracts with customers that have an
original term greater than one year, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount for which it has a right to invoice for the products delivered or
services
10K - 82

performed. Certain customers may receive volume rebates or credits for products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
The Company estimates these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to the customer and reduces revenues recognized by a
corresponding amount. The Company does not expect significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration over the term of the contracts.
Payment terms for products and services vary by the type of product or service offered and the location of the customer, and payment is typically
received at or shortly after the point of sale. For certain products, the Company requires partial payment in the form of a deposit before the products
are delivered to the customer, which is included in other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Through its Markel Ventures operations, the Company has several different businesses that manufacture or produce a variety of products, including
ornamental plants, precast concrete, equipment used in baking systems, over-the-road transportation equipment, portable dredges, residential
homes and flooring for the trucking industry. Most of the Company's product revenues are recognized when the products are shipped to the customer
or the products arrive at the agreed upon destination with the end customer. Certain of the Company's products revenues are recognized based on
percentage of completion. Some of the Company's contracts include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, revenues are
allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price, which is derived from amounts stated in the contract.
Through its Markel Ventures operations, the Company also has several different businesses that provide various types of services, including
distribution of exterior building products, fire protection and life safety services and consulting services. Service revenues are generally recognized
either at a point-in-time when services are provided or over the term of the contracts based on hours incurred or as services are provided.
The Company's Markel Ventures operations also include certain businesses that earn revenues through the leasing of equipment. The revenues from
these leases are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Company's other revenues also include fronting fees, or ceding fees, received in exchange for providing access to the U.S. property and casualty
insurance market, which are based on the gross premiums written on behalf of general agent and capacity provider clients. Ceding fees are earned in
a manner consistent with the recognition of the gross premiums earned on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the
terms of the underlying policies reinsured.
The Company's other revenues also include investment management fee income. Investment management fee income is recognized over the period
in which investment management services are provided and is calculated and recognized monthly, based on the net asset value of the accounts
managed for most of the funds and underlying gross premium volume for the remaining funds. For certain accounts, the Company is also entitled to
participate, on a fixed-percentage basis, in any net income generated in excess of an agreed-upon threshold as established by the underlying
investment management agreements. In general, net income is calculated at the end of each calendar year and incentive fees are payable annually.
Incentive fee income is recognized at the conclusion of the contractual performance period, when the uncertainty related to performance has been
resolved.
See note 10 for further details regarding products, services and other revenues.
s) Program Services. In connection with its program services business, the Company enters into contractual agreements with both producing
general agents and reinsurers, whereby the general agents and reinsurers are typically obligated to each other for payment of insurance amounts,
including premiums, commissions and losses. To the extent these funds are not the obligation of the Company and are settled directly between the
general agent and the reinsurer, no receivables or payables are recorded for these amounts. All obligations of the Company's insurance subsidiaries
owed to or on behalf of their policyholders are recorded by the Company and, to the extent appropriate, offsetting reinsurance recoverables are
recorded.
t) Foreign Currency Transactions. The U.S. Dollar is the Company's reporting currency and the primary functional currency of its foreign
underwriting operations. The functional currencies of the Company's other foreign operations are the currencies of the primary economic
environments in which the majority of their business is transacted.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are the result of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency at each foreign entity. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at current exchange rates, with
resulting gains and losses included in net foreign exchange gains within net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the
functional currency at historic exchange rates. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with resulting gains and losses, including the
portion attributable to movements in
10K - 83

exchange rates, included in the change in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments, net of taxes within other comprehensive income.
While the Company attempts to naturally hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching assets and liabilities in the same
currencies, there is a financial statement mismatch between the gains or losses recorded in net income related to insurance reserves denominated in
non-functional currencies and the gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income related to the available-for-sale securities held in non-
functional currencies supporting the reserves.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into the U.S. Dollar at
current exchange rates, with resulting gains or losses included, net of taxes, in the change in foreign currency translation adjustments within other
comprehensive income.
u) Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income represents all changes in equity that result from recognized transactions and other economic
events during the period. Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are included in
comprehensive income but excluded from net income, such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments, changes in discount rate
for life and annuity benefits, foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in net actuarial pension loss. See note 20 for further details
regarding other comprehensive income.
v) Net Income Per Common Share. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing adjusted net income to shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing adjusted
net income to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year.
See note 19 for further details regarding the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share.
w) Variable Interest Entities. The Company determines whether it has relationships with entities defined as VIEs in accordance with FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, Consolidation. Under this guidance, a VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is
determined to be the primary beneficiary.
An entity in which the Company holds a variable interest is a VIE if any of the following conditions exist: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not
sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) as a group, the holders of equity
investment at risk lack either the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity's activities that
most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or the obligation to absorb the expected losses or right to receive the expected residual
returns, or (c) the voting rights of some investors are disproportionate to their obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to
receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or both and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of
an investor with disproportionately few voting rights.
The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest as a result of having
both (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb
losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The Company determines whether an entity is a VIE at the inception of its variable interest in the entity and upon the occurrence of certain
reconsideration events. The Company continually reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which it holds a variable interest. See
note 17 for further details regarding the Company's involvement with VIEs.
x) Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023
Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-12 and several ASUs issued as amendments to ASU No. 2018-12. This standard
requires insurance companies with long duration contracts to: (1) review and, if there is a change, update the assumptions used to measure expected
cash flows at least annually; (2) update the discount rate assumption at each reporting date; and (3) enhance certain qualitative and quantitative
disclosures. ASU No. 2018-12 was applied using a modified retrospective approach that required restatement of prior periods presented, including a
cumulative adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) as a result of updating the
discount rate assumption. At the transition date, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 had no impact on retained earnings but resulted in a decrease to
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $15.3 million, which was comprised of the following corresponding adjustments to life and
annuity benefits and deferred tax liabilities.
10K - 84

(dollars in thousands) January 1, 2021
Reverse reserve deficiency adjustment related to unrealized gains on underlying investment portfolio of available-for-sale
securities $ 119,548
Apply updated discount rate to the liability for future policyholder benefits (138,865)
Increase in life and annuity benefits (19,317)
Decrease in deferred tax liability 4,058
Decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes $ (15,259)
The impact of changes in the discount rate on the liability for future policyholder benefits following the transition date are included in other
comprehensive income (loss) in the respective periods and, combined with the transition adjustment, resulted in the following cumulative changes to
the Company's previously presented consolidated balance sheets.
December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2022 2021
Decrease (increase) in life and annuity benefits $ 113,396 $ (19,759)
Decrease (increase) in deferred tax liability (23,813) 4,149
Increase (decrease) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes $ 89,583 $ (15,610)
Changes in the discount rate on the liability for future policyholder benefits also resulted in an increase of $105.2 million and a decrease of $0.4
million to the other comprehensive loss previously presented in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was comprised of the following adjustments.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2022 2021
Reverse benefit included in change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale-investments, net
of taxes, related to reversal of previously recognized reserve deficiency adjustment $ (44,682) $ (49,761)
Change in discount rate for life and annuity benefits, net of taxes 149,874 49,411
Increase (decrease) in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes $ 105,192 $ (350)
The adoption of other provisions of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows
for any of the periods presented.
Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract
Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2021-08 requires contract assets and liabilities accounted for under FASB ASC 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, to be recorded at the acquisition date as if the acquirer entered into those contracts itself on the contract inception dates,
rather than at fair value. At adoption, ASU No. 2021-08 did not impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but
prospectively, this ASU will impact amounts recorded by the Company for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with certain
acquisitions.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The
standard requires public companies to, among other things: (1) disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are
regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (2) disclose, on an
annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment expenses that are not separately disclosed as significant segment expenses and a description
of its composition; (3) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim
periods; and (4) disclose the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and an explanation of how the chief operating decision maker
uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU No. 2023-07
becomes effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of 2024 and will be applied using a retrospective approach that requires recasting of all prior
periods presented. The standard will not impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
10K - 85

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The standard requires
public companies, on an annual basis, to provide enhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional
information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The standard also requires public companies to, among other things,
disaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU No. 2023-09 becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2025.
The standard will not impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
2. Segment Reporting Disclosures
The Company has four reportable segments: Insurance, Reinsurance, Investing and Markel Ventures.
The chief operating decision maker reviews the Company's ongoing underwriting operations on a global basis in the following two segments:
Insurance and Reinsurance. In determining how to allocate resources and assess the performance of the Company's underwriting results,
management considers many factors, including the nature of the insurance product sold, the type of account written and the type of customer
served. The Insurance segment includes all direct business and facultative reinsurance placements written on a risk-bearing basis within the
Company's underwriting operations. The Reinsurance segment includes all treaty reinsurance written on a risk-bearing basis within the Company's
underwriting operations. All investing activities related to the Company's insurance operations are included in the Investing segment.
The Company's other insurance operations primarily consist of the results of the Company's program services and other fronting business and
insurance-linked securities operations. Other insurance operations also include results for lines of business discontinued prior to, or in conjunction
with, acquisitions, including development on asbestos and environmental loss reserves and results attributable to the run-off of life and annuity
reinsurance business, which are monitored separately from the Company's ongoing underwriting operations. For purposes of segment reporting,
none of these other insurance operations are considered to be reportable segments.
The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews and assesses Markel Ventures' performance in the aggregate, as a single operating segment.
The Markel Ventures segment primarily consists of controlling interests in a diverse portfolio of businesses that operate in various industries.
Segment profit for each of the Company's underwriting segments is measured by underwriting profit. The property and casualty insurance industry
commonly defines underwriting profit as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance
expenses. Underwriting profit does not replace operating income or net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of profitability.
Underwriting profit or loss provides a basis for management to evaluate the Company's underwriting performance. Segment profit for the Company's
underwriting segments may also include other revenues and expenses that are attributable to the Company's underwriting operations that are not
captured in underwriting profit. Segment profit for the Investing segment is measured by income from the Company's investment portfolio, which is
comprised of net investment income and net investment gains. Segment profit for the Investing segment also includes income from equity method
investments, which is included within services and other revenues. Segment profit for the Markel Ventures segment is measured by operating
income.
For management reporting purposes, the Company allocates assets to its underwriting operations and to its Investing and Markel Ventures segments
and certain of its other operations, including its program services and other fronting and insurance-linked securities operations. Underwriting assets
include assets attributed to the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments, discontinued underwriting lines of business, as well as assets that
are not specifically allocated to the Company's other operations. Generally, the Company manages its underwriting assets in the aggregate and
therefore does not allocate assets to individual underwriting segments.

The Company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether the decline in the fair value of any investment below its cost basis is the
result of a credit loss. All available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses are reviewed. The Company considers many factors in completing its
quarterly review of securities with unrealized losses for credit-related impairment to determine whether a credit loss exists, including the extent to
which fair value is below cost, the implied yield to maturity, rating downgrades of the security and whether or not the issuer has failed to make
scheduled principal or interest payments. The Company also takes into consideration information about the financial condition of the issuer and
industry factors that could negatively impact the issuer.
If the decline in fair value of an available-for-sale security below its amortized cost is considered to be the result of a credit loss, the Company
compares the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. The extent to which the
estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security represents the credit loss, which is
recorded as an allowance and recognized in net income. The allowance is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of
the security. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the non-credit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive
income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses for any available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.
Quarterly, the Company also considers whether it intends to sell an available-for-sale security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to
sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these instances, a decline in fair value is recognized in net income based on the fair value of
the security at the time of assessment, resulting in a new cost basis for the security.
c) The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2023 are shown below by contractual maturity.

5. Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the assets or liabilities fall within different levels of the
hierarchy, the classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.
Classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy considers the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability and
transparency of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The levels
of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
• Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.
• Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability and market-corroborated inputs.
• Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable for the asset or liability and are significant to the fair value measurement.
In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various
methods, including the market, income and cost approaches. The Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets
and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
Available-for-sale investments and equity securities. Available-for-sale investments and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis. Available-for-sale investments include fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. Fair value is determined by the Company after
considering various sources of information, including information provided by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service provides prices for
substantially all of the Company's fixed maturity securities and equity securities. In determining fair value, the Company generally does not adjust
the prices obtained from the pricing service. The Company obtains an understanding of the pricing service's valuation methodologies and related
inputs, which include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids, offers, duration, credit ratings, estimated cash
flows and prepayment speeds. The Company validates prices provided by the pricing service by reviewing prices from other pricing sources and
analyzing pricing data in certain instances.
The Company has evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based
upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Level 1 investments include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York
Stock Exchange. Level 2 investments include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, foreign government
bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities. Level 3 investments include
the Company's investments in insurance-linked securities funds that are in run-off, which are not traded on an active exchange and are valued using
unobservable inputs.
Fair value for available-for-sale investments and equity securities is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets, if available. Due to
variations in trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices, fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 investments. The fair value of
fixed maturity securities is normally derived through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the
reporting date based upon available market observable data previously described. If there are no recent reported trades, the fair value of fixed
maturity securities may be derived through the use of matrix pricing or model processes, where future cash flow expectations are developed based
upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value of obligations of states,
municipalities and political subdivisions, corporate bonds and obligations of foreign governments include reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer
spreads, bids, offers, credit information and estimated cash flows. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value of commercial mortgage-backed
securities and residential mortgage-backed securities include the type of underlying assets, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral
information, tranche type and volatility, estimated cash flows, credit information, default rates, recovery rates, issuer spreads and the year of issue.
10K - 98

Senior long-term debt and other debt. Senior long-term debt and other debt is carried at amortized cost with the estimated fair value disclosed on the
consolidated balance sheets. Senior long-term debt and other debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy due to variations in trading
volumes and the lack of quoted market prices. Fair value is generally derived through recent reported trades, making adjustments through the
reporting date, if necessary, based upon available market observable data including U.S. Treasury securities and implied credit spreads. Significant
inputs used to determine the fair value of senior long-term debt and other debt include reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids and
offers.
The following tables present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy.

Previously, Level 3 investments included the Company's investment in an insurance-linked securities fund managed by Markel CATCo Investment
Management Ltd. (MCIM). In 2022, the Company's remaining investment was redeemed ($41.3 million) in conjunction with a buy-out transaction that
provided for an accelerated return of all remaining capital to investors. See note 17 for further details about the Company's Markel CATCo operations
and the buy-out transaction.
Except as disclosed in note 3 and note 8, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
6. Equity Method Investments
The Company's equity method investments, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $605.9 million and $494.0
million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's proportionate share of earnings in its equity method investments was a loss
of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a loss of $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and income of $15.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021.
The Company's most significant equity method investment is an investment in Hagerty, Inc. (Hagerty), which is accounted for on a quarter lag.
Hagerty is an automotive enthusiast brand offering integrated membership products and programs as well as a specialty insurance provider focused
on the global automobile enthusiast market. The Company's ownership interest in Hagerty was 23% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The
Company's investment is comprised of Class A common shares, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as Class V
common shares, associated with the Company's original investment, that have special voting rights and can be converted on a one-for-one basis into
Class A common shares. The Company accounts for its investment under the equity method as it is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant
influence over Hagerty's operating and financial policies through a combination of its voting interest, its right to designate a board member and
business it conducts with Hagerty. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Hagerty was $237.4
million and $245.1 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the estimated value of the Company's investment, based on the closing stock price of Hagerty's Class A common
shares, was $608.4 million and $656.0 million, respectively. See note 18 for further details regarding related party transactions with Hagerty.

(2) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, goodwill was net of accumulated impairment losses of $190.6 million, of which $171.9 million was in Other and $18.7 million was in
Markel Ventures.
The Company completed its annual tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment as of October 1, 2023 based upon results of
operations through September 30, 2023. See note 1 for further details regarding impairment testing. There was no impairment of goodwill during
2023 or 2021 and no impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2023, 2022 or 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment
of goodwill was $80.0 million, which was attributable to our Nephila ILS operations.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Nephila in 2018, through 2022, investment performance in the broader ILS market was adversely impacted by
consecutive years of elevated catastrophe losses. These events, as well as volatility in the capital markets, impacted investor decisions around
allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn impacted capital raises and redemptions within the funds Nephila manages. As a result, the Company
performed a quantitative impairment assessment for the Nephila reporting unit in 2022. The Company estimated the fair value of the Nephila
reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The discount rates used to determine the fair value
estimates were developed based on a capital asset pricing model using market-based inputs, as well as an assessment of the inherent risk in
projected future cash flows. As a result of the assessment, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill attributable to Nephila totaling
$80.0 million, reducing the goodwill of the Nephila reporting unit to $221.8 million. The Company also evaluated the intangible assets within the
Nephila reporting unit for impairment and determined they were not impaired.

In 2023, the Company completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction to cede its portfolio of policies comprised of liabilities for its run-off book of
United Kingdom (U.K.) motor casualty business in exchange for payments totaling $125.1 million, which approximated the carrying value of the
Company's reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on the ceded policies.
In 2023, the Company recognized losses on its intellectual property collateral protection insurance product written within the Insurance segment's
professional liability product line. These losses included $65.0 million of credit losses recognized in connection with fraudulent letters of credit that
were provided by an affiliate of Vesttoo Ltd. as collateral for reinsurance purchased on two policies, which the Company believes represents its full
exposure to credit losses on the related reinsurance recoverables. The Company is actively pursuing remedies to make recoveries on the reinsurance
recoverables impacted by the fraudulent letters of credit and does not have any other ceded reinsurance contracts with Vesttoo Ltd. or its affiliates.
In 2023, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $40.1 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to
the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $9.3 million.
In 2022, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $46.2 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to
Hurricane Ian. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $115.3 million. The Company also had gross losses and loss
adjustment expenses of $850.0 million within its program services and other fronting operations attributed to Hurricane Ian, all of which were ceded
to third-party reinsurers managed through the Company's insurance-linked securities operations.

In 2022, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses also included $35.7 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $44.3 million.
In 2021, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $195.0 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses from Winter
Storm Uri, European Floods and Hurricane Ida. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $221.7 million.
b) Reserving Methodology
The Company uses a variety of techniques to establish the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the
ultimate amounts payable. The Company maintains reserves for specific claims incurred and reported (case reserves) and reserves for claims
incurred but not reported (IBNR reserves), which include expected development on reported claims. The Company does not discount its reserves for
losses and loss adjustment expenses to reflect estimated present value, except for reserves held for a run-off book of U.K. motor business.
Additionally, reserves assumed in connection with an acquisition are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value adjustment includes
an adjustment to reflect the acquired reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at present value plus a risk premium, the net of which is
amortized to losses and loss adjustment expenses within the consolidated statements of income.
As of any balance sheet date, all claims have not yet been reported, and some claims may not be reported for many years. As a result, the liability for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims.
There is normally a time lag between when a loss event occurs and when it is reported to the Company. The actuarial methods that the Company
uses to estimate losses have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow the
Company to more accurately estimate future payments. There is also often a time lag between cedents establishing case reserves or re-estimating
their reserves and notifying the Company of those new or revised case reserves. As a result, the reporting lag is more pronounced in reinsurance
contracts than in the insurance contracts. On reinsurance transactions, the reporting lag will generally be 60 to 90 days after the end of a reporting
period, but can be longer in some cases. There may also be a more pronounced reporting lag, as well as reliance on third-party claims handling
practices and reserve estimates, on insurance contracts for which the Company is not the primary insurer and participates only in excess layers of
loss. Based on the experience of the Company's actuaries and management, the Company selects loss development factors and trending techniques
to mitigate the difficulties caused by reporting lags. At least annually, the Company evaluates its loss development factors and trending assumptions
using its own loss data, as well as cedent-specific and industry data, and updates them as needed.
IBNR reserves are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors,
using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. IBNR reserves are calculated by
subtracting paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves from estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. IBNR
reserves were 72% of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2023 compared to 70% at December 31, 2022.
In establishing liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company's actuaries estimate an ultimate loss ratio, by accident year or
underwriting year, for each product line with input from underwriting and claims personnel. For product lines in which loss reserves are established
on an underwriting year basis, the Company has developed a methodology to convert from underwriting year to accident year for financial reporting
purposes. In estimating an ultimate loss ratio for a particular line of business, the actuaries may use one or more actuarial reserving methods and
select from these a single point estimate. To varying degrees, these methods include detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting, settlement
activity, claim frequency and severity, policyholder loss experience, industry loss experience and changes in market and economic conditions, policy
forms and exposures. Greater judgment may be required when new product lines are introduced or when there have been changes in claims handling
practices, as the statistical data available may be insufficient. Greater judgment also may be required for product lines that experience a low
frequency of high severity claims, particularly when the Company is reliant on third party case reserve estimates and claims handling practices.
These estimates also reflect implicit and explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of external factors, including economic and social
inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, general economic conditions and recent trends in these factors. Management believes the process of
evaluating past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future
events.
10K - 105

Estimates for losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as pandemics and wars, are based on claims
received to date, industry loss estimates and output from both industry, broker and proprietary models, as well as analysis of the Company's ceded
reinsurance contracts. The Company may also perform detailed policy and reinsurance contract level reviews. The level of reliance on these
procedures varies depending on the timing of the event relative to the point at which the Company develops its estimates. The Company also
considers loss experience on historical events that may have similar characteristics to the underlying event and current market conditions, including
the level of economic inflation. In the period shortly after an event occurs, more weight is put on modeling and industry estimates, whereas with the
passage of time, greater reliance is placed on incurred claims data and historical claim patterns. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such
losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. As additional claims are
reported and paid, and industry loss estimates are revised, the Company incorporates this new information into its analysis and adjusts its estimate
of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses as appropriate.
Loss reserves are established at management's best estimate, which is developed using the actuarially calculated point estimate as the starting
point. The actuarial point estimate represents the actuaries' estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the losses that
have occurred at a particular point in time; however, there is inherent uncertainty in the point estimate as it is the expected value in a range of
possible reserve estimates. Similarly, the point estimate for ceded losses is calculated based on the ultimate gross loss amount expected to be paid,
as well as the frequency and severity of the underlying claims, which ultimately determines coverage under the applicable ceded reinsurance
contracts. Therefore, ceded loss estimates are subject to many of the same judgments and assumptions as the gross loss estimates. In some cases,
actuarial analyses, which are generally based on statistical analysis, cannot fully incorporate all of the subjective factors that affect development of
losses. In other cases, management's perspective of these more subjective factors may differ from the actuarial perspective. Subjective factors
influencing the development of management's best estimate include: the credibility and timeliness of claims and loss information received from
cedents and other third parties; and the impacts of economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, changes in underwriting or claims
handling practices, general economic conditions, the risk of moral hazard and other current and developing trends within the insurance and
reinsurance markets, including the effects of competition. For example, the Company's loss experience in recent years has reflected higher than
anticipated levels of economic inflation, as well as the impacts of social inflation, including the rising cost to adjust and settle claims and the impact
of more pervasive litigation financing trends.
Inherent in the Company's reserving practices is the desire to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient, and therefore, will
ultimately prove to be adequate. This approach to establishing loss reserves typically results in loss reserves that exceed the calculated actuarial
point estimate. However, following an acquisition of insurance operations, acquired reserves initially are recorded at fair value, and therefore the
acquired loss reserves may be closer to the actuarial point estimate until the Company builds total loss reserves that are consistent with the
Company's historic level of confidence. Management continually attempts to improve its loss estimation process by refining its ability to analyze loss
development patterns, claim payments and other information, but uncertainty remains regarding the potential for adverse development of estimated
ultimate liabilities.
The Company's ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves. Changes in the Company's estimated ultimate liability for loss reserves
generally occur as a result of the emergence of unanticipated loss activity, the completion of specific actuarial or claims studies or changes in
internal or external factors that impact the assumptions used to derive the Company's estimates. The Company closely monitors new information on
reported claims and uses statistical analyses prepared by its actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of recorded reserves. Management exercises
judgment when assessing the relative credibility of loss development trends.
Management currently believes the Company's gross and net reserves are adequate. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact
of any significant factor on the adequacy of reserves, and actual results will differ from original estimates.

c) Prior Accident Year Loss Development
The following tables summarize, by segment, the product lines with the most significant changes in prior accident years loss reserves for the years
ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, along with the corresponding accident years and the trends and factors that impacted management's
best estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses on underlying products in each of these product lines. The Company does not
estimate losses at this level of aggregation as it offers a diverse portfolio of products and manages these products in logical groupings within each
underwriting segment. As a result of the trends and factors described in the following tables, the Company's actuaries adjusted their estimates of the
ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. For those product lines with favorable development on prior accident years loss
reserves, management has now given more credibility to the favorable trends observed by the Company's actuaries and after also incorporating
these favorable trends into its best estimate, reduced prior years loss reserves accordingly. The unfavorable claims and loss trends experienced on
the Company's U.S. and Bermuda general liability and professional liability product lines in 2023 and 2022 reflected broader market conditions,
including the effects of economic and social inflation, and disrupted the development of the claims trend observed in 2021 and prior years. In 2022,
these changes in trends were most impactful on the 2018 and 2019 accident years for the professional liability product lines and the 2016 to 2019
accident years for the general liability product lines. In 2023, we continued to observe similar trends on those accident years and also determined
that the loss trends on more recent accident years were following a similar loss development trend at the same stage as older accident years.
Consistent with the Company's reserving philosophy, management is responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication of
increased claims frequency or severity in excess of previous expectations, however in instances where trends have been more favorable than
previously anticipated, management will wait to reduce loss reserves until those trends are observed over additional periods of time.

d) Historic Loss Development
The following tables present undiscounted loss development information, by accident year, for the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments,
including cumulative incurred and paid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as well as the corresponding amount of
IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2023. This level of disaggregation is consistent with how the Company analyzes loss reserves for both internal and
external reporting purposes. The loss development information for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2022 is presented as supplementary
information. All amounts included in the following tables related to transactions denominated in a foreign currency have been translated into U.S.
Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2023.
The difference between the segment loss development implied by the tables for the year ended December 31, 2023 and actual losses and loss
adjustment expenses recognized on prior accident years for the Insurance and Reinsurance segments for the year ended December 31, 2023 is
primarily attributed to the fact that amounts presented in these tables exclude amounts attributed to the 2013 and prior accident years. Favorable
development on 2013 and prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $25.9 million for the Insurance segment, reflecting
modest favorable development on the segment's professional liability, marine and energy and general liability product lines. Favorable development
on 2013 and prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $69.4 million for the Reinsurance segment, which was due in part to
lower loss severity than previously anticipated on the segment's professional liability and property product lines. Additionally, within the Reinsurance
segment, net reserves on the 2014 and 2015 accident years decreased $28.1 million as a result of reserves ceded in connection with the retroactive
reinsurance transaction related to the Company's run-off book of U.K.motor casualty business completed in 2023.
The remaining difference between the segment loss development implied by the tables for the year ended December 31, 2023 and actual losses and
loss adjustment expenses on prior accident years is attributed to the fact that amounts presented in these tables exclude unallocated loss
adjustment expenses and amounts attributable to reserve discounting, as well as differences in the presentation of foreign currency movements, as
previously described, none of which are material to the Insurance or Reinsurance segments.
The Insurance segment table that follows also includes claim frequency information, by accident year. The Company defines a claim as a single claim
incident, per policy, which may include multiple claimants and multiple coverages on a single policy. Claim counts include claims closed without a
payment as well as claims where the Company is monitoring to determine if an exposure exists, even if a reserve has not been established.
All of the business contained within the Company's Reinsurance segment represents treaty business that is assumed from other insurance or
reinsurance companies, for which the Company does not have access to the underlying claim counts. Further, this business includes both quota share
and excess of loss treaty reinsurance, through which only a portion of each reported claim results in losses to the Company. As such, the Company
has excluded claim count information from the Reinsurance segment disclosures.

e) The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims primarily resulting from policies written by acquired insurance operations
before their acquisition by the Company. The Company's exposure to A&E claims originated from umbrella, excess and commercial general liability
insurance policies and assumed reinsurance contracts that were written on an occurrence basis from the 1970s to mid-1980s. Exposure also
originated from claims-made policies that were designed to cover environmental risks provided that all other terms and conditions of the policy were
met. A&E claims include property damage and clean-up costs related to pollution, as well as personal injury allegedly arising from exposure to
hazardous materials. Development on A&E loss reserves is monitored separately from the Company's ongoing underwriting operations and is not
included in a reportable segment.
At December 31, 2023, A&E reserves were $132.5 million and $39.6 million on a gross and net basis, respectively. At December 31, 2022, A&E
reserves were $153.2 million and $54.5 million on a gross and net basis, respectively.
The Company's reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to A&E exposures represent management's best estimate of ultimate
settlement values based on statistical analysis of these reserves by the Company's actuaries. A&E exposures are subject to significant uncertainty
due to potential loss severity and frequency resulting from the uncertain and unfavorable legal climate. A&E reserves could be subject to increases in
the future, however, management believes the Company's gross and net A&E reserves at December 31, 2023 are adequate.
12. Reinsurance
In reinsurance and retrocession transactions, an insurance or reinsurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a
premium. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and the
Company will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance or retrocessional
agreement. A credit risk exists with ceded reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the
reinsurance or retrocessional contracts. Allowances are established for credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the reinsurance
recoverables.
Within its underwriting operations, the Company uses reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage its net retention on individual risks and
overall exposure to losses while providing it with the ability to offer policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs.

Within the Company's underwriting operations, balances recoverable at December 31, 2023 from the ten largest reinsurers, by group, represented
65% of the $4.0 billion reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral. As of December 31, 2022, balances
recoverable from the ten largest reinsurers, by group, represented 62% of the $3.1 billion reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance
allowances and collateral. At December 31, 2023, the largest reinsurance balance was due from RenaissanceRe and represented 17% of reinsurance
recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral.
Within its program services and other fronting businesses, the Company generally enters into quota share reinsurance agreements whereby the
Company cedes to the capacity providers (reinsurers) substantially all of its gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of the Company
by a general agent. However, there are certain programs that contain limits on the reinsurers' obligations to the Company that expose the Company
to underwriting risk, including loss ratio caps, exclusions of the credit risk of producers and aggregate reinsurance limits that the Company believes
are unlikely to be exceeded. The Company also remains exposed to the credit risk of the reinsurer, or the risk that one of its reinsurers becomes
insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims. This credit risk is generally mitigated by either selecting well capitalized, highly
rated authorized capacity providers or requiring that the capacity provider post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks, which, in some
instances, exceeds the related reinsurance recoverable.
Within the Company's program services business, balances recoverable at December 31, 2023 from the ten largest reinsurers, by group, represented
56% of the $4.9 billion reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral. As of December 31, 2022, balances
recoverable from the ten largest reinsurers, by group, represented 67% of the $4.9 billion reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance
allowances and collateral. At December 31, 2023, the largest reinsurance balance was due from Knight Insurance Company and represented 10% of
reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral. All of the Company's other fronting business is conducted on
behalf of its Nephila ILS operations; therefore, all of the reinsurance recoverables within these operations are attributable to entities it manages. See
note 18.

13. Life and Annuity Benefits
The Company's run-off block of life and annuity reinsurance contracts consists primarily of Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated life-contingent payout
annuities and traditional and universal life contracts. The following table presents the components of the Company's liabilities for life and annuity
benefits.

10K - 114

The primary component of the Company's liabilities for life and annuity benefits is the liability for future policyholder benefits. Life and annuity
benefit reserves are calculated for aggregated cohorts of contracts, which are determined based on the attributes of the underlying contracts, and
are discounted using standard actuarial techniques and cash flow models. Since the development of the life and annuity reinsurance reserves is
based upon cash flow projection models, the Company makes estimates and assumptions based on cedent experience and industry mortality tables.
The cash flow assumptions used to determine the Company's life and annuity benefit reserves are reviewed, and updated as necessary, at least
annually. The discount rate assumptions are updated at each reporting date. There were no changes to the cash flow assumptions used to measure
the Company's life and annuity benefit reserves in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The following table presents a rollforward of the present value of the
liability for future policyholder benefits.

December 31, 2022).
The Company's 7.35% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2034 are not redeemable. The Company's other unsecured senior notes are
redeemable by the Company at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole premium to the noteholders. None of the Company's senior long-term
debt is subject to any sinking fund requirements.
The Company's other debt is primarily comprised of debt associated with its Markel Ventures subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, debt
at the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries was $339.0 million and $414.1 million, respectively, which includes amounts outstanding on their
respective credit facilities. The Markel Ventures debt is non-recourse to the holding company and generally is secured by the assets of those
subsidiaries.
Various of the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries maintain revolving credit facilities or lines of credit, which provide up to $680 million of
aggregate capacity for working capital and other general operational purposes. A portion of the capacity on certain of these credit facilities may be
used as security for letters of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, $169.5 million and $238.1 million, respectively, of
borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Company's subsidiaries were in compliance with all
covenants contained in their respective credit facilities.

In June 2023, Markel Group and certain insurance subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for its corporate revolving
credit facility, which provides up to $300 million of capacity for future acquisitions, investments and stock repurchases, and for other working capital
and general corporate purposes. At the Company's discretion, up to $200 million of the total capacity may be used for letters of credit. The Company
may increase the capacity of the facility by up to $200 million subject to obtaining commitments for the increase and certain other terms and
conditions. The Company pays interest on balances outstanding under the facility and a utilization fee for letters of credit issued under the facility.
The Company also pays a commitment fee (0.20% at December 31, 2023) on the unused portion of the facility based on the Company's leverage
ratio as calculated under the credit agreement. The credit agreement includes financial covenants that require that the Company not exceed a
maximum debt to capitalization (leverage) ratio and maintain a minimum amount of consolidated net worth, as well as other customary covenants
and events of default. Markel Group guaranteed the obligations under the facility of the insurance subsidiaries that are also parties to the credit
agreement. This facility expires in June 2028. The credit agreement for this revolving credit facility amended and restated the credit agreement for
the Company's previous $300 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its corporate revolving credit
facility.
To the extent that Markel Group or any of its subsidiaries are not in compliance with the covenants under their respective credit facilities, access to
such credit facilities could be restricted.
The Company paid $187.8 million, $197.3 million and $178.6 million in interest on its senior long-term debt and other debt during the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis by taxing jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2023 and
2022, the Company's consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax liabilities of $1.2 billion and $896.7 million, respectively, in other
liabilities and net deferred tax assets of $23.5 million and $37.2 million, respectively, in other assets.
At December 31, 2023, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of $25.4 million, substantially all of which related to foreign tax credits to be used
against U.S. income tax. The Company expects to utilize all tax credit carryforwards before expiration. The earliest any of these credits will expire is
2033.
At December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred tax assets of $32.9 million for U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards and $9.7 million for
foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which are available to offset future taxable income in certain U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions,
respectively. The Company's ability to benefit from the majority of these net operating loss carryforwards is not subject to expiration. As described
below, the deferred tax assets related to losses at certain of the Company's subsidiaries and branches are offset by valuation allowances.
At December 31, 2023, the Company had total gross deferred tax assets of $801.5 million. The Company has a valuation allowance of $13.9 million
to offset gross deferred tax assets primarily attributable to cumulative net operating losses at certain of the Company's subsidiaries and branches.
The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the remaining $787.6 million of gross deferred tax assets through generating
taxable income or the reversal of existing temporary differences attributable to the gross deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, the Company's net
deferred tax liability for investments includes deferred tax assets attributed to its unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities. The Company has
the ability and intent to execute a tax planning strategy such that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized.
10K - 119

At December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any material unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any changes in
unrecognized tax benefits during 2024 that would have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision.
The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's
2017 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company believes its income tax liabilities are adequate as of December 31, 2023, however, these liabilities
could be adjusted as a result of this examination. With few exceptions, including the 2017 U.S. federal income tax return, the Company is no longer
subject to income tax examination by tax authorities for years ended before January 1, 2020.
16. Employee Benefit Plans
a) The Company maintains defined contribution plans for employees of its U.S. insurance operations in accordance with Section 401(k) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Employees of the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries are provided post-retirement benefits under separate
defined contribution plans. The Company also provides various defined contribution plans for employees of its international insurance operations,
which are in line with local market terms and conditions of employment. Expenses relating to the Company's defined contribution plans were $65.4
million, $57.9 million and $52.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
b) The Terra Nova Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the Company's international insurance operations who
meet the eligibility conditions set out in the plan. The plan has been closed to new participants since 2001, and employees have not accrued benefits
for future service in the plan since 2012. The projected benefit obligations of the Terra Nova Pension Plan as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were
$117.3 million and $108.5 million, respectively, and the related fair value of plan assets was $184.6 million and $171.7 million, respectively. The
corresponding net asset for pension benefits, also referred to as the funded status of the plan, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was included in other
assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
17. Variable Interest Entities
MCIM, a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is an insurance-linked securities investment fund manager and reinsurance manager
headquartered in Bermuda. Results attributable to MCIM are not included in a reportable segment.
MCIM serves as the insurance manager for Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (Markel CATCo Re), a Bermuda Class 3 reinsurance company, and as the investment
manager for Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd., a Bermuda exempted mutual fund company comprised of multiple segregated accounts (Markel
CATCo Funds). Voting shares in Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd. and Markel CATCo Re are held by MCIM, which has the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. The Markel CATCo Funds issued multiple classes of nonvoting,
redeemable preference shares to investors, and the Markel CATCo Funds are primarily invested in nonvoting preference shares of Markel CATCo Re.
The underwriting results of Markel CATCo Re are attributed to investors through its nonvoting preference shares. Both Markel CATCo Re and the
Markel CATCo Funds were placed into run-off in July 2019.
In March 2022, the Company completed a buy-out transaction with Markel CATCo Re and the Markel CATCo Funds that provided for an accelerated
return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company provided cash funding of
$45.1 million to purchase substantially all of the Markel CATCo Funds' interests in Markel CATCo Re. As part of the transaction, substantially all of the
preference shares held by investors in the Markel CATCo Funds were redeemed, including preference shares previously held by the Company. See
note 5 for details regarding the Company's investment in the Markel CATCo Funds. In order to complete the transaction, the Company also made
$101.9 million in additional payments, net of insurance proceeds, to or for the benefit of investors, which were recognized as an expense to the
Company and included in services and other expenses in 2022.
During June 2022, the Company received a return of $24.9 million of the capital it provided in March 2022 and the related preference shares were
redeemed. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's investment in the remaining preference shares of Markel CATCo Re totaled
$20.1 million, which comprised 23% of the equity of Markel CATCo Re. Through that investment, the Company has exposure to adverse loss
development on reinsurance contracts previously written by Markel CATCo Re for loss events that occurred from 2014 to 2020. If loss reserves held
by Markel CATCo Re are sufficient to settle claims on the remaining open contracts, the Company will receive a full return of the remaining
$20.1 million in capital. Favorable development on loss reserves held by Markel CATCo Re, less operating expenses, will be distributed to the Markel
CATCo Funds, and ultimately to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds.
10K - 120

Markel CATCo Re is considered a VIE, as the equity at risk does not have the right to receive residual returns that exceed the capital provided by the
Company in the buy-out transaction. As a result of the preference shares acquired by the Company in the buy-out transaction, and the voting shares
held by its consolidated subsidiary, MCIM, the Company consolidates Markel CATCo Re as its primary beneficiary. Results attributed to the run-off of
Markel CATCo Re are reported with the Company's other ILS operations, within services and other revenues and expenses, and are not included in a
reportable segment. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $71.5 million and $89.9 million, respectively, of favorable loss
reserve development on the run-off of reinsurance contracts written by Markel CATCo Re, all of which was included in services and other expenses
and attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $62.6 million and $22.3 million, respectively, of
preference shares of Markel CATCo Re held by noncontrolling interests were redeemed.

In connection with the buy-out transaction, the Company also entered into a tail risk cover with Markel CATCo Re to allow for the release of collateral
to investors. Through this contract, the Company has $95.0 million of uncollateralized exposure to adverse development on loss reserves held by
Markel CATCo Re for loss exposures in excess of limits that the Company believes are unlikely to be exceeded.

provided through its insurance-linked securities operations primarily based on the net asset value of the accounts managed, and, for certain funds,
incentive fees based on their annual performance. Prior to the disposition of Velocity in February 2022, Nephila also provided managing general
agent services to the Nephila Reinsurers in exchange for commissions. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total revenues
attributed to unconsolidated entities managed by Nephila were $97.5 million, $79.5 million and $141.9 million, respectively.

Through the Company's program services and other fronting operations, the Company has programs with Nephila through which the Company writes
insurance policies that are fully ceded to Nephila Reinsurers. Through these programs, Nephila utilizes certain of the Company's licensed insurance
companies to write U.S. catastrophe-exposed property and specialty risks that are then ceded to Nephila Reinsurers. A portion of this business is
placed by Velocity, which the Company retained a minority interest in following its disposition. Additionally, through the Company's insurance
underwriting operations, the Company has a quota share agreement with Nephila through which it cedes a portion of its property business to Nephila
Reinsurers. The following table summarizes the premiums ceded to Nephila Reinsurers.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021
Program services and other fronting:
Gross and ceded written premiums attributable to Nephila programs $ 1,064,121 $ 1,008,851 $ 689,153
Underwriting:
Premiums ceded to Nephila Reinsurers $ 52,295 $ 65,648 $ 54,970
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, reinsurance recoverables on the consolidated balance sheets included $794.3 million and $1.4 billion,
respectively, due from Nephila Reinsurers. Under its programs with Nephila Reinsurers, the Company bears underwriting risk for annual aggregate
agreement year losses in excess of a limit the Company believes is unlikely to be exceeded. To the extent losses under these programs exceed the
prescribed limits, the Company is obligated to pay such losses to the cedents without recourse to the Nephila Reinsurers. While the Company
believes losses under these programs are unlikely, those losses, if incurred, could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations
and financial condition.
The Company has also entered into other assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions with the Nephila Reinsurers in the normal course of business,
which are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In June 2023, the Company sold ISIC, one of the licensed insurance subsidiaries within its program services operations, to Velocity, which resulted in a
gain of $16.9 million during the second quarter of 2023.
Hagerty
The Company holds a minority ownership interest in Hagerty, which operates primarily as a managing general agent and also includes Hagerty
Reinsurance Limited (Hagerty Re), a Bermuda Class 3 reinsurance company. Through the Company's underwriting operations, the Company
underwrites insurance for Hagerty, a portion of which is ceded to Hagerty Re. The amounts attributed to these arrangements are summarized in the
following table.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021
Gross written premiums attributable to Hagerty $ 805,673 $ 689,670 $ 596,904
Premiums ceded to Hagerty Re $ 616,491 $ 456,637 $ 338,850
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, reinsurance recoverables on the consolidated balance sheets included $214.8 million and $159.7 million,
respectively, due from Hagerty Re.
19. Shareholders' Equity
a) The Company has 50,000,000 shares of no par value common stock authorized. The following table presents a rollforward of changes in common
shares issued and outstanding.

b) The Company also has 10,000,000 shares of no par value preferred stock authorized, of which 600,000 shares were issued and outstanding at
December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company has the option to redeem the preferred shares:
• in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90 days after the occurrence of a "rating agency event," at $1,020 per preferred share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends,
• in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90 days after the occurrence of a "regulatory capital event" at $1,000 per preferred share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, or
• in whole or in part, on June 1, 2025, or every fifth anniversary of that date, at $1,000 per preferred share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
A "rating agency event" means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that publishes a rating for the Company amends, clarifies
or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities like the preferred shares, which results in shortening the length of time that the
preferred shares are assigned a particular level of equity credit or in the lowering of the equity credit assigned to the preferred shares.
A "regulatory capital event" means that the Company becomes subject to capital adequacy supervision by a capital regulator and determines that,
under such capital adequacy guidelines, the liquidation preference amount of the preferred shares would not qualify as capital.
The preferred shares rank senior to the Company's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. Holders of the
preferred shares are entitled to receive non-cumulative cash dividends, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, from the original issue
date, semi-annually in arrears on the first day of June and December of each year. The Company accrues dividends when they are declared by the
Board of Directors. To the extent declared, these dividends will accrue, on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, at a fixed annual rate of
6.00% from the original issue date to June 1, 2025. After June 1, 2025, the dividend rate will reset every five years and accrue at an annual rate equal
to the five-year U.S. Treasury Rate as of two business days prior to the reset date, plus 5.662%. Dividends will not be cumulative and will not be
mandatory. Accordingly, if dividends are not declared for any dividend period, then dividends for that dividend period will not accrue and will not be
payable.
For both years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company declared and paid dividends on preferred shares of $36.0 million, or $60.00 per
share.
c) The following table presents net income (loss) per common share and diluted net income (loss) per common share.

(1) The Company has issued grants and awards of restricted stock units to employees as performance, retention or hiring incentives, as well as awards of restricted stock to
non-employee directors, under its equity incentive compensation plan. At December 31, 2023, there were 86,144 shares available for future awards under the Company's
equity incentive compensation plan.
(2) The impact of 33 thousand shares from restricted stock units and restricted stock was excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the year
ended December 31, 2022 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

22. Statutory Financial Information
a) The following table summarizes statutory capital and surplus for the Company's insurance subsidiaries.
December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022
United States $ 5,958,801 $ 5,236,793
United Kingdom $ 977,604 $ 749,495
Bermuda $ 2,353,058 $ 1,895,132
Germany $ 166,403 $ 125,194
As of December 31, 2023, the Company's actual statutory capital and surplus significantly exceeded the regulatory requirements. As a result, the
amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements is not significant in relation to actual statutory capital and
surplus.
The following table summarizes statutory net income (loss) for the Company's insurance subsidiaries.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021
United States $ 196,952 $ 689,341 $ 705,908
United Kingdom $ 116,436 $ 35,719 $ 56,546
Bermuda $ 484,417 $ (144,239) $ 556,275
Germany $ 5,543 $ (2,471) $ 1,780
Amounts presented for the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries have been calculated in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules. For
the Company's international insurance subsidiaries, the regulations that govern the calculation of statutory capital and surplus do not provide
requirements for the calculation of net income. Rather, such amounts are reported in accordance with a basis of accounting permitted by their
respective regulator. Amounts presented for the Company's U.K., Bermuda and German insurance subsidiaries have been calculated in accordance
with U.K. GAAP, U.S. GAAP and German GAAP, respectively.
United States
The laws of the domicile states of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries govern the amount of dividends that may be paid to the holding
company. Generally, statutes in the domicile states of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries require prior approval for payment of extraordinary,
as opposed to ordinary, dividends. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries could pay up to $592.5 million to the holding
company during the following 12 months under the ordinary dividend regulations.
In converting from U.S. statutory accounting principles to U.S. GAAP, typical adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs, differences in the
calculation of deferred income taxes and the inclusion of net unrealized gains or losses relating to fixed maturity securities in shareholders' equity.
The Company does not use any permitted statutory accounting practices that are different from prescribed statutory accounting practices which
impact statutory capital and surplus.

United Kingdom
The Company's U.K. insurance subsidiary, Markel International Insurance Company Limited (MIICL), and its Lloyd's managing agent, Markel Syndicate
Management Limited (MSM), are authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA). The PRA oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements, minimum solvency margins and
individual capital assessment requirements under the Solvency II Directive (Solvency II) and imposes dividend restrictions, while both the PRA and
the FCA oversee compliance with risk assessment reviews and various other requirements. MIICL is required to give advance notice to the PRA for
any transaction or proposed transaction with a connected or related person. MSM is required to satisfy the solvency requirements of Lloyd's. In
addition, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries must comply with the United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006, which provides that dividends may only be
paid out of profits available for that purpose. Earnings of the Company's U.K. insurance subsidiaries are available for distribution to the holding
company to the extent not otherwise restricted.
Bermuda
The Company's Bermuda insurance subsidiary, Markel Bermuda Limited (MBL), is subject to enhanced capital requirements in addition to minimum
solvency and liquidity requirements. The enhanced capital requirement is determined by reference to a risk-based capital model that determines a
control threshold for statutory capital and surplus by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurer's business. At
December 31, 2023, MBL satisfied both the enhanced capital requirements and the minimum solvency and liquidity requirements.
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, MBL is prohibited from paying or declaring dividends during a fiscal year if it is in breach of its enhanced capital
requirement, solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of the dividend would cause a breach of those
requirements. If an insurer fails to meet its solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from
declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Further, MBL is
prohibited from declaring or paying, in any financial year, dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus as set forth in its
previous year's statutory balance sheet unless at least seven days before payment of those dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit stating that it
will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. MBL must obtain the BMA's prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of
the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year's financial statements. In addition, as a long-term insurer, MBL may not declare or pay a
dividend to any person other than a policyholder unless the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by MBL's approved actuary,
exceeds the liabilities of its long-term business. The amount of the dividend cannot exceed the aggregate of that excess and any other funds legally
available for the payment of the dividend. As of December 31, 2023, MBL could pay up to $588.3 million to the holding company during the following
12 months without making any additional filings with the BMA.
Germany
The Company's German insurance subsidiary, Markel Insurance SE, is regulated by the Federal Financial Conduct Authority in Germany and is also
subject to capital and solvency requirements under Solvency II.
b) Lloyd's sets the corporate members' required capital annually based on each syndicates' business plans, rating environment, reserving
environment and input arising from Lloyd's discussions with, among others, regulatory and rating agencies. Such required capital is referred to as
Funds at Lloyd's (FAL) and comprises cash and investments. The amount of cash and investments held as FAL as of December 31, 2023 was $1.0
billion. Of this amount, $380.4 million was provided by the holding company and is not available for general use by the Company. The remaining
amount, provided by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, is not available for distribution to the holding company. The Company's corporate
member may also be required to maintain funds under the control of Lloyd's in excess of its capital requirements and such funds also may not be
available for distribution to the holding company.

As of December 31, 2023, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls),
as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). This evaluation was conducted under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer (PEO) and the Principal Financial Officer (PFO).
Based upon this evaluation, the PEO and PFO concluded that effective Disclosure Controls were in place to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
human failures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of internal control over financial reporting also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that we maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.
KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Markel Group Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Markel Group Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the
related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
