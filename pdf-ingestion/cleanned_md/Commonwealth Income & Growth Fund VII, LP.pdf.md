EXPLANATORY NOTE
The purpose of this amendment on Form 10-K/A to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of COMMONWEALTH INCOME & GROWTH FUND VII, LP for
the year ended December 31, 2021 is to restate our financial statements as of December 31, 2021 as detailed below, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on April 15, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”).
No attempt has been made in this Form 10-K/A to modify or update other disclosures presented in the original report on Form 10-K, except as
required to reflect the effects of the restatement. The Form 10-K/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Form 10-K or modify or
update those disclosures, including the exhibits to the Form 10-K affected by subsequent events. Information not affected by the restatement is
unchanged and reflects the disclosures made at the time of the original filing of the Form 10-K on April 15,2022. Accordingly, this Form 10-K/A
should be read in conjunction with our filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to the filing of the original Form 10-
K, including any amendments to those filings. The following items have been amended as a result of the restatement:
· Part I - Item 1 - Financial Statements
· Part I - Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Description of Restatement
The Partnership owns 34.08% of Commonwealth Opportunity Fund 2, LLC (“COF2”). The Partnership accounts for its investment in COF2 under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 323. Under the equity method, the Partnership records its
proportionate share of the Fund’s net income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership originally recorded a loss on its
investment in COF2 of $69,832, which represented 34.08% of COF2’s 2021 total net loss. Subsequent to the filing of the original Form 10-K, as a
result of an audit of COF2 2021 financial statement, COF2’s original 2021 net loss increased by approximately $129,000. This increase in COF2’s
2021 net loss resulted in an increase in the Partnership’s loss on its investment in COF2 in the amount of $44,000. The Partnership’s 2021 audited
financial statements are restated to account for this increase in the loss on its investment in COF2. The impact of the restatement is as follows:
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 – Investment in COF2 decreased by $44,000, from $546,939 as originally reported to $502,939 as restated.
Total assets decreased $44,000, from $2,418,285 as originally reported to $2,374,285 as restated. Limited partners’ capital account decreased
$44,000, from $1,812,362 as originally reported to $1,768,362 as restated. Total liabilities and partners’ capital decreased $44,000 from
$2,418,285 as originally reported to $2,374,285 as restated.
Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Loss on investment in COF increased $44,000 from $69,832 as originally
reported to $113,832 as restated. Net loss allocated to limited partners increased $44,000, from $394,034 as originally reported to $438,034 as
restated. Net loss per equivalent limited partners unit increase $0.03, from 0.26 as originally reported to $0.29 as restated.
Statement of Partners’ Capital for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Net loss allocated to limited partners increased $44,000, limited partners’
capital account and total capital decreased $44,000.
Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Net loss increased $44,000 from $394,034 as originally reported to $438,034 as
restated. Loss on equity in COF2 investment increased $44,000 from $69,833 as originally reported to $113,833 as restated. Net cash used in
operating activities remained unchanged.

PART I
ITEM 1: BUSINESS
GENERAL
Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund VII, LP (the “Partnership”) is a Pennsylvania limited partnership that was formed on November 14, 2008.
Its General Partner is Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund, Inc., (the “General Partner”), a Pennsylvania corporation which is an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Commonwealth Capital Corp. (“CCC”), and is responsible for managing the affairs of the Partnership on a day-to-day basis
pursuant to the partnership agreement. The General Partner is also responsible for identifying and making investments on behalf of the
Partnership. The offering of limited partnership interests, registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, was declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2009 (the “Effective Date”). As of the Effective Date, the Partnership received an initial
capital contribution of $1,000 from its General Partner. The offering was described in detail in the prospectus constituting a part of such
registration statement. The offering was a best-efforts, minimum/maximum offering, with a minimum requirement of $1,150,000 and a maximum
offering of $50,000,000. All proceeds were held in escrow pending the receipt of the minimum amount. The Partnership reached the minimum
amount in escrow and commenced operations on March 31, 2010. The Partnership utilized the offering proceeds to purchase and lease information
technology, telecommunications, medical technology and other similar types of equipment. The offering terminated on November 22, 2011 with
1,572,900 units sold for a total of approximately $31,432,000 in limited partner contributions. Partnership’s term of existence will expire on
December 31, 2026, though the Partnership may be terminated and dissolved at an earlier or later date.
See “The Glossary” below for the definition of selected terms not otherwise defined in the text of this report.

Table of Contents
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
The Partnership was formed for the purpose of acquiring various types of equipment, including computer information technology and other similar
capital equipment. The Partnership utilized the net proceeds of the offering to purchase information technology and other similar capital
equipment. The Partnership has utilized retained proceeds and debt financing (not in excess of 30% of the aggregate cost of the equipment owned
or subject to conditional sales contract by the Partnership at the time the debt is incurred) to purchase additional equipment. The Partnership
acquires and leases equipment principally to U.S. corporations and other institutions pursuant to operating leases. The Partnership retains the
flexibility to enter into full payout net leases and conditional sales contracts, but has not done so.
The Partnership’s principal investment objectives are to:
(a) acquire, lease and sell equipment to generate revenues from operations sufficient to provide annual cash distributions to Limited Partners;
(b) preserve and protect Limited Partners’ capital;
(c) use a portion of cash flow and net disposition proceeds derived from the sale, refinancing or other disposition of equipment to purchase
additional equipment; and
(d) refinance, sell or otherwise dispose of equipment in a manner that will maximize the proceeds to the Partnership.
THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ATTAINED
Limited Partners do not have the right to vote on or otherwise approve or disapprove of any particular investment to be made by the Partnership.
Although the Partnership generally acquires new equipment, the Partnership may purchase used equipment. Generally, equipment is acquired from
manufacturers, distributors, leasing companies, agents, owner-users, owner-lessors, and other suppliers upon terms that vary depending upon the
equipment and supplier involved. Manufacturers and distributors usually furnish a limited warranty against defects in material and workmanship
and some purchase agreements for equipment provide for service and replacement of parts during a limited period. Equipment purchases are also
made through lease brokers and on an ad hoc basis to meet the needs of a particular lessee.
As of December 31, 2021, all equipment purchased by the Partnership is subject to an operating lease or a finance lease. The Partnership may also
engage in sale/leaseback transactions, pursuant to which the Partnership would purchase equipment from companies that would then immediately
lease the equipment from the Partnership. The Partnership may also purchase equipment which is leased under full payout net leases or sold under
conditional sales contracts at the time of acquisition or the Partnership may enter into a full payout net lease or conditional sales contract with a
third party when the Partnership acquires an item of equipment.
The Partnership may enter into arrangements with one or more manufacturers pursuant to which the Partnership purchases equipment that has
previously been leased directly by the manufacturer to third parties (“vendor leasing agreements”). The Partnership and manufacturers may agree
to obtain non-recourse loans from the manufacturers, to finance the acquisition of equipment. Such loans would be secured only by the specific
equipment financed and the receivables due to the manufacturers from users of such equipment. It is expected that the manufacturers of
equipment will provide maintenance, remarketing and other services for the equipment subject to such agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the
Partnership has no such agreements.
The General Partner has the discretion, consistent with its fiduciary duty, to change the investment objectives of the Partnership if it determines
that such a change is in the best interest of the Limited Partners and so long as such a change is consistent with the Partnership Agreement. The
General Partner will notify the Limited Partners if it makes such a determination to change the Partnership’s investment objectives.

TYPES OF EQUIPMENT
The Partnership invests in various types of equipment subject to leases. Our investment objective is to acquire primarily high technology equipment
including, but not limited to: servers, desktops, laptops, workstations, printers, copiers, and storage devices. Our General Partner believes that
dealing in high technology equipment is particularly advantageous due to a robust aftermarket. Information technology has developed rapidly in
recent years and is expected to continue to do so. Technological advances have permitted reductions in the cost of computer processing capacity,
speed, and utility. In the future, the rate and nature of equipment development may cause equipment to become obsolete more rapidly.
We also may acquire high technology medical, telecommunications and inventory management equipment. Our General Partner will seek to
maintain an appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired. The medical equipment we acquire may consist of IV pumps,
long acute care beds, CT scanners, MRIs, flow cytometers, and other medical technology devices. The telecom equipment we acquire may include
Cisco switches, routers, blade switches, wireless access points, and video conferencing systems. The inventory management equipment we acquire
may consist of inventory control systems, lift trucks and tractors. The market for high technology medical equipment is growing each year.
Generally this type of equipment will have a longer useful life than information technology equipment. This allows for increased re-marketability, if
it is returned before its economic or announcement cycle is depleted.
Other Equipment Restrictions
The Partnership generally acquires information technology, telecommunications and medical technology equipment. The General Partner is also
authorized to cause the Partnership to invest in other types of business-essential capital equipment. The Partnership may not invest in any of such
other types of equipment (i) to the extent that the purchase price of such equipment, together with the aggregate purchase price of all such other
types of equipment then owned by the Partnership, is in excess of 25% of the total cost of all of the assets of the Partnership at the time of the
Partnership’s commitment to invest therein and (ii) unless the General Partner determines that such a purchase is in the best economic interest of
the Partnership at the time of the purchase. There can be no assurance that any equipment investments can be found which meet this standard.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that investments of this type will be made by the Partnership.
DIVERSIFICATION
Diversification is generally desirable to minimize the effects of changes in specific industries, local economic conditions or similar risks. However,
the extent of the Partnership’s diversification, in the aggregate and within each category of equipment, depends in part upon the financing which
can be assumed by the Partnership or borrowed from third parties on satisfactory terms. The Partnership’s policy not to borrow on a recourse basis
will further limit its financing options. Diversification also depends on the availability of various types of equipment. For the year ended December
31, 2021, the Partnership has acquired a diversified equipment portfolio, which it has leased to different companies located throughout the United
States.

Table of Contents
The equipment types comprising the portfolio at December 31, 2021 are as follows:
Approximate
Equipment Category %
Desktops – Tier 1/Laptops 23%
Digital Storage 11%
Forklifts 1%
High End Servers 39%
High Volume & Spec Printers 2%
Inventory Control 3%
Multifunction Centers 7%
Servers/Other 14%
Total 100%
During the operational stage of the Partnership, the Partnership may not at any one point in time lease (or sell pursuant to a conditional sales
contract) more than 25% of the equipment to a single person or affiliated group of persons.
DESCRIPTION OF LEASES
Leases are classified as either sales-type, direct finance or operating at the inception of the lease, with classification affecting pattern of revenue
recognition in the statements of operations. The Partnership’s direct finance and sales-type leases are accounted for as net investment in finance
leases; no significant changes have been made for the accounting of such leases upon the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases (“Topic 842”) on
January 1, 2019.
The Partnership lease transactions are principally accounted for under Topic 842 on January 1, 2019. Prior to Topic 842, the Partnership
accounted for these transactions under Topic 840, Leases (“Topic 840”). Lease revenue includes revenue generated from leasing equipment to
customers, including re-rent revenue, and is recognized as either on a straight line basis or using the effective interest method over the length of
the lease contract, if such lease is either an operating lease or finance lease, respectively.
The Partnership’s sale of equipment along with certain services provided to customers is recognized under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, (“Topic 606”), which was adopted on January 1, 2018. Prior to adoption of Topic 606, the Partnership recognized these
transactions under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognized, and (“Topic 605”). The Partnership recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance
obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the
Partnership expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.
The Partnership generally purchases only equipment that is subject to a lease or for which a lease or similar agreement will be entered into
contemporaneously with the consummation of the Partnership’s acquisition of the equipment. The General Partner leases most of the equipment
purchased by the Partnership to third parties pursuant to operating or finance leases. Types of leases which the General Partner may enter into are
operating leases, finance leases, and conditional sales contracts.
· Operating leases are relatively short-term (12 to 48 month) leases under which the aggregate non-cancellable rental payments during
the original term of the lease are not sufficient to permit the lessor to recover the purchase price of the subject equipment.
· In a finance lease, the lessor generally recovers substantially all of the present value of the equipment during the lease term.

Table of Contents
In general, the terms of the Partnership’s leases, whether the equipment is leased pursuant to an operating lease or a finance lease, depend upon a
variety of factors, including: the desirability of each type of lease from both an investment and a tax point of view; the relative demand among
lessees for operating or full payout leases; the type and use of equipment and its anticipated residual value; the business of the lessee and its credit
rating; the availability and cost of financing; regulatory considerations; the accounting treatment of the lease sought by the lessee or the
Partnership; and competitive factors.
An operating lease generally represents a greater risk to the Partnership than a finance lease, because in order to recover the purchase price of the
subject equipment and earn a return on such investment, it is necessary to renew or extend the operating lease, lease the equipment to a third
party at the end of the original lease term, or sell the equipment. On the other hand, the term of an operating lease is generally much shorter than
the term of a finance lease, and the lessor is thus afforded an opportunity under an operating lease to re-lease or sell the subject equipment at an
earlier stage of the equipment’s life cycle than under a finance lease. Also, the annual rental payments received under an operating lease are
ordinarily higher than those received under a finance lease.
The Partnership’s policy is to generally enter into “triple net leases” which typically provide that the lessee or some other party bear the risk of
physical loss of the equipment; pay taxes relating to the lease or use of the equipment; maintain the equipment; indemnify the Partnership-lessor
against any liability suffered by the Partnership as the result of any act or omission of the lessee or its agents; maintain casualty insurance in an
amount equal to the greater of the full value of the equipment and a specified amount set forth in the lease; and maintain liability insurance naming
the Partnership as an additional insured with a minimum coverage which the General Partner deems appropriate. In addition, the Partnership may
purchase “umbrella” insurance policies to cover excess liability and casualty losses, to the extent deemed practicable and advisable by the General
Partner. As of December 31, 2021, all leases that have been entered into are “triple net leases.”
The terms and conditions of the Partnership’s leases are each determined by negotiation and may impose substantial
obligations upon the Partnership. Where the Partnership assumes maintenance or service obligations, the General Partner generally causes the
Partnership to enter into separate maintenance or service agreements with manufacturers or certified maintenance organizations to provide such
services. Such agreements generally require annual or more frequent adjustment of service fees. As of December 31, 2021, the Partnership has not
entered into any such agreements.
Investment Criteria
When evaluating potential lease transactions in which we will invest, the general partner and the CCC’s management team performs a detailed
credit and risk analysis of both the lessee and the lease transaction itself. The risk of doing business with the potential lessee and the economics of
each particular transaction must both be acceptable to our portfolio management team and to the CEO of the General Partner, who specifically
approves each and every lease transaction. Some of the criteria we evaluate are described below:
Evaluation of Lessees
The management team will perform a credit analysis (including a review of the financial statements, credit history and public debt record) of all
potential lessees to determine the lessee’s ability to make payments under the lease. We focus our investments in investment grade to middle
market credits meeting our minimum acceptable fundamental analysis criteria. These criteria involve an overall fundamental assessment of the
lessee, and application of our own proprietary “rating” model that is tailored to specific economic criteria that are important to us. In addition to
preparing a detailed credit-write up at the time of initiation of a transaction, we also re-evaluate a lessee’s credit risk on a monthly basis, and may
review interim and annual lessee financial statements.
Generally, we seek lessees that have annual revenue of at least $10 million, have positive cash flow, and are not start-up entities, i.e., have been in
business for at least five years. We will also apply a proprietary debt rating analysis when a Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s rating is not available.
This allows us to create an equivalent, internal rating system without reliance solely on third-party models and analysis.

Table of Contents
Evaluation of Transactions
As described above under “Description of Leases,” we prefer our lease investments to have a term of 12 to 36 months, and will not invest in a lease
greater than 48 months. We engage in “Fair Market Value” lease transactions, which permit the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of
term for no less than the then fair market value of the equipment. We seek to limit or avoid leases that allow for early buyouts or terminations, as
these arrangements reduce the predictability of our returns.
Our focus is on Tier 1 (Tier 1 is defined as a large and well-known vendor, often enjoying national or international recognition and acceptance. Tier
1 vendors may be both manufacturers and value-added resellers) information technology, telecommunications, and medical technology equipment,
leased in transactions generally ranging in size from $50,000 to $1,000,000. We will consider larger transactions, but for diversification purposes
will require such transactions to be divided among multiple lease schedules, and the general partner may even assign a portion of such larger
transactions to other affiliated funds to further spread the risk involved in larger transactions. Also, where the equipment type and economic
analytics are advantageous, we may engage in lease transactions involving other types of equipment, so long as we feel it is business-essential
equipment for the lessee. Also, we conduct a detailed analysis, using a third-party consultant, to assess the residual value of the proposed
equipment at the end of the original lease term. This includes an analysis of the equipment’s useful life and depreciation schedule, as well as the
expected resale market of that equipment type and availability of remarketing channels.
Finally, in assessing whether a proposed lease transaction will fit into our portfolio criteria, management will consider the amount of exposure we
and our affiliated funds have to (i) the proposed asset type, (ii) the particular lessee, (iii) the lessee’s industry, and (iv) the geographic location of
the equipment to be leased.
BORROWING POLICIES
The General Partner, at its discretion, may cause the Partnership to incur debt in the maximum aggregate amount of 30% of the aggregate cost of
the equipment owned by the Partnership, or subject to conditional sales contracts. The Partnership will incur only non-recourse debt that is secured
by equipment and lease income therefrom. Such leveraging permits the Partnership to increase the aggregate amount of its depreciable assets,
and, as a result, potentially increases both its lease revenues and its federal income tax deductions above the levels that would be achieved without
leveraging. There is no limit on the amount of debt that may be incurred in connection with the acquisition of any single item of equipment. Any
debt incurred is fully amortized over the term of the initial lease or conditional sales contract to which the equipment securing the debt is subject.
The precise amount borrowed by the Partnership depends on a number of factors, including the types of equipment acquired by the Partnership;
the creditworthiness of the lessee; the availability of suitable financing; and prevailing interest rates. There can be no assurance that credit will be
available to the Partnership in the amount or at the time desired or on terms considered reasonable by the General Partner. As of December 31,
2021, the Partnership’s aggregate nonrecourse outstanding debt of approximately $121,000 was approximately 0.9% of the aggregate cost of the
equipment owned. The notes are secured by specific equipment with a carrying value of approximately $207,000 at December 31, 2021 and are
nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership.
The Partnership may purchase some items of equipment without leverage. If the Partnership purchases an item of equipment without leverage and
thereafter suitable financing becomes available, it may then obtain the financing, secure the financing with the purchased equipment and invest
any proceeds from such financing in additional items of equipment. Any such financing will be on terms consistent with the terms applicable to
borrowings in general.
The General Partner may cause the Partnership to borrow funds, to the fullest extent practical, at interest rates fixed at the time of borrowing.
However, the Partnership may borrow funds at rates that vary with the “prime” or “base” rate. If lease revenues were fixed, a rise in the “prime” or
“base” rate would increase borrowing costs and reduce the amount of the Partnership’s income and cash available for distribution. Therefore, the
General Partner is permitted to borrow funds to purchase equipment at fluctuating rates only if the lease for such equipment provides for
fluctuating rental payments calculated on a similar basis.
Any additional debt incurred by the Partnership must be nonrecourse. Nonrecourse debt means that the lender providing the funds can look for
security only to the equipment pledged as security and the proceeds derived from leasing or selling such equipment. Neither the Partnership nor
any Partner (including the General Partner) would be liable for repayment of any nonrecourse debt.

Table of Contents
Loan agreements may also require that the Partnership maintain certain reserves or compensating balances and may impose other obligations
upon the Partnership. Moreover, since a significant portion of the Partnership’s revenues from the leasing of equipment will be reserved for
repayment of debt, the use of financing reduces the cash, which might otherwise be available for distributions until the debt has been repaid and
may reduce the Partnership’s cash flow over a substantial portion of the Partnership’s operating life. As of December 31, 2021 the Partnership had
not entered into any such agreements.
The General Partner and any of its affiliates may, but are not required to, make loans to the Partnership on a short-term basis. If the General
Partner or any of its affiliates makes such a short-term loan to the Partnership, the General Partner or affiliate may not charge interest at a rate
greater than the interest rate charged by unrelated lenders on comparable loans for the same purpose in the same locality. In no event is the
Partnership required to pay interest on any such loan at an annual rate greater than three percent over the “prime rate" from time to time
announced by PNC Bank, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. All payments of principal and interest on any financing provided by the General Partner or
any of its affiliates are due and payable by the Partnership within 12 months after the date of the loan.
REFINANCING POLICIES
Subject to the limitations set forth in “Borrowing Policies” above, the Partnership may refinance its debt from time to time. With respect to a
particular item of equipment, the General Partner will take into consideration such factors as the amount of appreciation in value, if any, to be
realized, the possible risks of continued ownership, and the anticipated advantages to be obtained for the Partnership, as compared to selling such
equipment. As of December 31, 2021, the Partnership has not entered into any debt refinancing transactions.
Refinancing, if achievable, may permit the Partnership to retain an item of equipment and at the same time to generate additional funds for
reinvestment in additional equipment or for distribution to the Limited Partners.
LIQUIDATION POLICIES
The General Partner intends to cause the Partnership to begin the liquidation phase approximately 10 years after commencement of operations.
Notwithstanding the Partnership’s objective to sell all of its assets and dissolve by December 31, 2026, the General Partner may cause the
Partnership to dispose of all its equipment and dissolve the Partnership sooner, if warranted by economic conditions.
Particular items of equipment may be sold at any time if, in the judgment of the General Partner, it is in the best interest of the Partnership to do
so. The determination of whether particular items of Partnership equipment should be sold or otherwise disposed of is made by the General Partner
after consideration of all relevant factors (including prevailing general economic conditions, lessee demand, the General Partner’s views of current
and future market conditions, the cash requirements of the Partnership, potential capital appreciation, cash flow and federal income tax
considerations), with a view toward achieving the principal investment objectives of the Partnership. As partial payment for equipment sold, the
Partnership may receive purchase money obligations secured by liens on such equipment.
MANAGEMENT OF EQUIPMENT
Equipment management services for the Partnership’s equipment are provided by the General Partner and its affiliates and by persons employed by
the General Partner. Such services will consist of collection of income from the equipment, negotiation and review of leases, conditional sales
contracts and sales agreements, releasing and leasing-related services, payment of operating expenses, periodic physical inspections and market
surveys, servicing indebtedness secured by equipment, general supervision of lessees to assure that they are properly utilizing and operating
equipment, providing related services with respect to equipment, supervising, monitoring and reviewing services performed by others with respect
to equipment and preparing monthly equipment operating statements and related reports.

COMPETITION
The equipment leasing industry is highly competitive. The Partnership competes with leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and their
affiliated financing companies, distributors and entities similar to the Partnership (including other programs sponsored by the General Partner),
some of which have greater financial resources than the Partnership and more experience in the equipment leasing business than the General
Partner. Other leasing companies and equipment manufacturers, their affiliated financing companies and distributors may be in a position to offer
equipment to prospective lessees on financial terms, which are more favorable, than those which the Partnership can offer. They may also be in a
position to offer trade-in privileges, software, maintenance contracts and other services, which the Partnership may not be able to offer. Equipment
manufacturers and distributors may offer to sell equipment on terms (such as liberal financing terms and exchange privileges or service contracts),
which will afford benefits to the purchaser similar to those obtained through leases. Other competitive factors include pricing, technological
innovation and methods of financing. Certain manufacturer-lessors maintain advantages through patent protection, where applicable, and through
a policy that combines service and hardware with payment accomplished through a single periodic charge. As a result of the advantages, which
certain of its competitors may have, the Partnership may find it necessary to lease its equipment on a less favorable basis than certain of its
competitors.
INVESTMENTS
The Partnership, through CCC, participates in the purchase of equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease agreements. The
purchase price, list price and monthly rentals presented below represent the Partnership’s share of the total amounts, based on CCC’s allocation of
the equipment to the Partnership, and in some instances, other affiliated partnerships.
For the period of January 1, 2021 through April 15, 2022, the Partnership has purchased, or has made the commitment to purchase, the following
equipment:
Pro-rated
Purchased Purchase
Lessee Equipment Category Term Price
Prestige Care Inc Canon Multifunction Centers 48 $ 39,439.37
Taylor Farms California Forklift 48 $ 76,631.43
Intellifreight Industrial Precision 48 $ 25,604.63
Alliant Techsystems Konica Multifunction Centers 12 $ 12,481.20
Hofstra University Apple Desktops/Laptops 12 $ 5,628.90
Prestige Care Inc Canon Multifunction Centers 12 $ 35,968.80
Vista Outdoor Inventory Control Systems 12 $ 23,243.22
RESERVES
Because the Partnership’s leases are on a “triple-net” basis, no permanent reserve for maintenance and repairs has been established from the
offering proceeds. However, the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may retain a portion of the cash flow and net disposition proceeds available
to the Partnership for maintenance, repairs and working capital. There are no limitations on the amount of cash flow and net disposition proceeds
that may be retained as reserves. Since no reserve will be established, if available cash flow of the Partnership is insufficient to cover the
Partnership’s operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary for the Partnership to obtain additional funds by refinancing its equipment or
borrowing additional funds.

GENERAL RESTRICTIONS
Under the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is not permitted, among other things, to:
a) invest in junior trust deeds unless received in connection with the sale of an item of equipment in an aggregate amount that does not
exceed 30% of the assets of the Partnership on the date of the investment;
b) invest in or underwrite the securities of other issuers;
c) acquire any equipment for units;
d) issue senior securities (except that the issuance to lenders of notes or other evidences of indebtedness in connection with the financing
or refinancing of equipment or the Partnership’s business shall not be deemed to be the issuance of senior securities);
e) make loans to any person, including the General Partner or any of its affiliates, except to the extent a conditional sales contract
constitutes a loan;
f) sell or lease any equipment to, lease any equipment from, or enter into any sale- leaseback transactions with, the General Partner or
any of its affiliates; or
g) give the General Partner or any of its affiliates an exclusive right or employment to sell the Partnership’s equipment.
The General Partner has also agreed in the Partnership Agreement to use its best efforts to assure that the Partnership shall not be deemed an
“investment company” as such term is detained in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The General Partner and its affiliates may engage in other activities, whether or not competitive with the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement
provides, however, that neither the General Partner nor any of its affiliates may receive any rebate or “give up” in connection with the
Partnership’s activities or participate in reciprocal business arrangements that circumvent the restrictions in the Partnership Agreement against
dealings with affiliates.
EMPLOYEES
The Partnership had no employees during 2021 and received administrative and other services from a related party, CCC, which had 28 employees
as of December 31, 2021.
PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS
On March 1, 2020, the General Partner (“GP”) relocated the Partnership’s principal place of business to 4532 US Highway 19, Suite 200, New Port
Richey, Florida, 34652. The GP’s telephone and fax numbers remains the same, (877) 654-1500, Fax: (727)450-5360.
ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS
COVID-19 Pandemic
The amount of revenue recognized and the pattern of revenue recognition may be impacted by COVID-19. In December 2019, a strain of
coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, and on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization
(“WHO”) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United
States, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, quarantines, and other public health safety measures. Such government-imposed
precautionary measures may have been relaxed in certain countries or states, but there is no assurance that more strict measures will be put in
place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. In addition, the COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread
health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact the
Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pattern of revenue recognition may change for delays in rendering services.
12

Table of Contents
In periods ended subsequent to the outbreak of COVID-19, the impact on expected credit losses and future cash flow projections used in
impairment testing will need to be considered.
The Partnership continues to evaluate whether adjustments to the financial statements are required or whether additional disclosures are
necessary. In our leasing business, the Company is always subject to credit losses as it relates to a customer’s ability to make timely rental
payments. The impact of COVID-19 may contribute to risk of non-performance, where a customer may experience financial difficulty and may delay
in making timely payments.
The Partnership recognizes impairment of receivables and loans when losses are incurred, which is when it is probable that an entity will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the arrangement. Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the receivable’s or loans effective interest rate, except that, as a practical expedient, impairment can be measured
based on a receivable’s or loans’ observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.
The Partnership believes its estimate of expected losses have been recognized based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable
forecasts. The impacts of COVID-19 may necessitate additional adjustments in future forecasts of expected losses.
Although the Partnership cannot estimate the length or gravity of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at this time, if the pandemic continues, it
may have a material adverse effect on the Partnership results of future operations, financial position, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
FINRA
On May 3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a complaint naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp. (“CCSC”) and the owner
of the firm, Kimberly Springsteen-Abbott, as respondents; however, on October 22, 2013, FINRA filed an amended complaint that dropped the
allegations against CCSC and reduced the scope of the allegations against Ms. Springsteen-Abbott. The sole remaining charge was that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott had approved the misallocation of some expenses to certain Funds. Management believes that the expenses at issue include
amounts that were proper and that were properly allocated to Funds, and also identified a smaller number of expenses that had been allocated in
error, but were adjusted and repaid to the affected Funds when they were identified in 2012. During the period in question, Commonwealth
Capital Corp. (“CCC”) and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to the Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and
voluntarily waived fees in amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned allocations. A Hearing Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated approximately
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of three years. As such, management had already at that time reallocated back
approximately $151,225 of the $208,000 (in allegedly misallocated expenses) to the affected funds, which was fully documented, as good faith
payments for the benefit of those Income Funds.

Table of Contents
The decision of the Hearing Panel was stayed when it was appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory Council (the “NAC”) pursuant to FINRA Rule
9311. The NAC issued a decision that upheld the lower panel’s ruling and the bar took effect on August 23, 2016. Ms. Springsteen-Abbott
appealed the NAC’s decision to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). On March 31, 2017, the SEC criticized that decision as
so flawed that the SEC could not even review it, and remanded the matter back to FINRA for further consideration consistent with the SEC’s
remand, but did not suggest any view as to a particular outcome.
On July 21, 2017, FINRA reduced the list of 1,840 items totaling $208,000 to a remaining list of 87 items totaling $36,226 (which includes
approximately $30,000 of continuing education expenses for personnel providing services to the Funds), and reduced the proposed fine from
$100,000 to $50,000, but reaffirmed its position on the bar from the securities industry. Respondents promptly appealed FINRA’s revised ruling to
the SEC. All the requested or allowed briefs have been filed with the SEC. Despite offering no additional evidence or legal reasoning from when
SEC originally remanded this matter (for FINRA’s opinion being an unreviewably flawed opinion), the SEC upheld FINRA’s new order on February
7, 2020 as to the bar; however, FINRA’s fine was voided. Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has filed a Petition for Review in the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review a final order entered against her by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On
February 26, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, made their ruling. They dismissed in part and denied in
part Ms. Springsteen-Abbott’s petition. This was regardless of CCC’s good faith reimbursements made many years ago of the questioned expense
items of $208,000 (due to improper documentation), initially claimed misallocations by FINRA, even prior to FINRA’s reducing its final claim to
$36,226.
Prior to the original appeal to the SEC, Ms. Springsteen-Abbott discovered CCC’s required documentation of these items for FINRA review, which
FINRA refused to consider, despite such efforts the District Court upheld the bar, despite admittingly not addressing her “due process” rights, for
legal administrative procedural reasons. However, given the SEC’s prior removal of FINRA’s fine and the District Court upholding that removal,
the General Partner anticipates that this ruling will not result in any material financial impact to the Funds.

PART II
ITEM 5: MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES
There is no public market for the units nor is it anticipated that one will develop. As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,003 unit holders. The units
are not listed on any exchange or permitted to trade on any over-the-counter market. In addition, there are substantial restrictions on the
transferability of units.
GENERAL LIMITATIONS
Units cannot be transferred without the consent of the General Partner, which may be withheld in its discretion according to the Partnership
Agreement. The General Partner monitors transfers of units in an effort to ensure that all transfers are within certain safe harbors promulgated by
the IRS to furnish guidance regarding publicly traded partnerships. These safe harbors limit the number of transfers that can occur in any one year.
The General Partner intends to cause the Partnership to comply with the safe harbor that permits nonexempt transfers and redemptions of units of
up to five percent of the total outstanding interest in the Partnership’s capital or profits in any one year.
REDEMPTION PROVISION
The Partnership may, at the sole discretion of the General Partner, repurchase a number of the outstanding units pursuant to its limited redemption
plan. On a semi-annual basis, the General Partner, at its discretion, may establish an amount for redemption, generally not to exceed two percent of
the outstanding units per year, subject to the General Partner’s good faith determination that such redemptions will not (a) cause the Partnership
to be taxed as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code or (b) impair the capital or operations of the Partnership. (The Partnership may
redeem units in excess of the two percent limitation if, in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, the conditions imposed in the preceding
sentence would remain satisfied.) The redemption price for units will be 105% of the selling Limited Partner’s adjusted capital contributions
attributable to the units for sale. Following the determination of the annual redemption amount, redemptions will occur on a semi-annual basis and
all requests for redemption, which must be made in writing, must be on file as of the record date with respect to which the redemption is to occur.
The General Partner will maintain a master list of requests for redemption with priority being given to units owned by estates, followed by IRAs and
qualified plans. All other requests will be considered in the order received. Redemption requests made by or on behalf of Limited Partners who are
not affiliated with the General Partner or its affiliates will be given priority over those made by Limited Partners who are affiliated with the General
Partner or its affiliates. All redemption requests will remain in effect until and unless canceled, in writing, by the requesting Limited Partner(s).
15

Table of Contents
The Partnership began accepting redemption requests beginning 30 months following the termination of the public offering of its units. There are
no limitations on the period of time that a redemption request may be pending prior to
it being granted. Limited Partners will not be required to hold their interest in the Partnership for any specified period prior to their making a
redemption request.
In order to make a redemption request, Limited Partners will be required to advise the General Partner in writing of such request. Upon receipt of
such notification, the Partnership will provide detailed forms and instructions to complete the request. Since the Partnership began to accept
redemptions, through December 31, 2021, the General Partner had granted redemption requests to redeem approximately 43,000 units. During
the year ended December 31, 2021, limited partners redeemed 7,750 units of the partnership for a total redemption price of approximately $56,683
in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, limited partners redeemed 4,571 units
of the partnership for a total redemption price of approximately $34,627 in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement.
EXEMPT TRANSFERS
The following seven categories of transfers are exempt transfers for purposes of calculating the volume limitations imposed by the IRS and will
generally be permitted by the General Partner:
1) transfers in which the basis of the unit in the hands of the transferee is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to its basis in the
hands of the transferor (for example, units acquired by corporations in certain reorganizations, contributions to capital, gifts of units,
units contributed to another partnership, and non-liquidating as well as liquidating distributions by a parent partnership to its partners
of interests in a sub partnership);
2) transfers at death;
3) transfers between members of a family (which include brothers and sisters, spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants);
4) transfers resulting from the issuance of units by the Partnership in exchange for cash, property, or services;
5) transfers resulting from distributions from qualified plans;
6) any transfer by a Limited Partner in one or more transactions during any 30-day period of units representing in the aggregate more
than five percent of the total outstanding interests in capital or profits of the Partnership; and
7) transfers by one or more partners representing in the aggregate fifty percent (50%) or more of the total interests in partnership’s
capital or profits in one transaction or a series of related transactions.
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
Limited Partners who wish to transfer their units to a new beneficial owner are required to pay the Partnership up to $50 for each transfer to cover
the Partnership’s cost of processing the transfer application and take such other actions and execute such other documents as may be reasonably
requested by the General Partner. There is no charge for re-registration of a unit in the event of a marriage, divorce, death, or transfer to a trust so
long as the transfer is not a result of a sale of the units.
16

Table of Contents
In addition, the following restrictions apply to each transfer: (i) no transfer may be made if it would cause 25% or more of the outstanding units to
be owned by benefit plans; and (ii) no transfer is permitted unless the transferee obtains such governmental approvals as may reasonably be
required by the General Partner, including without limitation, the written consents of the Pennsylvania Securities Commissioner and of any other
securities agency or commission having jurisdiction over the transfer.
ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE GENERAL PARTNER AND THE LIMITED PARTNERS
Cash distributions, if any, are made quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year. Distributions are made 99% to
the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until the Limited Partners has received an amount equal to their Capital Contributions plus the
Priority Return of 10% per annum; thereafter, cash distributions will be made 90% to Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partner.
Distributions made in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership or a Partner’s Units will be made in accordance with the Partner’s positive
capital account balance as determined under the Partnership Agreement and Treasury Regulations.
The priority return is calculated on the Limited Partners’ adjusted capital contributions for their units. The adjusted capital contributions will
initially be equal to the amount paid by the Limited Partners for their units. If distributions at any time exceed the priority return, the excess will
reduce the adjusted capital contributions, decreasing the base on which the priority return is calculated.
If the proceeds resulting from the sale of any equipment are reinvested in equipment, sufficient cash will be distributed to the Partners to pay the
additional federal income tax resulting from such sale for a Partner in a 35% federal income tax bracket or, if lower, the maximum federal income
tax rate in effect for individuals for such taxable year.
Generally, the General Partner is allocated net profits equal to its cash distributions (but not less than one percent of net profits) and the balance is
allocated to the Limited Partners. Net profits arising from transactions in connection with the termination or liquidation of the Partnership are
allocated in the following order: (1) First, to each Partner in an amount equal to the negative amount, if any, of his capital account; (2) Second, an
amount equal to the excess of the proceeds which would be distributed to the Partners based on the operating distributions to the Partners over the
aggregate capital accounts of all the Partners, to the Partners in proportion to their respective shares of such excess, and (3) Third, with respect to
any remaining net profits, to the Partners in the same proportions as if the distributions were operating distributions. Net losses, if any, are in all
cases allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and one percent to the General Partner.
Net profits and net losses are computed without taking into account, in each taxable year of the Partnership, any items of income, gain, loss or
deduction required to be specially allocated pursuant to Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulation promulgated thereunder. No
Limited Partner is required to contribute cash to the capital of the Partnership in order to restore a closing capital account deficit, and the General
Partner has only a limited deficit restoration obligation under the Partnership Agreement.
Distributions in the following approximate amounts declared to the Limited Partners for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as
follows:
Quarter Ended 2021 2020
March 31 $ - $ -
June 30 - -

Table of Contents
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG THE LIMITED PARTNERS
Cash available for distribution that is allocable to the Limited Partners is apportioned among and distributed to them solely with reference to the
number of units owned by each as of the record date for each such distribution.
Net profits, net losses and cash available for distribution allocable to the Limited Partners is apportioned among them in accordance with the
number of units owned by each.
In addition, where a Limited Partner transfers units during a taxable year, the Limited Partner may be allocated net profits for a period for which
such Limited Partner does not receive a corresponding cash distribution.
ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
NOT APPLICABLE
ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion of our current financial position and results of operations. This discussion should be read together with the
Partnership’s financial statements contained under Item 8 of this Annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion should also be read in conjunction
with the disclosures above regarding “Forward-Looking Statements.”
INTRODUCTION
We were formed for the purpose of acquiring various types of business-essential technology equipment, including computer information technology,
telecommunications, medical technology and other similar capital equipment. We offered for sale up to 2,500,000 units of the limited partnership at
the purchase price of $20 per unit in a public offering that commenced on November 13, 2009 (the “Offering”). We reached the minimum offering
amount, broke escrow and commenced operations on March 31, 2010. A total of 1,572,900 units were sold in the offering, for a total of
approximately $31,432,000 in limited partner contributions.
Our management team consists of the officers of our corporate General Partner, Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund, Inc. We have utilized the
net proceeds of our public offering to purchase equipment that is subject to leases with businesses throughout the United States. We have also
utilized debt financing (not in excess of 30% of the aggregate cost of the equipment owned or subject to conditional sales contracts at the time the
debt is incurred) to purchase additional equipment. We acquire and lease equipment principally to U.S. corporations and other institutions
pursuant to operating and finance leases. We retain the flexibility to enter into full payout net leases and conditional sales contracts, but have not
done so.
COMPETITIVE OUTLOOK
As discussed in “Competition” in Item 1 above, the commercial leasing and financing industry is highly competitive and is characterized by
competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. We compete primarily on the basis of pricing, terms and structure,
particularly on structuring flexible, responsive, and customized financing solutions for our customers. Our investments are often made directly
rather than through competition in the open market. This approach limits the competition for our typical investment, which is intended to enhance
returns. We believe our investment model will represent the best way for individual investors to participate in investing in business-essential
equipment. Nevertheless, to the extent that our competitors compete aggressively on any combination of the foregoing factors, our results could be
adversely impacted.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
Our principal investment objectives are to:
acquire, lease and sell equipment to generate revenues from operations sufficient to provide annual cash distributions to our limited partners;
a) preserve and protect limited partners’ capital;
b) use a portion of cash flow and net disposition proceeds derived from the sale, refinancing or other disposition of equipment to purchase
additional equipment; and
c) refinance, sell or otherwise dispose of equipment in a manner that will maximize proceeds.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
We invest in various types of domestic information technology equipment leases located solely within the United States. Our investment objective is
to acquire primarily high technology equipment. We believe that dealing in high
technology equipment is particularly advantageous due to a robust aftermarket. Information technology has developed rapidly in recent years and
is expected to continue to do so. Technological advances have permitted reductions in the cost of computer processing capacity, speed, and utility.
In the future, the rate and nature of equipment development may cause equipment to become obsolete more rapidly. In an effort to mitigate this
risk our portfolio manager attempts to diversify our fund through the acquisition of different types of equipment, staggered lease maturities,
various lessees, and businesses located throughout the U.S., and industries served.
We also acquire high technology medical, telecommunications and inventory management equipment. Our General Partner seeks to maintain an
appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired. The market for high technology medical equipment is growing each year.
Generally, this type of equipment has a longer useful life. This allows for increased re-marketability, if it is returned before its economic or
announcement cycle is depleted.
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association’s (ELFA) Monthly Leasing and Finance Index (MLFI-25), which reports economic activity from 25
companies representing a cross section of the $900 billion equipment finance sector, showed their overall new business volume for December was
$11.8 billion, down 3 percent year-over-year from new business volume in December 2020. Volume was up 49 percent month-to-month from $7.9
billion in November in a typical end-of-year spike. Cumulative new business volume for 2021 was up almost 9 percent compared to 2020.
Receivables over 30 days were 2.0 percent, down from 2.2 percent the previous month and down from 2.2 percent in the same period in 2020.
Charge-offs were 0.25 percent, up from 0.20 percent the previous month and down from 0.59 percent in the year-earlier period.
Credit approvals totaled 78.6 percent, up from 77.2 percent in November. Total headcount for equipment finance companies was down 7.9 percent
year-over-year, a decrease due to significant downsizing at an MLFI reporting company.
Separately, the Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation’s Monthly Confidence Index (MCI-EFI) in January is 63.9, unchanged from the December
index.
ELFA President and CEO Ralph Petta said, “The association’s Q4 MLFI-25 equipment finance industry metrics show responding organizations
reporting robust growth in new business activity as well as healthy portfolios, indicative of another solid year. Cumulative 2021 originations grew
about 9 percent when compared to 2020, the first year impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses in many industry sectors grew and
expanded during the past 12 months, reflecting a favorable low interest rate environment, healthy corporate earnings and strong balance
sheets. The outlook for the industry, and indeed overall economy, is somewhat cloudy, with unabated inflation, the Fed poised to increase interest
rates, equities markets in a recent tailspin, and the Omicron variant remaining a concerning health factor in the U.S.”
19

Table of Contents
Kalyan Makam, Executive Vice President, Amur Equipment Finance, said, “Supply constraints, strong economic growth, and the early innings of the
American Jobs Plan augur well for the equipment finance sector in 2022. That said, rising Omicron cases have prolonged the price inflation and
supply chain troubles across the country. As well, the jump in medium term rates over the last few weeks may challenge margins for lenders.”
Our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political, and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative
and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies, and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Given these
circumstances, we believe companies overall, will continue to increasingly turn to leasing, as a financing solution. It is our belief that companies
lease business-essential equipment because leasing can provide many benefits to a company. The number one benefit of leasing that we see is that
there is no large outlay of cash required. Therefore, companies can preserve their working capital, lease equipment, which is an expense item, have
the flexibility to upgrade the equipment when needed, and have no risk of obsolescence. Because we expect leasing to remain an attractive
financing solution for American businesses during the next 12 months, we feel that our ability to increase our portfolio size and leasing revenues
during that period will remain strong.
We, at Commonwealth, are currently operating business as usual (with our employees working remotely). We may see a slowdown on new
equipment acquisition decisions from Corporate Lessees until the crisis is resolved and businesses can resume their normal operation. We have no
way of knowing what this period of time will be. We will keep our investors informed of subsequent events. For information relating to COVID-19
and the overall effects, as expressed by Ralph Petta, President of ELFA (The Equipment Leasing & Finance Association), please refer to
elfaonline.org.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that our critical
accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and complex estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Partnership is principally engaged in business of leasing equipment. Ancillary to the Partnership’s principal equipment leasing business, the
Partnership also sells certain equipment and may offer certain services to support its customers.
The Partnership’s lease transactions are principally accounted for under Topic 842 on January 1, 2019. Prior to Topic 842, the Partnership
accounted for these transactions under Topic 840, Leases (“Topic 840”). Lease revenue includes revenue generated from leasing equipment to
customers, including re-rent revenue, and is recognized as either on a straight line basis or using the effective interest method over the length of
the lease contract, if such lease is either an operating lease or finance lease, respectively.
The Partnership’s sale of equipment along with certain services provided to customers is recognized under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, (“Topic 606”), which was adopted on January 1, 2018. Prior to adoption of Topic 606, the Partnership recognized these
transactions under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognized, and (“Topic 605”). The Partnership recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance
obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the
Partnership expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.
20

Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership’s lease portfolio consisted of operating leases and finance leases. For operating leases,
lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement. Finance lease interest income is recorded
over the term of the lease using the effective interest method.
Upon the end of the lease term, if the lessee has not met the return conditions as set out in the lease, the Partnership is entitled in certain cases to
additional compensation from the lessee. The Partnership’s accounting policy for recording such payments is to treat them as revenue.
Gains or losses from sales of leased and off-lease equipment are recorded on a net basis in the Partnership’s Statement of Operations. Gains from
the termination of leases are recognized when the lease is modified and terminated concurrently. Our leases do not contain any step-rent
provisions or escalation clauses nor are lease revenues adjusted based on any index.
Partnership’s accounting policy for sales and property taxes collected from the lessees are presented in the current period as gross revenues and
expenses.
Long-Lived Assets
Depreciation on technology and inventory management equipment for financial statement purposes is based on the straight-line method estimated
generally over useful lives of two to five years. Once an asset comes off lease or is released, the Partnership reassesses the useful life of an asset.
The Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may not be recoverable. The
Partnership determines whether impairment exists by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each asset. If the estimated
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset then impairment exists. The amount of the impairment is determined based on
the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by
the asset, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets, as applicable, based on asset type.
Residual values are determined by management and are calculated using information from both internal and external sources, as well as other
economic indicators.
Reimbursable Expenses
Reimbursable expenses are comprised of both ongoing operational expenses and fees associated with the allocation of salaries and benefits,
referred to as other LP expenses. Reimbursable expenses, which are charged to the Partnership by CCC in connection with the administration and
operation of the Partnership, are allocated to the Partnership based upon several factors including, but not limited to, the number of investors,
compliance issues, and the number of existing leases. For example, if a partnership has more investors than another program sponsored by CCC,
then higher amounts of expenses related to investor services, including mailing and printing costs will be allocated to that partnership. Also, while
a partnership is in its offering stage, higher compliance costs are allocated to it than to a program not in its offering stage, as compliance resources
are utilized to review incoming investor suitability and proper documentation. Finally, lease related expenses, such as due diligence,
correspondence, collection efforts and analysis and staff costs, increase as programs purchase more leases, and decrease as leases terminate and
equipment is sold. All of these factors contribute to CCC’s determination as to the amount of expenses to allocate to the Partnership or to other
sponsored programs. CCC is not reimbursed for salary and benefit costs of control persons. For the Partnership, all reimbursable items are
expensed as they are incurred.
Lease Income Receivable
Lease income receivable includes current lease income receivable net of allowances for uncollectible amounts, if any. The Partnership monitors
lease income receivable to ensure timely and accurate payment by lessees. The Partnership’s Lease Relations department is responsible for
monitoring lease income receivable and, as necessary, resolving outstanding invoices.

Table of Contents
The Partnership reviews a customer’s credit history before extending credit. When the analysis indicates that the probability of full collection is
unlikely, the Partnership may establish an allowance for uncollectible lease income receivable based upon the credit risk of specific customers,
historical trends and other information. The Partnership writes off its lease income receivable when it determines that it is uncollectible and all
economically sensible means of recovery have been exhausted.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary source of cash for the year ended December 31, 2021, was net proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately $322,000. Our
primary sources of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, were cash provided by operating activities of approximately $6,000, net proceeds
from the sale of equipment of approximately $228,000, and distributions from investment in COF 2 of approximately $4,000.
Our primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2021 were for cash used in operating activities of approximately $606,000, capital
expenditures of approximately $150,000, limited partner redemptions of approximately $57,000 and equipment acquisition fees paid to the General
Partner of approximately $600. Our primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 were for capital expenditures of approximately
$228,000, limited partner redemptions of approximately $35,000, equipment acquisition fees paid to the General Partner of approximately $18,000
and debt placement fees paid the General Partner of approximately $2,000.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 cash was used in operating activities of approximately $606,000, which included a net loss of approximately
$438,000 and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $904,000. Other noncash activities included in the determination of net loss
include direct payments of lease income by lessees to banks of approximately $351,000. For the year ended December 31, 2020 cash was provided
by operating activities of approximately $6,000, which included a net loss of approximately $510,000, depreciation and amortization expense of
approximately $1,346,000 and bad debt expense of approximately $115,000. Other noncash activities included in the determination of net loss
include direct payments of lease income by lessees to banks of approximately $1,085,000.
At December 31, 2021, cash was held in one bank account maintained at one financial institution with an aggregate balance of approximately
$18,000. Bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total cash bank balance was
approximately as follows:
Balance at December 31 2021 2020
Total bank balance $ 18,000 $ 501,000
FDIC insured (18,000) (250,000)
Uninsured amount $ - $ 251,000
The Partnership believes it mitigates the risk of holding uninsured deposits by only depositing funds with major financial institutions. The
Partnership has not experienced any losses in our accounts, and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk. The amounts in such
accounts will fluctuate throughout 2022 due to many factors, including the pace of cash receipts, equipment acquisitions, interest rates and
distributions to limited partners.
As of December 31, 2021, we had future minimum rentals on operating leases of approximately $150,000 for 2022 and approximately $73,000
thereafter. These amounts represent scheduled payments on existing leases only, and do not include expected future revenues on leases that we
have not yet entered into as of December 31, 2021.
22

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2021, we had future minimum rentals on non-cancellable finance leases of approximately $12,000 for 2022 and $23,000
thereafter. These amounts represent payments on existing leases only, and do not include expected future revenues on leases that we have not yet
entered into as of December 31, 2021.
The balance of our non-recourse debt at December 31, 2021 was approximately $121,000 with interest rates ranging from 4.10% to 5.00% which
will be payable through November, 2024. Non-recourse debt leases will not generate current cash flow because the rental payments received from
these leases are used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipate that the
equipment will generate income to the investor either through an extension of the lease term or from the sale of the equipment at the end of the
lease term. Management does not expect significant interest rate increases to take place during 2022, and therefore expects our cost of
nonrecourse borrowing to remain steady over the next 12 months.
CCC, on our behalf and on behalf of affiliated partnerships, acquires equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease agreements and
allocates a participation in the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various partnerships based on certain risk factors. The Partnership’s share of the
cost of the equipment in which it participates with other partnerships at December 31, 2021 was approximately $6,229,000 and is included in the
Partnership’s equipment on its balance sheet. The Partnership’s share of the outstanding debt associated with this equipment at December 31,
2021 was approximately $76,000 and is included in the Partnership’s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total cost of the equipment shared by
the Partnership with other partnerships at December 31, 2021 was approximately $14,952,000. The total outstanding debt related to the equipment
shared by the Partnership at December 31, 2021 was approximately $305,000.
As the Partnership and the other programs managed by the General Partner increase their overall portfolio size, opportunities for shared
participation are expected to continue. Sharing in the acquisition of a lease portfolio gives the fund an opportunity to acquire additional assets and
revenue streams, while allowing the fund to remain diversified and reducing its overall risk with respect to one portfolio.
Our cash flow from operations is expected to continue to be adequate to cover all operating expenses, liabilities, and distributions to limited
partners during the next 12-month period. If available cash flow or net disposition proceeds are insufficient to cover our expenses and liabilities on
a short and long term basis, we will attempt to obtain additional funds by disposing of or refinancing equipment, or by borrowing within its
permissible limits. We may also reduce the distributions to limited partners if our management deems it necessary.
On August 13, 2015, the Partnership purchased 1,648 units for $1,500,000, of Commonwealth Opportunity Fund 2 (“COF 2”), an affiliate fund of
the General Partner. In accordance with the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is permitted to invest in equipment programs formed by the
General Partner or its affiliates. COF 2 is an affiliate program that broke escrow on August 13, 2015. The General Partner believes this action is in
the best interests of all the Programs. The Partnership accounts for its investment in COF 2 under the equity method in accordance with ASC 323.
The Partnership’s net investment in COF 2 at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $502,000 and $617,000, respectively. For the year
ended December 31, 2021, COF 2 declared distributions to the Partnership of approximately $0 of which approximately $0 was paid in 2021 and
approximately $0 is recorded as a receivable from COF 2 at December 31, 2021.
RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue of approximately $1,514,000, expenses of approximately $1,838,000 and other loss
of approximately $113,000, resulted in a net loss of approximately $438,000. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue of
approximately $1,939,000, expenses of approximately $2,480,054 and other gain of approximately $31,000, resulted in a net loss of approximately
$510,000. The reduction in net loss is primarily due to more leases were expiring than new leases acquiring as well as an overall reduction in
expenses including but not limited to, depreciation and amortization expense, equipment management fees and legal fees, partially offset by a
decline in overall revenue.
The Partnership had 36 active operating leases that generated lease revenue of approximately $1,233,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021
and had 58 active operating leases that generated lease revenue of approximately $1,798,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management
expects to add new leases to Partnership’s portfolio throughout 2022, primarily through debt refinancing. The Partnership is continuously
monitoring its lessee concentration to potentially reduce the risk associated with a high concentration of activity in a few lessees.
23

Table of Contents
The Partnership’s equipment portfolio consists of approximately 39% high end servers, 23% desk and lap tops, 14% servers\other, 11% digital
storage, 7% multifunction centers, 3% inventory control systems\printers and 2% high volume & spec printers. The General Partner continuously
monitors and seeks to decrease the concentration of equipment by type to diversify the equipment portfolio and potentially reduce the overall risk
to the investor. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership had a total of three lessees that accounted for lease revenue of 10% or
greater which are as follows: 43%, 27% and 11%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership had a total of four lessees that
accounted for lease revenue of 10% or greater which are as follows: 38%, 24%, 16% and 13%.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, consisted of accounting, legal,
outside service fees, reimbursement of expenses to CCC and other LP charges from CCC for administration and operations as discussed in Note 6
of the financial statements. Operating expenses were approximately $586,000 and $802,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This decline is
primarily due to decreases in “Other LP” expenses charged by CCC for the administration of the Partnership by approximately $127,000, legal fees
of approximately $83,000, office relocation expenses of approximately $13,000, dues/subscriptions expenses of approximately $5,000, outside office
services expenses of approximately $4,000 and other insurance expenses of approximately $4,000, partially offset by increases in temporary
services expenses of approximately $21,000.
We pay an equipment management fee to our General Partner for managing our equipment portfolio. The equipment management fee is
approximately 5% of the gross lease revenue attributable to equipment that is subject to operating leases and 2% of the gross lease revenue
attributable to equipment that is subject to finance leases. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, equipment management fees were
approximately $62,000 and $86,000, respectively, which is consistent with the decrease in lease revenue.
Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on equipment and amortization of equipment acquisition fees and initial direct
costs. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, these expenses were approximately $899,000 and $1,346,000, respectively. This
decrease was due to the higher frequency in the termination of leases and equipment being fully depreciated as compared to the acquisition of new
leases for the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Partnership recorded a gain on the sale of equipment of approximately $197,000 and
$59,000, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Partnership reported bad debt expense of approximately $215,000 and $115,000,
respectively.
Net loss was approximately $438,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This net loss was attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses
as discussed above. Net loss was approximately $510,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The changes in net loss were attributable to the
changes in revenue and expenses as discussed above.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer
has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information that it is required to disclose in reports that the Company files with
the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act rules and regulations.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
It is the responsibility of the General Partner to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules 13a¬15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The General Partner’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Partnership are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the General Partner; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021. Management based
this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)”. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of
the design of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the board of directors.
As of December 31, 2021, management completed an effective assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework. Management has concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S. GAAP. Management identified the following material
weakness set forth below in our internal control over financial reporting. This period reporting error was caused by 2 contributing factors. First, as
indicated in the prospectus, the General Partner manages multiple funds with similar objectives, therefore there could be conflicts of interest which
could affect timing issues of reporting. When the decision was made on other funds to later write off certain receivables, as it affected this fund as
well, it caused a timing conflict with the originally filed 10K, resulting in this 10K-A, correcting those adjustments. Additionally, as previously
disclosed, the longer term effects that the post pandemic economic climate has had on corporate credit losses, has affected certain lessee’s ability
to make timely payments to the fund, thereby causing adjusting entries to financial reporting. Management has implemented a new control
concerning timing issues to correct this.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
controls over financial reporting because this is not required of the Company pursuant to Regulation S-K Item 308(b).
Changes in Internal Controls
There were no changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting.
ITEM 9B: OTHER INFORMATION
FUND VALUATION
Background to Fund Valuation
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), updated rules for the presentation of pricing of Alternative Investment shares in customer
account statements. Under NTM 15-02, the SEC approved amendments to Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements and FINRA Rule 2310, which
address a FINRA member firm’s participation in a public offering of an Alternative Investment. The amendments require a FINRA member firm to
include a per share value of each Alternative Fund. The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016. This per share value must be prepared by,
or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service. The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the
issuer’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This valuation must be performed and published, at a minimum, annually.
Methodologies
Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed Alternative fund held by
their customers. These methods must be reasonably designed to provide a reliable value. The two methods acceptable are as follows:
· Net Investment Methodology – This method must be based on the “amount available for investment” percentage disclosed in the
“Estimated Use of Proceeds” section of the issuer’s offering prospectus. The value should equal the offering price less selling
commission and organization and offering expenses. This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of
the “escrow break” of each fund.
· Appraised Value Methodology – This method must be disclosed in an issuer’s most recent periodic or current report based upon an
appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third- party valuation
expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to their specific assets and liabilities. No later
than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer’s break of escrow, this methodology must be used.

Table of Contents
For Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund VII, it’s estimated per share value includes the General Partner’s estimate of the current market value
of the fund. This value may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity. Additionally,
there is no public market for the Units and as a result, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. The estimate does not
take into account any future distributions or returns to Unit holders over the full course of the Fund life cycle.
Valuation Components & Calculations
A. Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below): The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as
current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values.
Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements.
B. Investments in leases (net of fees and expenses): The estimated values for Investments in leases are based on a calculation for the
projected future cash flows. Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions of
lease renewals and sale value (Equipment Valuation) of the residual assumptions.
Residual value assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows:
· For Leased Extensions and Month-to-Month Leases: Considers historical renewal periods for Commonwealth’s leases over
the last five years as of December 31, 2021.
· For Off-Lease (Inventory): A realized residual of 25% of the installed equipment valuation as of the appraisal date.
· Special Situation Leases: The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon
specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above due to the specific situations of those leases.
C. Syndication costs: Syndication costs for the Funds have been added to the value and are assumed to be amortized over the expected 10
to 12-year life of the Fund.
D. Net Book Value: The Net Book Value is the unamortized portion left during expected life of the asset with an inflation rate of 1.5%
added to the value times 324% for the expected Commonwealth Capital return on investment. Inventory assets do not include the 324%
factor.
E. Cash on Hand: Cash available for reinvestment as of the appraisal date.
Procedure for December 31, 2021 Fund Valuation
The Fund valuation for December 31, 2021 for Commonwealth Capital Corp. was accomplished by using spreadsheet and lease contract data
provided by Commonwealth for the Funds with the following additional data and updates added to each Fund spreadsheet:
26

Table of Contents
Columns added to each Fund spreadsheet (with formula calculation):
Category: Each lease has an assigned category based on the type of asset in the lease. i.e. IBM 4250 Server would be valued as a “Server”
with a decline rate for Installed Fair Market Value from 1 month to 96 months. There are 12 separate decline rate tables to value
Commonwealth’s leased assets.
Net Book Value: Prorated Purchase price/48 month or 36-month. Typically, 12 months beyond initial term not to exceed 48 months.
Calculations as described earlier.
Age of Asset: Months as of Valuation Date: The actual age of the asset from installation date.
Lease, Extension, MTM, Payments as of Appraisal Date: The number of months remaining in Initial Term of the lease; number of months
remaining in a fixed term extension; plus, a fixed term based on the Commonwealth historical return for similar assets over the last five
years. All Active, Extension and MTM leases add 10 months to their current term as of the appraisal date except for certain repeat lessees
with long term recurring activity, which have a fixed 12-month extension added to any of their Active, Extension or MTM leases.
Other Calculations: Another calculation is made at the bottom of each spreadsheet for the equipment off-lease (inventory) and in the
Commonwealth warehouse or other locations. It is “Equity Only” (Inventory) and is calculated at 25% of the Installed Fair Market Value
from the Category tables.
Commonwealth Income and Growth Fund VII, Unit Valuation
The General Partner’s estimated per unit value at December 31, 2021 as determined and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value
Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations is $1.74.
Disclaimer
The foregoing Fund valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory
mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable basis for use in assigning an estimation
of Unit holder’s account value. Any statement of such valuations is to be accompanied by statements that the value so calculated does not represent
an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its
assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund’s term. Further, each Fund’s valuations is to be accompanied by a disclosure that
there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund
seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, (4) the amount of
asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in
distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term.
ITEM 10: DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GENERAL
The Partnership does not have any Directors or executive officers. Rather, it is managed by the Manager. The directors and officers of the
Manager are required to spend only such time on Partnership affairs as is necessary for the proper conduct of Partnership business. Under certain
circumstances, such directors and officers are entitled to indemnification from the Partnership. The Manager reserves the right to determine now
and in the future which personnel are deemed control persons and, therefore would not seek reimbursement for personnel costs related to such
persons. It is not intended that every person who carries a title such as director, vice president, executive vice president, senior vice president,
manager, secretary, controller or treasurer or who holds a 5% equity interest be considered a Controlling Person.
The Board of Directors of the Sponsor has established an Executive Committee, and the operations of the Manager are effectively controlled by the
Executive Committee of the Sponsor. The Executive Committee has functional control over all day-to-day activities of the Sponsor and effectively
the Manager. Currently, Kimberly A. Springsteen-Abbott and Henry J. Abbott are the members of the Executive Committee. Kimberly A.
Springsteen-Abbott is the sole shareholder of Commonwealth Capital Corp., and thus retains ultimate control of all Commonwealth entities through
her ability to elect, remove and replace directors. Prior to mid-2011, only Ms. Springsteen-Abbott was considered a controlling person of the
Commonwealth-sponsored equipment funds and Mr. Abbott is currently a controlling person with respect to the equipment funds as well, with the
goal being that Executive Committee membership will be indicative of control over the income funds as well as the Sponsor. For purposes of our
financial operations, we do not currently consider any other employees to be control persons, and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.

The directors and officers of the General Partner are required to spend only such time on the Partnership’s affairs as is necessary in the sole
discretion of the directors of the General Partner for the proper conduct of the Partnership’s business. A substantial amount of time of such
directors and officers is expected to be spent on matters unrelated to the Partnership, particularly after the Partnership’s investments have been
selected. Under certain circumstances, such directors and officers are entitled to indemnification from the Partnership.
The Partnership has no audit committee financial expert, as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR § 229.401) under the Exchange Act,
serving on its audit committee. An audit committee is not required because the Partnership’s units are not listed securities (as defined by 17 CFR
§ 240.10A-3); therefore, no audit committee financial expert is required.

In view of the fiduciary obligation that the General Partner has to the Partnership, the General Partner believes an adoption of a formal code of
ethics is unnecessary and would not benefit the Partnership, particularly, in light of Partnership's limited business activities.
ITEM 11: EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Partnership does not have any Directors or executive officers.
ITEM 12: SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
NONE
ITEM 13: CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The following table summarizes the types, amounts and recipients of compensation to be paid by the Partnership directly or indirectly to the
General Partner and its affiliates. Some of these fees are paid regardless of the success or profitability of the Partnership’s operations and
investments. While such compensation and fees were established by the General Partner and are not based on arm’s-length negotiations, the
General Partner believes that such compensation and fees are comparable to those that would be charged by an unaffiliated entity or entities for
similar services. The Partnership Agreement limits the liability of the General Partner and its affiliates to the Partnership and the Limited Partners
and provides indemnification to the General Partner and its affiliates under certain circumstances.

The General Partner Debt Placement Fee. As compensation for arranging term debt to $ - $ 2,000
finance our acquisition of equipment, we will pay the general partner a
fee equal to one percent of such indebtedness; provided, however, that
such fee shall be reduced to the extent we incur such fees to third parties
unaffiliated with the general partner or the lender with respect to such
indebtedness. No such fee will be paid with respect to borrowings from
the general partner or its affiliates. We intend to initially acquire leases
on an all cash basis with the proceeds of this offering, but may borrow
funds after the offering proceeds have been invested. The amount we
borrow, and therefore the amount of the fee, will depend upon interest
rates at the time of a loan, and the amount of leverage we determine is
appropriate at the time. We do not intend to use more than 30% leverage
overall in our portfolio. Fees will increase as the amount of leverage we
use increases, and as turnover in the portfolio increases and additional
equipment is purchased using leverage.
The General Partner Equipment Management Fee. A monthly fee equal to the lesser of (a) $ 62,000 $ 86,000
the fees which would be charged by an independent third party in the
same geographic market for similar services and similar equipment or (b)
the sum of (i) two percent of the gross lease revenues attributable to
equipment subject to full payout net leases which contain net lease
provisions and (ii) five percent of the gross lease revenues attributable to
equipment subject to operating leases and (iii) two percent of the gross
lease revenues attributable to equipment subject to finance leases.
The General Partner Equipment Liquidation Fee. With respect to each item of equipment $ 10,000 $ 8,000
sold by the general partner, a fee equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of the
competitive equipment sale commission or (ii) three percent of the sales
price for such equipment. The payment of this fee is subordinated to the
receipt by the Limited Partners of (i) a return of their capital
contributions and 10% annum cumulative return, compounded daily, on
adjusted capital contributions and (ii) the net disposition proceeds from
such sale in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Such fee is
reduced to the extent any liquidation or resale fees are paid to
unaffiliated parties.
The General Partner Partnership Interest and Distribution. The General Partner has a $ - $ -
present and continuing one percent interest of $1,000 in the
Partnership’s item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and tax
preference. In addition, the General Partner receives one percent of cash
available for distribution until the Limited Partners have received
distributions of cash available for Distribution equal to their capital
contributions plus the 10% cumulative return and thereafter, the General
Partner will receive 10% of cash available for distribution.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Partnership is subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of its relationships with the General Partner and its affiliates. These conflicts
include the following:
COMPETITION WITH GENERAL PARTNER AND AFFILIATES: COMPETITION FOR MANAGEMENT’S TIME
The General Partner and its affiliate sponsor other investor programs, which are potentially in competition with the Partnership in connection with
the purchase of equipment as well as opportunities to lease and sell such equipment. Competition for equipment has occurred and is likely to occur
in the future. The General Partner and its affiliates may also form additional investor programs, which may be competitive with the Partnership.
If one or more investor programs and the Partnership are in a position to acquire the same equipment, the General Partner will determine which
program will purchase the equipment based upon the objectives of each and the suitability of the acquisition in light of those objectives. The
General Partner will generally afford priority to the program or entity that has had funds available to purchase equipment for the longest period of
time. If one or more investor programs and the Partnership are in a position to enter into a lease with the same lessee or sell equipment to the
same purchaser, the General Partner will generally afford priority to the equipment which has been available for lease or sale for the longest period
of time.
Certain senior executives of the General Partner and its affiliates also serve as officers and directors of the other programs and are required to
apportion their time among these entities. The Partnership is, therefore, in competition with the other programs for the attention and management
time of the General Partner and affiliates. The officers and directors of the General Partner are not required to devote all or substantially all of their
time to the affairs of the Partnership.
ACQUISITIONS
CCC and the General Partner or other affiliates of the General Partner may acquire equipment for the Partnership provided that (i) the Partnership
has insufficient funds at the time the equipment is acquired, (ii) the acquisition is in the best interest of the partnership and (iii) no benefit to the
General Partner or its affiliates arises from the acquisition except for compensation paid to CCC, the General Partner or such other affiliate as
disclosed in this Report. CCC, the General Partner or their affiliates will not hold equipment for more than 60 days prior to transfer to the
Partnership. If sufficient funds become available to the Partnership within such 60 day period, such equipment may be resold to the Partnership for
a price not in excess of the sum of the cost of the equipment to such entity and any accountable acquisition expenses payable to third parties which
are incurred by such entity and interest on the purchase price from the date of purchase to the date of transfer to the Partnership. CCC, the
General Partner or such other affiliate will retain any rent or other payments received for the equipment, and bear all expenses and liabilities, other
than accountable acquisition expenses payable to third parties with respect to such equipment, for all periods prior to the acquisition of the
equipment by the Partnership. Except as described above, there will be no sales of equipment to or from any affiliate of CCC.
In certain instances, the Partnership may find it necessary, in connection with the ordering and acquisition of equipment, to make advances to
manufacturers or vendors with funds borrowed from the General Partner for such purpose. The Partnership does not borrow money from the
General Partner or any of its affiliates with a term in excess of twelve months. Interest is paid on loans or advances (in the form of deposits with
manufacturers or vendors of equipment or otherwise) from the General Partner of its affiliates from their own funds at a rate equal to that which
would be charged by third party financing institutions on comparable loans from the same purpose in the same geographic area, but in no event in
excess of the General Partner’s or affiliate’s own cost of funds. In addition, if the General Partner or its affiliates borrow money and loan or advance
it on a short-term basis to or on behalf of the Partnership, the General Partner or such affiliates shall receive no greater interest rate and financing
charges from the Partnership than that which unrelated lenders charge on comparable loans. The Partnership will not borrow money from the
General Partner or any of its affiliates for a term in excess of twelve months.
33

Table of Contents
If the General Partner or any of its affiliates purchases equipment in its own name and with its own funds in order to facilitate ultimate purchase by
the Partnership, the purchaser is entitled to receive interest on the funds expended for such purchase on behalf of the Partnership. Simple interest
on any such temporary purchases is charged on a floating rate basis not in excess of three percent over the “prime rate” from time to time
announced by PNC Bank, from the date of initial acquisition to the date of repayment by the Partnership and ownership transfer.
The Partnership does not invest in equipment limited partnerships, general partnerships or joint ventures, except that (a) the Partnership may
invest in general partnerships or joint ventures with persons other than equipment programs formed by the General Partner or its affiliates, which
partnerships or joint ventures invest in specific equipment; provided that (i) the Partnership has or acquires a controlling interest in such ventures
or partnerships, (ii) the non-controlling interest is owned by a non-affiliated, and (iii) there are no duplicate fees; and (b) the Partnership may invest
in joint venture arrangements with other equipment programs formed by the General Partner or its affiliates if such action is in the best interest of
all programs and if all the following conditions are met: (i) all the programs have substantially identical investment objectives; (ii) there are no
duplicate fees; (iii) the sponsor compensation is substantially identical in each program; (iv) the Partnership has a right of first refusal to buy
another program’s interest in a joint venture if the other program wishes to sell equipment held in the joint venture; (v) the investment of each
program is on substantially the same terms and conditions; and (vi) the joint venture is formed either for the purpose of effecting appropriated
diversification for the programs or for the purpose of relieving the General Partner or its affiliates from a commitment entered into pursuant to
certain provisions of the Partnership Agreement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Partners
Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund VII, LP
New Port Richey, Florida
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund VII, LP (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2021 and
2020, and the related statements of operations, partners’ capital, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Restatement of financial statements
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2021 have been restated to correct a misstatement.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the general partner and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

(Continued)
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
As discussed in Note 3, Topic, Long-Lived Assets, once an asset comes off lease or is released, the Partnership reassesses the useful life of an asset.
The Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may not be recoverable. The
Partnership determines whether impairment exists by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each asset. If the estimated
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset then impairment exists. The amount of the impairment is determined based on
the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by
the asset, third party appraisals, or comparable sales of similar assets, as applicable, based on asset type.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of long-lived assets is a critical audit
matter are the use of significant judgment and subjective factors in the Partnership’s assessment of any changes in events or circumstances that
may affect the carrying amount of its long-lived assets.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
financial statements. These procedures included the following:
· Reviewed the internal controls over the Partnership’s impairment assessment process for equipment
· Reviewed the valuation method for appropriateness
· Reviewed the specialized skills and knowledge of the valuation professional
· Tested the estimated fair value to an independent service
Reimbursable Expenses
As discussed in Note 3, Topic, Reimbursable Expenses, reimbursable expenses are ongoing operational expenses and fees associated with the
allocation of salaries and benefits which are charged to the Partnership by Commonwealth Capital Corp. (CCC) in connection with the
administration and operation of the Partnership are allocated to the Partnership based upon several factors including, but not limited to, the
number of investors, compliance issues, and the number of existing leases.
We identified the allocation of reimbursable expenses as a critical audit matte due to a high degree of subjectivity in the selection of certain key
factors.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of certain internal controls over CCC’s allocation process.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
financial statements. These procedures included the following:
· Evaluated that the reimbursement is in compliance with the Partnership Agreement
· Evaluated the reasonableness and consistency of key factors used by CCC to allocate the ongoing operational expenses
· Tested the dollar amounts in the key factors to the accounting records of the partnerships included in the allocation
· Tested the calculation of the allocation percentage applied to the Partnership
· Confirmed that the operational expenses do not include costs of control persons
/s/ Morison Cogen LLP
We have served as the Partnership’s auditors since 2021.

Commonwealth Income &
Growth Fund VII, LP
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Business
Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund VII, LP (the “Partnership”) is a limited partnership organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on
November 14, 2008. The Partnership offered for sale up to 2,500,000 units of limited partnership interest at the purchase price of $20 per unit (the
“offering”). The Partnership reached the minimum amount in escrow and commenced operations on March 31, 2010. The offering terminated on
November 22, 2011 with 1,572,900 units sold for a total of approximately $31,432,000 in limited partner contributions.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, limited partners redeemed 7,750 and 4,571 units, respectively, of partnership interest for a total
redemption price of approximately $56,683 and $34,627, respectively, in accordance with the terms of the Partnership’s Limited Partnership
Agreement (the “Agreement”).
The Partnership uses the proceeds of the offering to acquire, own and lease various types of computer information technology equipment and other
similar capital equipment, which is leased primarily to U.S. corporations and institutions. Commonwealth Capital Corp. (“CCC”), on behalf of the
Partnership and other affiliated partnerships, acquires computer equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease agreements and
allocates a participation in the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various partnerships based on certain risk factors.
The Partnership’s investment objective is to acquire primarily high technology equipment. Information technology has developed rapidly in recent
years and is expected to continue to do so. Technological advances have permitted reductions in the cost of information technology processing
capacity, speed, and utility. In the future, the rate and nature of equipment development may cause equipment to become obsolete more rapidly.
The Partnership also intends to acquire high technology medical, telecommunications and inventory management equipment. The Partnership’s
general partner will seek to maintain an appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired. The market for high technology
medical equipment is growing each year. Generally, this type of equipment will have a longer useful life than other types of technology equipment.
This allows for increased re-marketability, if it is returned before its economic or announcement cycle is depleted.
The Partnership’s general partner is Commonwealth Income & Growth Fund, Inc. (the “General Partner”), a Pennsylvania corporation which is an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CCC. CCC is a member of the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (“IPA”) and the Equipment Leasing and
Finance Association (“ELFA”). Approximately ten years after the commencement of operations, the Partnership intends to sell or otherwise dispose
of all of its equipment, make final distributions to partners, and to dissolve. Unless sooner terminated or extended pursuant to the terms of its
Limited Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”), the Partnership will continue until December 31, 2026.
Allocations of income and distributions of cash are based on the Agreement. The various allocations under the Agreement prevent any limited
partner’s capital account from being reduced below zero and ensure the capital accounts reflect the anticipated sharing ratios of cash distributions,
as defined in the Agreement. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash distributions to limited partners for each quarter
were made at a rate of approximately 0% and 0% of their original contributed capital, respectively. Distributions during each of the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020 were made to limited partners in the amount of approximately $0 and $0 per unit, respectively, based on each
investor's number of limited partnership units outstanding during that year.

2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
The Partnership owns 34.08% of Commonwealth Opportunity Fund 2, LLC (“COF2”). The Partnership accounts for its investment in COF2 under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 323. Under the equity method, the Partnership records its
proportionate share of the Fund’s net income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership originally recorded a loss on its
investment in COF2 of $69,832, which represented 34.08% of COF2’s 2021 total net loss. Subsequent to the filing of the original Form 10-K, as a
result of an audit of COF2 2021 financial statement, COF2’s original 2021 net loss increased by approximately $129,000. This increase in COF2’s
2021 net loss resulted in an increase in the Partnership’s loss on its investment in COF2 in the amount of $44,000. The Partnership’s 2021 audited
financial statements are restated to account for this increase in the loss on its investment in COF2. The impact of the restatement is as follows:
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 – Investment in COF2 decreased by $44,000, from $546,939as originally reported to $502,939 as restated.
Total assets decreased $44,000, from $2,418,285 as originally reported to $2,374,285 as restated. Limited partners’ capital account decreased
$44,000, from $1,812,362 as originally reported to $1,768,362 as restated. Total liabilities and partners’ capital decreased $44,000 from
$2,418,285 as originally reported to $2,374,285 as restated.
Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Loss on investment in COF2 increased $44,000 from $69,832 as originally
reported to $113,832 as restated. Net loss allocated to limited partners increased $44,000, from $394,034 as originally reported to $438,034 as
restated. Net loss per equivalent limited partners unit increase $0.03, from 0.26 as originally reported to $0.29 as restated.
Statement of Partners’ Capital for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Net loss allocated to limited partners increased$44,000, limited partners’
capital account and total capital decreased $44,000
Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 – Net loss increased $44,000 from $394,034 as originally reported to $438,034 as
restated. Loss on equity in COF2 investment increased $44,000 from $69,833 as originally reported to $113,833 as restated. Net cash used in
operating activities remained unchanged.
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates and those differences could be material. Such estimates relate primarily to the determination of residual
values at the end of the lease term, the expected future cash flows and fair value used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the
allowance for doubtful accounts.
F-9

Table of Contents
Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair Value Measurements
The Partnership applies the provisions included in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic to all financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. This Topic emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. It clarifies that fair value is an
exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Topic requires the use of valuation techniques to measure fair
value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:
· Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
· Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
· Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require internal development of assumptions about
how market participants price the asset or liability.
There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020. There were no assets measured on a
non-recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Fair Value disclosures of financial instruments
Estimated fair value was determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
judgment was necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Cash, other receivables, accounts payable and other accrued
expenses are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair values as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 due to the immediate or short-
term nature of these financial instruments.
The Partnership’s long-term debt consists of notes payable, which are secured by specific equipment and are nonrecourse liabilities of the
Partnership. The estimated fair value of this debt at December 31, 2021 and 2020 approximates the carrying value of these instruments, due to the
interest rates on this debt approximating current market interest rates. The Partnership classifies the fair value of its notes payable within Level 2
of the valuation hierarchy based on the observable inputs used to estimate fair value.
Revenue Recognition
The Partnership is principally engaged in business of leasing equipment. Ancillary to the Partnership’s principal equipment leasing business, the
Partnership also sells certain equipment and may offer certain services to support its customers.
The Partnership’s lease transactions are principally accounted for under Topic 842 on January 1, 2019. Prior to Topic 842, the Partnership
accounted for these transactions under Topic 840, Leases (“Topic 840”). Lease revenue includes revenue generated from leasing equipment to
customers, including re-rent revenue, and is recognized as either on a straight line basis or using the effective interest method over the length of
the lease contract, if such lease is either an operating lease or finance lease, respectively.
The Partnership’s sale of equipment along with certain services provided to customers is recognized under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, (“Topic 606”), which was adopted on January 1, 2018. Prior to adoption of Topic 606, the Partnership recognized these
transactions under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognized, and (“Topic 605”). The Partnership recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance
obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the
Partnership expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.
F-10

Table of Contents
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Partnership’s lease portfolio consisted of operating leases and finance leases. For operating
leases, lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement. Finance lease interest income is
recorded over the term of the lease using the effective interest method.
Upon the end of the lease term, if the lessee has not met the return conditions as set out in the lease, the Partnership is entitled in certain cases to
additional compensation from the lessee. The Partnership’s accounting policy for recording such payments is to treat them as revenue.
Gains or losses from sales of leased and off-lease equipment are recorded on a net basis in the Partnership’s Statement of Operations. Gains from
the termination of leases are recognized when the lease is modified and terminated concurrently. Our leases do not contain any step-rent provisions
or escalation clauses nor are lease revenues adjusted based on any index.
Partnership’s accounting policy for sales and property taxes collected from the lessees are recorded in the current period as gross revenues and
expenses.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This standard establishes an impairment model (known as the current expected credit
loss (“CECL”) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance
its estimate of expected credit losses, which is intended to result in a timelier recognition of losses. Under the CECL model, entities will estimate
credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications)
from the date of initial recognition of the financial instrument. Measurement of expected credit losses are to be based on relevant forecasts that
affect collectability. The scope of financial assets within the CECL methodology is broad and includes trade receivables from certain revenue
transactions and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. Different components of the guidance require modified retrospective or prospective
adoption.
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. ASU 2018-19
clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard. Instead, entities would need to apply
other U.S. GAAP, namely Topic 842 (Leases), to account for changes in the collectability assessment for operating leases. Other than operating
lease receivables, Partnership trade receivables include receivables from finance leases and equipment sales. Under Topic 606 (Revenue from
Contracts with Customers), revenue is recognized when, among other criteria, it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it
is entitled for goods or services transferred to a customer. At the point that finance lease receivables are recorded, they become subject to the
CECL model and estimates of expected credit losses over their contractual life will be required to be recorded at inception based on historical
information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Trade receivables derived from equipment sales are of short duration
and there is not a material difference between incurred losses and expected losses.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives
and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which amends and clarifies several provisions of Topic 326. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU
2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief, which amends Topic 326 to allow the fair value option to be
elected for certain financial instruments upon adoption. ASU 2019-10 extended the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for the Partnership until
December 15, 2022. While we continue to evaluate the new guidance, including the subsequent updates to Topic 326, we do not anticipate that
adoption will have a material impact on the Partnership financial statements and related disclosures. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, Partnership finance lease revenue subject to CECL represented less than 1% of total lease revenue.

Table of Contents
Equity Method Investment
The Partnership accounts for its investment in COF2 under the equity method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 323.
Under the equity method, the Partnership records its proportionate share of the Fund’s net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and
net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may
differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of distributions and allocation formulas, if any, as described in such
governing documents.
Other Assets
Equipment acquisition costs and deferred expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over two-to-four year lives based on the original term of
the lease and loan, respectively. Unamortized acquisition costs and deferred expenses are charged to amortization expense when the associated
leased equipment is sold.
Long-Lived Assets
Depreciation on technology and inventory management equipment for financial statement purposes is based on the straight-line method estimated
generally over useful lives of two to five years. Once an asset comes off lease or is released, the Partnership reassesses the useful life of an asset.
The Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may not be recoverable. The
Partnership determines whether impairment exists by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each asset. If the estimated
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset then impairment exists. The amount of the impairment is determined based on
the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by
the asset, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets, as applicable, based on asset type.
Residual values are determined by management and are calculated using information from both internal and external sources, as well as other
economic indicators.
Reimbursable Expenses
Reimbursable expenses are comprised of both ongoing operational expenses and fees associated with the allocation of salaries and benefits,
referred to as other LP expenses. Reimbursable expenses, which are charged to the Partnership by CCC in connection with the administration and
operation of the Partnership, are allocated to the Partnership based upon several factors including, but not limited to, the number of investors,
compliance issues, and the number of existing leases. For example, if a partnership has more investors than another program sponsored by CCC,
then higher amounts of expenses related to investor services, including mailing and printing costs will be allocated to that partnership. Also, while
a partnership is in its offering stage, higher compliance costs are allocated to it than to a program not in its offering stage, as compliance resources
are utilized to review incoming investor suitability and proper documentation. Finally, lease related expenses, such as due diligence,
correspondence, collection efforts and analysis and staff costs, increase as programs purchase more leases, and decrease as leases terminate and
equipment is sold. All of these factors contribute to CCC’s determination as to the amount of expenses to allocate to the Partnership or to other
sponsored programs. CCC is not reimbursed for salary and benefit costs of control persons. For the Partnership, all reimbursable items are
expensed as they are incurred.
Lease Income Receivable
Lease income receivable includes current lease income receivable net of allowances for uncollectible amounts, if any. The Partnership monitors
lease income receivable to ensure timely and accurate payment by lessees. The Partnership’s Lease Relations department is responsible for
monitoring lease income receivable and, as necessary, resolving outstanding invoices.
The Partnership reviews a customer’s credit history before extending credit. When the analysis indicates that the probability of full collection is
unlikely, the Partnership may establish an allowance for uncollectible lease income receivable based upon the credit risk of specific customers,
historical trends and other information. The Partnership writes off its lease income receivable when it determines that it is uncollectible and all
economically sensible means of recovery have been exhausted.

Cash and cash equivalents
We consider cash and cash equivalents to be cash on hand and highly liquid investments with the original maturity dates of 90 days or less.
At December 31, 2021, cash was held in one bank maintained at one financial institution with an aggregate balance of approximately $18,000. Bank
accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total cash bank balance was approximately as
follows:
Balance at December 31 2021 2020
Total bank balance $ 18,000 $ 501,000
FDIC insured (18,000) (250,000)
Uninsured amount $ - $ 251,000
The Partnership believes it mitigates the risk of holding uninsured deposits by only depositing funds with major financial institutions. The
Partnership has not experienced any losses in our accounts, and believes it is not exposed
to any significant credit risk. The amounts in such accounts will fluctuate throughout 2022 due to many factors, including the pace of cash receipts,
equipment acquisitions, interest rates and distributions to limited partners.
Income Taxes
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 701 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Partnership is not subject to federal or state income taxes. All income
and losses of the Partnership are the liability of the individual partners and are allocated to the partners for inclusion in their individual tax returns.
The Partnership does not have any entity-level uncertain tax positions. In addition, the Partnership believes its tax status as a pass-through entity
would be sustained under U.S. Federal, state or local tax examination. The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state income tax returns and is
generally subject to examination by federal, state and local income tax authorities for three years from the filing of a tax return.
Taxable income differs from financial statement net income as a result of reporting certain income and expense items for tax purposes in periods
other than those used for financial statement purposes, principally relating to depreciation, amortization, and lease revenue.
Net Loss Per Equivalent Limited Partnership Unit
The net loss per equivalent limited partnership unit is computed based upon net income (loss) allocated to the limited partners and the weighted
average number of equivalent units outstanding during the year.
4. Information Technology, Medical Technology, Telecommunications Technology, Inventory Management Equipment and Other
Business-Essential Capital Equipment (“equipment”)
The Partnership is the lessor of equipment under leases with periods that generally range from 12 to 48 months. In general, associated costs such
as repairs and maintenance, insurance and property taxes are paid by the lessee.
The Partnership’s share of the cost of the equipment in which it participates with other partnerships at December 31, 2021 was approximately
$6,229,000 and is included in the Partnership’s equipment on its balance sheet. The Partnership’s share of the outstanding debt associated with
this equipment at December 31, 2021 was approximately $76,000 and is included in the Partnership’s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
cost of the equipment shared by the Partnership with other partnerships at December 31, 2021 was approximately $14,952,000. The total
outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by the Partnership at December 31, 2021 was approximately $305,000.
F-13

Table of Contents
The Partnership’s share of the cost of the equipment in which it participates with other partnerships at December 31, 2020 was approximately
$10,226,000 and is included in the Partnership’s equipment on its balance sheet. The Partnership’s share of the outstanding debt associated with
this equipment at December 31, 2020 was approximately $380,000 and is included in the Partnership’s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
cost of the equipment shared by the Partnership with other partnerships at December 31, 2020 was approximately $23,869,000. The total
outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by the Partnership at December 31, 2020 was approximately $1,020,000.
As the Partnership and the other programs managed by the General Partner increase their overall portfolio size, opportunities for shared
participation are expected to continue. Sharing in the acquisition of a lease portfolio gives the fund an opportunity to acquire additional assets and
revenue streams, while allowing the fund to remain diversified and reducing its overall risk with respect to one portfolio. As additional investment
opportunities arise for 2022, the Partnership expects total shared equipment and related debt to trend higher as the Partnership builds its portfolio.
The following is a schedule of approximate future minimum rentals on operating leases:
Years Ended December 31, Amount
2022 $ 149,500
2023 43,000
2024 26,000
2025 3,500

Initial direct costs- finance leases - 1,000
Net investment in finance leases $ 35,000 $ 46,000
We assess credit risk for all of our customers, including those that lease under finance leases. This credit risk is assessed using an internally
developed model which incorporates credit scores from third party providers and our own customer risk ratings and is periodically reviewed. Our
internal ratings are weighted based on the industry that the customer operates in. Factors taken into consideration when assessing risk, includes
both general and industry specific qualitative and quantitative metrics. We separately take in to consideration payment history, open lawsuits, liens
and judgments. Typically, we will not extend credit to a company that has been in business for less than 5 years or that has filed for bankruptcy
within the same period. Our internally based model may classify a company as high risk based on our analysis of their audited financial statements
and their payment history. Additional considerations of high risk may include history of late payments, open lawsuits and liens or judgments. In an
effort to mitigate risk, we typically require deposits from those in this category.
A reserve for credit losses is deemed necessary when payment has not been received for one or more months of receivables due on the equipment
held under finance leases. At the end of each period, management evaluates the open receivables due on this equipment and determines the need
for a reserve based on payment history and any current factors that would have an impact on payments.

As of the year ended December 31, 2021 we determined that we did not have a need for an allowance for uncollectible accounts associated with
any of our finance leases, as the customer payment histories with us, associated with these leases, has been positive.
CCC, on behalf of the Partnership and on behalf of other affiliated companies and partnerships (“partnerships”), acquires equipment subject to
associated debt obligations and lease agreements and allocates a participation in the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various companies based
on certain risk factors.

6. Investment in COF 2
On August 13, 2015, the Partnership purchased 1,648 units for $1,500,000, of Commonwealth Opportunity Fund 2 (“COF 2”), an affiliate fund of
the General Partner. In accordance with the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is permitted to invest in equipment programs formed by the
General Partner or its affiliates. COF 2 is an affiliate program that broke escrow on August 13, 2015. The General Partner believes this action is in
the best interests of all the Programs. The Partnership accounts for its investment in COF 2 under the equity method in accordance with ASC 323.
The Partnership’s net investment in COF 2 at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $503,000 and $617,000, respectively (see COF 2
Financial Summary below). For the year ended December 31, 2021, COF 2 declared distributions to the Partnership of approximately $0 of which
approximately $0 was paid in 2021 and approximately $0 is recorded as a receivable from COF 2 at December 31, 2021.

The General Partner Equipment Acquisition Fee. The General Partner earned an $ 6,000 $ 18,000
equipment acquisition fee of 4% of the purchase price of each item of
equipment purchased as compensation for the negotiation of the
acquisition of the equipment and lease thereof or sale under a
conditional sales contract. At December 31, 2021, the prepaid
acquisition fees balance was $0. For the year ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, equipment acquisition fees earned by the General
Partner for operating and finance leases was approximately $6,000
and $18,000, respectively.
The General Partner Debt Placement Fee. As compensation for arranging term debt to $ - $ 2,000
finance our acquisition of equipment, we will pay the general partner
a fee equal to one percent of such indebtedness; provided, however,
that such fee shall be reduced to the extent we incur such fees to
third parties unaffiliated with the general partner or the lender with
respect to such indebtedness. No such fee will be paid with respect to
borrowings from the general partner or its affiliates. We intend to
initially acquire leases on an all cash basis with the proceeds of this
offering, but may borrow funds after the offering proceeds have been
invested. The amount we borrow, and therefore the amount of the fee,
will depend upon interest rates at the time of a loan, and the amount
of leverage we determine is appropriate at the time. We do not intend
to use more than 30% leverage overall in our portfolio. Fees will
increase as the amount of leverage we use increases, and as turnover
in the portfolio increases and additional equipment is purchased using
leverage.
The General Partner Equipment Management Fee. A monthly fee equal to the lesser of $ 62,000 $ 86,000
(a) the fees which would be charged by an independent third party in
the same geographic market for similar services and similar
equipment or (b) the sum of (i) two percent of the gross lease
revenues attributable to equipment subject to full payout net leases
which contain net lease provisions and (ii) five percent of the gross
lease revenues attributable to equipment subject to operating leases
and (iii) two percent of the gross lease revenues attributable to
equipment subject to finance leases.
The General Partner Equipment Liquidation Fee. With respect to each item of $ 10,000 $ 8,000
equipment sold by the general partner, a fee equal to the lesser of (i)
50% of the competitive equipment sale commission or (ii) three
percent of the sales price for such equipment. The payment of this fee
is subordinated to the receipt by the Limited Partners of (i) a return of
their capital contributions and 10% annum cumulative return,
compounded daily, on adjusted capital contributions and (ii) the net
disposition proceeds from such sale in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement. Such fee is reduced to the extent any
liquidation or resale fees are paid to unaffiliated parties.
The General Partner Partnership Interest and Distribution. The General Partner has a $ - $ -
present and continuing one percent interest of $1,000 in the
Partnership’s item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and tax
preference. In addition, the General Partner receives one percent of
cash available for distribution until the Limited Partners have received
distributions of cash available for Distribution equal to their capital
contributions plus the 10% cumulative return and thereafter, the
General Partner will receive 10% of cash available for distribution.

10. Commitments and Contingencies
FINRA
On May 3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a complaint naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp. (“CCSC”) and the owner
of the firm, Kimberly Springsteen-Abbott, as respondents; however, on October 22, 2013, FINRA filed an amended complaint that dropped the
allegations against CCSC and reduced the scope of the allegations against Ms. Springsteen-Abbott. The sole remaining charge was that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott had approved the misallocation of some expenses to certain Funds. Management believes that the expenses at issue include
amounts that were proper and that were properly allocated to Funds, and also identified a smaller number of expenses that had been allocated in
error, but were adjusted and repaid to the affected Funds when they were identified in 2012. During the period in question, Commonwealth
Capital Corp. (“CCC”) and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to the Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and
voluntarily waived fees in amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned allocations. A Hearing Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated approximately
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of three years. As such, management had already at that time reallocated back
approximately $151,225 of the $208,000 (in allegedly misallocated expenses) to the affected funds, which was fully documented, as good faith
payments for the benefit of those Income Funds.
The decision of the Hearing Panel was stayed when it was appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory Council (the “NAC”) pursuant to FINRA Rule
9311. The NAC issued a decision that upheld the lower panel’s ruling and the bar took effect on August 23, 2016. Ms. Springsteen-Abbott
appealed the NAC’s decision to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). On March 31, 2017, the SEC criticized that decision as
so flawed that the SEC could not even review it, and remanded the matter back to FINRA for further consideration consistent with the SEC’s
remand, but did not suggest any view as to a particular outcome.
On July 21, 2017, FINRA reduced the list of 1,840 items totaling $208,000 to a remaining list of 87 items totaling $36,226 (which includes
approximately $30,000 of continuing education expenses for personnel providing services to the Funds), and reduced the proposed fine from
$100,000 to $50,000, but reaffirmed its position on the bar from the securities industry. Respondents promptly appealed FINRA’s revised ruling to
the SEC. All the requested or allowed briefs have been filed with the SEC. Despite offering no additional evidence or legal reasoning from when
SEC originally remanded this matter (for FINRA’s opinion being an unreviewably flawed opinion), the SEC upheld FINRA’s new order on February
7, 2020 as to the bar; however, FINRA’s fine was voided. Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has filed a Petition for Review in the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review a final order entered against her by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On
February 26, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, made their ruling. They dismissed in part and denied in
part Ms. Springsteen-Abbott’s petition. This was regardless of CCC’s good faith reimbursements made many years ago of the questioned expense
items of $208,000 (due to improper documentation), initially claimed misallocations by FINRA, even prior to FINRA’s reducing its final claim to
$36,226.
F-19

Table of Contents
Prior to the original appeal to the SEC, Ms. Springsteen-Abbott discovered CCC’s required documentation of these items for FINRA review, which
FINRA refused to consider, despite such efforts the District Court upheld the bar, despite admittingly not addressing her “due process” rights, for
legal administrative procedural reasons. However, given the SEC’s prior removal of FINRA’s fine and the District Court upholding that removal,
the General Partner anticipates that this ruling will not result in any material financial impact to the Funds.
11. Reconciliation of Amounts Reported for Financial Reporting Purposes to Amounts on the Federal Partnership Return (Unaudited)
The tax basis of the Company’s net assets and liabilities vary from the amounts presented in these financial statements at December 31, 2021 and
2020 as follows:
Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020
(restated)
Tax basis of net assets (unaudited) $ 3,550,097 $ 2,863,609
Financial statement basis of net assets 1,769,412 2,264,129
Difference (unaudited) $ 1,780,685 $ 599,480
The primary differences between the tax basis of net assets and the amounts recorded in the financial statements are the result of differences in
accounting for impairment losses, syndication costs and differences between the depreciation methods used in the financial statements and the
Partnership’s tax returns (unaudited).
Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020
Net loss for financial reporting purposes to taxable gain $ (438,034) $ (509,638)
Gain on sale of equipment 153,620 80,088
Depreciation 723,577 602,262

Bad debt expense (23,362) 51,583
*Other 300,722 (79,349)
Taxable income on the Federal Partnership return (unaudited) $ 675,289 $ 230,156
*Other- includes financial statement adjustments that will be reflected on the tax return in the subsequent year.
12. COVID-19
COVID-19 Pandemic
The amount of revenue recognized and the pattern of revenue recognition may be impacted by COVID-19. In December 2019, a strain of
coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, and on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization
(“WHO”) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United
States, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, quarantines, and other public health safety measures. Such government-imposed
precautionary measures may have been relaxed in certain countries or states, but there is no assurance that more strict measures will be put in
place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. In addition, the COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases could result in a widespread
health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact the
Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pattern of revenue recognition may change for delays in rendering services.
F-20

Table of Contents
In periods ended subsequent to the outbreak of COVID-19, the impact on expected credit losses and future cash flow projections used in
impairment testing will need to be considered.
The Partnership continues to evaluate whether adjustments to the financial statements are required or whether additional disclosures are
necessary. In our leasing business, the Company is always subject to credit losses as it relates to a customer’s ability to make timely rental
payments. The impact of COVID-19 may contribute to risk of non-performance, where a customer may experience financial difficulty and may delay
in making timely payments.
The Partnership recognizes impairment of receivables and loans when losses are incurred, which is when it is probable that an entity will be unable
to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the arrangement. Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the receivable’s or loans effective interest rate, except that, as a practical expedient, impairment can be measured
based on a receivable’s or loans’ observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.
The Partnership believes its estimate of expected losses have been recognized based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable
forecasts. The impacts of COVID-19 may necessitate additional adjustments in future forecasts of expected losses.
Although the Partnership cannot estimate the length or gravity of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at this time, if the pandemic continues, it
may have a material adverse effect on the Partnership results of future operations, financial position, and liquidity in fiscal year 2021 and beyond.
