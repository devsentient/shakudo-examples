Additional Information
Brokerage and Related Services
MSCO offers a wide selection of quality investment services, including broker assisted trades and free online self-service features such as
real time quotes, market data, and trading tools.
Upon its merger with StockCross Financial Services, Inc., on January 1, 2020, MSCO became a self-clearing broker-dealer and added
business lines such as securities lending, equity stock plan services, and market making. MSCO also clears with National Financial Services Corp.
(“NFS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR, LLC.
Independent Retail Execution Services
MSCO and its clearing firms monitor order flow in efforts to ensure that customers are getting the best possible trade executions.
All equity orders are routed in a manner intended to afford MSCO’s customers the most favorable terms on all orders. Customers may buy
or sell fixed income securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, government sponsored enterprises, unit investment
trusts, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, and other securities. These transactions are serviced by MSCO’s registered representatives.
Retail Customer Service
MSCO believes that its superior customer service enhances its ability to compete with larger brokerage firms and provides retail customers
with personal service via access to dedicated customer service personnel for all of its products and services. Customer service personnel, located in
MSCO’s branch offices, are cross trained to assist with all clients’ needs for a reliable experience. MSCO uses a variety of customer relationship
management systems that enables representatives, in any location, to review and respond to customers’ requests in a timely manner.
Retirement Accounts
MSCO offers customers a variety of self-directed retirement accounts. Each IRA, SEP IRA, ROTH IRA, and KEOGH account can be invested
in a variety of qualified investments in a consolidated account. MSCO acts as its own custodian for retirement accounts and also utilizes NFS for
IRA custody. MSCO offers self-directed retirement accounts and also has registered representatives dedicated to assisting clients in meeting their
retirement goals.
Customer Financing
Customer margin accounts are carried whereby money is lent to customers for a portion of the market value of marginable securities held in
the customer’s account. Margin loans are collateralized by these securities. Customers also may sell securities short in a margin account, subject to
minimum equity and applicable margin requirements, and the availability of such securities to be borrowed. In permitting customers to engage in
margin financing, short sale or any other transaction, MSCO assumes the risk of its customers’ failure to meet their obligations in the event of
adverse changes in the market affect the value of the margined securities positions. MSCO and NFS reserve the right to set margin requirements
higher than those established by the Federal Reserve System.
MSCO has established policies with respect to maximum purchase commitments for new customers or customers with inadequate collateral
to support a requested purchase. When transactions occur outside normal guidelines, MSCO monitors accounts closely until their payment
obligations are completed. If the customer does not meet the required commitments, MSCO takes steps to close out the position and minimize any
loss. In the last five years, MSCO has not had any significant losses as a result of customers failing to meet commitments.
Siebert AdvisorNXT, Inc.
Overview
SNXT offers customers our proprietary robo-advisory technology that utilizes trading algorithms initially developed by STCH. This
technology provides clients with cost-efficient, competitively priced, and automated wealth management solutions intended to maximize portfolio
returns based on specific risk tolerance. The platform utilizes Nobel Prize-winning Modern Portfolio Theory (“MPT”) to create optimal portfolios for
each client. We provide web-based tools to enable clients to monitor and interact with the Robo-Advisor’s automated portfolio manager application.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 3

The Robo-Advisor selects low-cost, well-managed, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”) that represent the
asset classes that provide clients the necessary risk-adjusted exposure given current market conditions. In order to determine a client’s risk
tolerance, a prospective client answers a series of objective questions posed in the form of an interactive digital interview. Once a client’s risk
tolerance is determined, the Robo-Advisor’s algorithm utilizes MPT to create a theoretically optimal allocation across a diverse selection of asset
classes, thus tailoring a portfolio to a client’s specific investment objectives and risk tolerance. The Robo-Advisor continuously monitors and
periodically rebalances portfolios to address changes in market and economic conditions.
SNXT offers its clients access to investment managers and advisory services of Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (“Envestnet”). Envestnet
is registered with the SEC as an investment advisor and provides investment advisory services, technology services, and products to our advisory

In January 2022, we acquired a minority stake in Hedge Connection, Inc. (“Hedge Connection”), a woman-owned FinTech company offering
a patented enterprise capital introduction SaaS solution, branded as “FUEL.” The founder of Hedge Connection, Lisa Vioni, was appointed as
President of RISE Prime – Head of Capital Introductions, and was appointed to the Board of RISE.

Partners”), a disabled and woman-owned financial services firm, in exchange for a minority stake in RISE and shares of Siebert stock.
Tigress Financial Partners provides institutional and high net worth investors with expertise in investment banking, capital markets,

This partnership aligns two key broker-dealers on Wall Street with a shared culture, and the transaction’s focus on ESG and charitable

StockCross Financial Services, Inc.
Effective January 1, 2020, we acquired the remaining 85% of StockCross’ outstanding shares, and StockCross was merged with and into
MSCO. As of January 1, 2020, all clearing services provided by StockCross were performed by MSCO.
The acquisition of StockCross provided new business lines such as market-making, equity stock plan services, self-clearing and custody, IRA
custodianship and securities lending. Merging StockCross into MSCO increased our total net capital and assets under management and added two
retail branches. StockCross also provided an equity stock plan service business line that offers integrated and comprehensive solutions to corporate
service clients and employee participants.
Competition
We encounter significant competition from full-commission, online and discount brokerage firms, including zero commission firms, as well
as from financial institutions, mutual fund sponsors, venture-backed technology and cryptocurrency firms, and other organizations. Although there
has been consolidation in the industry in both the online and traditional brokerage business during recent years, we believe that additional
competitors such as banks, insurance companies, providers of online financial and information services, and others will continue to be attracted to
the brokerage industry. We compete with a wide variety of vendors of financial services for the same customers; however, our success in the
financial services industry is a result of our high-quality customer service, responsiveness, products offered, and excellent executions.

Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity presents significant challenges to the business community in general, as well as to the financial services industry.
Increasingly, bad actors, both domestically and internationally, attempt to steal personal data and/or interrupt the normal functioning of businesses
through accessing individuals’ and companies’ files and equipment connected to the Internet. Recently, intruders have become increasingly
sophisticated and use deceptive methods to steal funds and personally identifiable information which they either take for their own purposes,
release to the Internet, or hold for ransom. Regulators are increasingly requiring companies to provide more advanced levels of cybersecurity
measures. We continue to maintain systems and ongoing planning measures to prevent any such attack from disrupting our services to clients as
well as to prevent any loss of data concerning our clients, their financial affairs, and company-privileged information. We contract cybersecurity
consultants as well as other vendors to oversee detection and defense from such attacks. Refer to Item 1A. – Risk Factors for more detail.
Regulations
Overview
The securities industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. The SEC is the federal agency
charged with administration of the federal securities laws. MSCO and RISE are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC. MSCO is a member of
the NYSE and the FINRA. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), principally
FINRA, which is MSCO’s and RISE’s primary regulator with respect to financial and operational compliance. These SROs adopt rules (subject to
approval by the SEC) governing the industry and conduct periodic examinations of broker-dealers. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by
state securities authorities in the states in which they do business. MSCO is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and
Puerto Rico, and RISE is registered as a broker-dealer in 22 states and territories. These regulations affect our business operations and impose
capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements.
Conduct and Training
The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets. The
regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including training of personnel, sales methods, trading
practices among broker-dealers, uses and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, record keeping, fee
arrangements, disclosure to clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by
the SEC and by SROs or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and
profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC, SROs and state securities authorities may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censure,
fine, cease and desist orders or suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or its employees.
Dodd-Frank Act of 2010
As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), the adoption of
implementing regulations by the federal regulatory agencies as well as other recent regulatory reforms, we have experienced significant changes in
the laws and regulations that apply to us, how we are regulated, and regulatory expectations in the areas of compliance, risk management,
corporate governance, operations, capital and liquidity.
Regulation Best Interest
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care
similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to RIAs. In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the
provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers, including Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS. Among other things, Regulation
Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any
securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. Form CRS requires that broker-dealers and investment advisers provide retail
investors with a brief summary document containing simple, easy-to-understand information about the nature of the relationship between the
parties. Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS had a compliance date of June 30, 2020.
Regulation Best Interest Rules have impacted the conduct of our business, especially with respect to our business with our retail clients. The
need for enhanced documentation for recommendations of securities transactions to broker-dealer retail clients as well as the increased
supervision of sales practices and transactions have increased the amount of record-keeping and training for our sales staff. The related new rules
and procedures have and may continue to bring increased costs associated with compliance and enhanced technology.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 6

We reviewed our business practices and operating models in light of the Regulation Best Interest Rules and made structural, technological
and operational changes to our business leading up to the effective date of June 30, 2020 for compliance with the Regulation Best Interest Rules. As
a result, we conducted thorough training of all our employees with respect to the requirements of Regulation Best Interest. Additionally, we created
the Regulation Best Interest Rule’s required documents and completed each of the required mailings (both electronic and conventional) prior to the
effective date. We believe that the changes made to our business processes resulted in compliance with these new requirements. As business
continues to be conducted under the Regulation Best Interest Rules, it is likely that additional changes may be necessary.
SIPC
As a registered broker-dealer and FINRA member organization, MSCO is required by federal law to belong to the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) which provides, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, protection for securities held in customer
accounts held by the firm of up to $500,000 per customer, subject to a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances. SIPC is principally
funded through assessments on registered broker-dealers. MSCO purchased $50 million additional account protection above SIPC coverage.
Equities, bonds, mutual funds and money market funds are included at net asset value for purposes of SIPC protection and the additional
protection. Neither SIPC protection nor the additional protection insures against fluctuations in the market value of securities.
MSRB
MSCO is also authorized by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) to affect transactions in municipal securities on behalf of
its customers and has obtained certain additional registrations with the SEC and state regulatory agencies necessary to permit it to engage in
certain other activities incidental to its brokerage business.
Margin Lending
Margin lending activities are subject to limitations imposed by regulations of the Federal Reserve System and FINRA. In general, these
regulations provide that, in the event of a significant decline in the value of securities collateralizing a margin account, we are required to obtain
additional collateral from the borrower or liquidate securities positions. Margin lending arranged by MSCO through third parties is subject to the
margin rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the NYSE. Under such rules, broker-dealers are limited in the amount
they may lend in connection with certain purchases and short sales of securities and are also required to impose certain maintenance requirements
on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, those rules and rules of the Chicago Board Options Exchange govern the
amount of margin customers must provide and maintain in writing uncovered options.
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
SNXT is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser pursuant to the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act, together with the SEC’s
regulations and interpretations thereunder, is a highly prescriptive regulatory statute. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose
sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration and, in the case of willful
violations, can refer a matter to the Unites States Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
Under the Advisers Act, an investment adviser (whether or not registered under the Advisers Act) owes fiduciary duties to its clients. These
duties impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things, trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of
investment opportunities among clients; use of “soft dollar arrangements,” a practice that involves using client brokerage commissions to purchase
research or other services that help managers make investment decisions; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients.
As a RIA, SNXT is subject to additional requirements that cover, among other things, disclosure of information about its business to clients;
maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees SNXT may charge;
custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has legal authority to inspect any investment adviser and
typically inspects a RIA periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities in compliance with (i) applicable laws and
regulations, (ii) disclosures made to clients and (iii) adequate systems, policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent and detect
violations.
Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act provides a “safe harbor” to investment managers who use commission dollars generated by their advised
accounts to obtain investment research and brokerage services that provide lawful and appropriate assistance to the manager in the performance
of investment decision-making responsibilities. SNXT, as a matter of policy, does not use “soft dollars” and as such, it has no incentive to select or
recommend a broker or dealer based on any interest in receiving research or related services. Rather, as a fiduciary, SNXT selects brokers based
on its clients’ interests in receiving best execution.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 7

Bank Secrecy Act of 1970
We conduct financial services activities that are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 (“PATRIOT Act”), which require financial institutions to develop and implement programs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
these regulations. The BSA and PATRIOT Act include a variety of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements (such as currency
transaction reporting and suspicious activity reporting) as well as identity verification and client due diligence requirements, which are intended to
detect, report and/or prevent money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. In addition, we are subject to U.S. sanctions programs
administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Net Capital
As registered broker-dealers, MSCO and RISE are subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act relating to broker-dealers such as
minimum net capital requirements under the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), “best execution” requirements for client trades under
SEC guidelines and FINRA rules, and segregation of fully paid client funds and securities under the SEC Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3),
administered by the SEC and FINRA.
Net capital rules are designed to protect clients, counterparties and creditors by requiring a broker-dealer to have sufficient liquid
resources available to satisfy its financial obligations. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer’s readily available liquid assets, reduced by its
total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt. Under the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule, a broker-dealer may not repay any subordinated
borrowings, pay cash dividends or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net
capital amount below required levels. Failure to maintain the required regulatory net capital may subject a firm to suspension or expulsion by the
NYSE or FINRA, as well as certain punitive actions by the SEC and other regulatory bodies, which ultimately could require a firm’s liquidation.
Best Execution
As explained in SEC guidelines and FINRA rules, brokers are required to seek the “best execution” reasonably available for their clients’
orders. In part, this requires brokers to use reasonable diligence so that the price to the client is as favorable as possible under prevailing market
conditions. MSCO and RISE send client orders to a number of market centers, including market makers and exchanges, which encourages
competition and ensures redundancy. For non-directed client orders, it is our policy to route orders to market centers based on a number of factors
that are more fully discussed in the Supplemental Materials of FINRA Rule 5310, including, where applicable, but not necessarily limited to, speed
of execution, price improvement opportunities, differences in price dis-improvement, likelihood of executions, the marketability of the order, size
guarantees, service levels and support, the reliability of order handling systems, client needs and expectations, transaction costs, and whether the
firm will receive remuneration for routing order flow to such market centers. Price improvement is available under certain market conditions and
for certain order types and we regularly monitor executions to ensure best execution standards are met.
Consumer Financial Information Privacy
In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive and confidential client data, including personal data. As a result, we
are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of
personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict.
To the extent they are applicable to us, we must comply with federal and state information-related laws and regulations in the United States,
including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, SEC Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, and Regulation S-ID, as
well as the California Consumer Protection Act and further potential federal and state requirements.
Human Capital
Our success depends on our ability to attract, hire, retain and develop highly skilled professionals in a variety of specialties, including
finance, technology, compliance, business development, cybersecurity and management. Due to the complexity of our business, we compete for
talent with other companies, both inside and outside of our industry, and in multiple geographical areas in the U.S.
Our human capital efforts focus on establishing a culture of service that emphasizes taking care of our employees, so they can take care of
our clients. To that end, we seek employees who are approachable, proactive, collaborative, agile and innovative, and who share our commitment to
excellence, integrity, and service. As of March 14, 2022, we had 125 employees, one of whom was a corporate officer. None of our employees are
represented by a union, and we believe that relations with our employees are good.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 8

To maintain a high-caliber, values-driven workforce that is committed to our culture, we strive to offer total rewards, including
compensation and benefits that position our company as an employer of choice. We design our compensation to be competitive in the markets in
which we compete, and closely monitor industry trends and practices to ensure we are able to attract and retain the personnel who are critical to
our success. To support our employees’ health and well-being, we offer competitive medical, dental and vision plans as well as other health
benefits.
We believe in our employees’ potential and provide training and development opportunities intended to maximize their performance and
professional growth. We require all of our employees to complete courses in key regulatory areas, such as insider trading and anti-money
laundering compliance.
We aim to provide a safe, inclusive environment for our employees, where they feel engaged in our business, supported in who they are and
empowered to succeed. We are committed to providing a workplace that is free from violence, harassment and other unsafe or disruptive
conditions, and require our personnel to attend regular training sessions and workshops on those topics.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and for the protection of our employees, clients and business partners, we implemented remote work
arrangements for nearly 100% of our employees, restricted business travel and temporarily closed some of our branch offices. As of the date of this
Report we have reopened all of our branch offices.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Regulatory Risks
Legislation has and may continue to result in changes to rules and regulations applicable to our business, which may negatively
impact our business and financial results.
New laws, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and self-
regulatory organization ("SRO") laws, rules, regulations and guidance may directly affect our business and the profitability of Siebert or the
operation of specific business lines. In addition, new and changing laws, rules, regulation and guidance could result in limitations on the lines of
business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements or other costs and could limit our
ability to return capital to stockholders.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), enacted in 2010, required many federal agencies
to adopt new rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry and called for many studies regarding various industry practices. In
particular, the Dodd-Frank Act gave the SEC discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment
advice to retail customers.
The rules and interpretations adopted by the SEC in June 2019 include Regulation Best Interest and the new Form CRS Relationship
Summary, which are intended to enhance the quality and transparency of retail investors' relationships with broker-dealers and investment
advisers. Regulation Best Interest enhances the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond existing suitability obligations, requiring compliance
with disclosure, care, conflict of interest and compliance obligations. The regulation requires that a broker-dealer or natural person who is an
associated person of the broker-dealer shall act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time it makes a recommendation of any securities
transaction or investment strategy involving securities, prioritizing the interests of the customer above any interests of the broker-dealer or its
associated persons. Among other things, this requires the broker-dealer to mitigate conflicts of interest arising from financial incentives in selling
securities products.
The new rules and processes related thereto have and will most likely continue to involve increased costs, including, but not limited to,
compliance costs associated with new or enhanced technology. In addition to the foregoing laws affecting regulation of our industry, Congress is
considering various proposals to increase taxation relating to investments, which may adversely impact the volume of trading and other
transactions from which we derive our revenue.
It is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be imposed, or whether any
existing proposals will become law. Conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect
the manner in which we conduct business.
We are subject to extensive government regulation and to third party litigation risk and regulatory risk which could result in
significant liabilities and reputational harm which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., at both the federal and state level. We are also subject to regulation by SROs and
other regulatory bodies in the U.S., such as the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA, MSRB, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the
National Futures Association (“NFA”). MSCO is registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and RISE is
registered as a broker-dealer in 22 states and territories. The regulations to which MSCO and RISE are subject as broker-dealers cover all aspects
of the securities business including training of personnel, sales methods, trading practices, uses and safe keeping of customers’ funds and
securities, capital structure, record keeping, fee arrangements, disclosure and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
SNXT is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act, and its business is highly regulated. The Advisers Act
imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. Moreover, the Advisers Act
grants broad administrative powers to regulatory agencies such as the SEC to regulate investment advisory businesses. If the SEC or other
government agencies believe that SNXT has failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, these agencies have the power to impose fines,
suspensions of a registrant and individual employees or other sanctions, which could include revocation of SNXT’s registration under the Advisers
Act. SNXT is also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA, to the extent that SNXT acts as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to
certain of its clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under
ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries
(and certain other related parties) to such plans. Our subsidiaries, RISE and MSCO, are also regulated by the National Futures Association (“NFA”)
and function as a registered introducing broker.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 10

The laws, rules and regulations, as well as governmental policies and accounting principles, governing our business and the financial
services and banking industries generally have changed significantly over recent years and are expected to continue to do so. We cannot predict
which changes in laws, rules, regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles will be adopted. Any changes in the laws, rules,
regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles relating to our business could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Additionally, like other participants in the financial services industry, we and our subsidiaries face the risks of lawsuits by clients and risks
of regulatory proceeding against us. The outcome of regulatory proceedings and client lawsuits is uncertain and difficult to predict. An adverse
resolution of any regulatory proceeding or client lawsuit against us could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to us. Further, adverse
proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain key registered representatives, investment advisers and wealth managers, and to
retain existing clients or attract new clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. Refer to Item 3 – Legal Proceedings for additional detail.
We are subject to net capital requirements.
The SEC, FINRA, and various other securities and commodities exchanges and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. have rules with respect to
net capital requirements which affect us. These rules have the effect of requiring that at least a substantial portion of a broker-dealer’s assets be
kept in cash or highly liquid investments. Our compliance with the net capital requirements could limit operations that require intensive use of
capital, such as underwriting or trading activities. These rules could also restrict our ability to withdraw our capital, even in circumstances where
we have more than the minimum amount of required capital, which, in turn, could limit our ability to implement growth strategies. In addition, a
change in such rules, or the imposition of new rules, affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of such net capital requirements, or a
significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital, could have similar adverse effects.
Risks Related to Our Technology and Information Systems
We rely on information processing and communications systems to process and record our transactions.
Our operations rely heavily on information processing and communications systems. Our system for processing securities transactions is
highly automated. Failure of our information processing or communications systems for a significant period of time could limit our ability to process
a large volume of transactions accurately and rapidly. This could cause us to be unable to satisfy our obligations to customers and other securities
firms and could result in regulatory violations. External events, such as an earthquake, terrorist attack or power failure, loss of external information
feeds, such as security price information, as well as internal malfunctions such as those that could occur during the implementation of system
modifications, could render part or all of these systems inoperative.
We rely on third-party platforms for information and communications systems.
We rely heavily on our data technology platforms and the platforms provided by our clearing agents. These platforms offer interfaces to our
clearing service providers’ computing systems where customer account records are kept and are accessible through our data technology platforms.
Our systems also utilize browser-based access and other types of data communications.
Our data technology platforms offers services used in direct relation to customer activities as well as support for corporate use. Some of
these services include email and messaging, market data systems and third-party trading systems, business productivity tools and customer
relationship management systems. Our data network is designed with redundancies in case a significant business disruption occurs.
We also rely on third parties that provide data center facilities, infrastructure, back-office systems for clearance, settlement and accounting,
customer relationship management, compliance and risk software and systems, website functionality and access, databases, data center facilities
and cloud computing, all of which are critical to our operations. To ensure reliability and to conform to regulatory requirements related to business
continuity, we maintain backup systems and backup data, leverage cloud-based technology, and have a full-time offsite disaster recovery site to
ensure business continuity during a potential wide-spread disruption. However, despite the preventive and protective measures in place, in the
event of a wide-spread disruption of our systems or those of the third-parties upon whom we rely, our ability to satisfy the obligations to customers
and other securities firms may be significantly hampered or completely disrupted.
Failure to protect client data or prevent breaches of our information systems could expose us to liability or reputational damage.
We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to
communicate among our branch offices and with our clients and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow,
the potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks increases. As a financial services company, we are continuously subject to cyber-attacks by
third parties. Any such security breach could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information. In addition, vulnerabilities of our external service providers and other third parties could pose security risks to client information. The
secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is also a critical element of our operations.
In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive and confidential client data, including personal data. As a result, we
are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of
personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict.
If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client data,
or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines
and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data, whether through systems
failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. Similarly, unauthorized access
to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyber-attack by third parties who may deploy viruses,
worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, and damage to our
reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type
or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 11

We may be exposed to damage to our business or our reputation by cybersecurity breaches.
As the world becomes more interconnected through the use of the Internet and users rely more extensively on the Internet and the cloud for
the transmission and storage of data, such information becomes more susceptible to incursion by hackers and other parties intent on stealing or
destroying data on which we or our customers rely. We face an evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats in which hackers use a complex array of
means to perpetrate cyber-attacks, including the use of stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, structured query language
injection attacks, and distributed denial-of-service attacks, among other means. These cybersecurity incidents have increased in number and
severity and it is expected that these trends will continue. Should we be affected by such an incident, we may incur substantial costs and suffer
other negative consequences, which may include:
• Remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business
partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack;
• Increased cybersecurity protection costs, which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and
protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants;
• Lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an
attack;
• Litigation and legal risks, including regulatory actions by state and federal regulators; and
• Loss of reputation.
Increasingly, intruders attempt to steal significant amounts of data, including personally identifiable data and either hold such data for
ransom or release it onto the Internet, exposing our clients to financial or other harm and thereby significantly increasing our liability in such
cases. Our regulators have introduced programs to review our protections against such incidents which, if they determined that our systems do not
reasonably protect our clients’ assets and their data, could result in enforcement activity and sanctions.
We have and continue to introduce systems and software to prevent any such incidents and review and increase our defenses to such issues
through the use of various services, programs and outside vendors. We contract cybersecurity consultants and also review and revise our
cybersecurity policy to ensure that it remains up to date. In the event that we experience a material cybersecurity incident or identify a material
cybersecurity threat, we will make all reasonable efforts to properly disclose it in a timely fashion. It is impossible, however, for us to know when or
if such incidents may arise or the business impact of any such incident.
As a result of such risks, we have and are likely to incur significant costs in preparing our infrastructure and maintaining it to resist any
such attacks.
An increase in volume on our systems or other events could cause them to malfunction.
Most of our trade orders are received and processed electronically. This method of trading is heavily dependent on the integrity of the
electronic systems supporting it. While we have never experienced a significant failure of our trading systems, heavy stress placed on our systems
during peak trading times could cause our systems to operate at unacceptably low speeds or fail altogether. Any significant degradation or failure
of our systems or the systems of third parties involved in the trading process (e.g., online and Internet service providers, record keeping and data
processing functions performed by third parties, and third party software), even for a short time, could cause customers to suffer delays in trading.
These delays could cause substantial losses for customers and could subject us to claims from these customers for losses. There can be no
assurance that our network structure will operate appropriately in the event of a subsystem, component or software failure. In addition, we cannot
assure that we will be able to prevent an extended systems failure in the event of a power or telecommunications failure, an earthquake, terrorist
attack, fire or any act of God. Any systems failure that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating results.
Rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and
services to our clients.
We must continue to enhance and improve our technology and electronic services. The electronic financial services industry is characterized
by significant structural changes, increasingly complex systems and infrastructures, changes in clients’ needs and preferences, and new business
models. If new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us, our existing technology, systems
and electronic trading services may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 12

Our future success will depend on our ability to:
• Enhance our existing products and services;
• Develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our clients and
prospective clients;
• Continue to attract highly-skilled technology personnel; and
• Respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.
Developing our electronic services, our implementation and utilization of our Robo-Advisor and other technology entails significant technical
and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform, information databases and
network infrastructure to client requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new services, products and
enhancements, our clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors.
Further, the adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to
modify and adapt our services. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary
technology and transaction-processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards. We cannot assure that we will be able to
respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements.
Risks Related to Our Business Operations
Potential strategic acquisitions and other business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.
Acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our business. We may pursue acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Acquisitions
and other transactions entail numerous risks, including:
• Difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, services and products;
• Failure to achieve expected synergies;
• Diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;
• Assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies;
• Amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings;
• Potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies; and
• Dilution to existing stockholders.
As part of our growth strategy, we regularly consider and from time to time engage in discussions and negotiations regarding transactions
such as acquisitions, mergers, combinations and partnerships within our industry. The purchase price for possible acquisitions could be paid in
cash, through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities, borrowings or a combination of these methods.
Our transactions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in
the business, operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to
buy or sell an entity or part of an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all. If a material transaction
does not close our stock price could decline.
We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions, and no assurance can be given
with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently
decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. However, opportunities may arise that we will evaluate and any transactions that we
consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us. These risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be
realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of our cost cutting efforts or it may take longer than anticipated for us to realize
any benefits from increased cost efficiencies or economies of scale, if at all.
Our realization of the benefits anticipated as a result of cost cutting efforts and other business efforts and changes will depend in part on
the ability of our management team to implement our business plan. We cannot assure shareholders that there will not be substantial costs
associated with these activities or other negative consequences as a result of these changes. These effects include, but are not limited to, incurring
unexpected costs or delays in connection with implementation of a modified business model, or the failure of our business to perform as expected,
which could harm our results of operations.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 13

We depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.
We are dependent upon our key personnel for our success and the loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly harm
our business, financial condition and operating results.
Our customers may fail to pay us.
A principal credit risk to which we are exposed on a regular basis is that our customers may fail to pay for their purchases or fail to maintain
the minimum required collateral for amounts borrowed against securities positions maintained by them. We cannot assure that our practices and/or
the policies and procedures we have established will be adequate to prevent a significant credit loss.
Our advisory services subject us to additional risks.
We provide investment advisory services to investors. Through our RIA, SNXT, we offer robo-advisory and investment services. The risks
associated with these investment advisory activities include those arising from possible conflicts of interest, unsuitable investment
recommendations, inadequate due diligence, inadequate disclosure and fraud. Realization of these risks could lead to liability for client losses,
regulatory fines, civil penalties and harm to our reputation and business.
Certain employees, directors and affiliates of RISE and Siebert own equity in RISE Financial Services, LLC
From January 31, 2022 to the date of this Report, RISE issued and Siebert sold membership interests in RISE to certain employees,
directors, and affiliates of RISE and Siebert ranging from 1% to 2% individually. This amount represented, as of the date of this Report, an
aggregate of 7% of the total issued and outstanding membership interests in RISE. As of the date of this Report, Tigress owns approximately 22%
of RISE. Cynthia DiBartolo is the founder and majority owner of Tigress, as well as the Chief Executive Officer of RISE and a director of Siebert. As
a result, the interests of the employees, directors, and affiliates of RISE and Siebert who own equity in RISE may differ from the interests of
shareholders of Siebert.
Risks Related to COVID-19
The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of
operations.
The COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the U.S. If COVID-19, or
another highly infectious or contagious disease, continues to spread or the response to contain it is unsuccessful, we could experience material
adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The extent of such effects will depend on future
developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the geographic spread of the virus, the overall severity of the disease,
the duration of the outbreak, the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as quarantines
and travel restrictions) and the possible further impacts on the global economy. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the
availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business.
Certain actions taken by U.S. or other governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, to reduce interest rates may
adversely affect our results of operations.
During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate twice for a total of 150 basis points to near
zero. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our revenue from interest, marketing and distribution fees.
Investor behavior may fundamentally change as a result of COVID-19 in both the near and long term which could have an adverse
effect on our operations.
We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its
impact. As such, impacts of COVID-19 to our business are highly uncertain and we will continue to assess the impact as the situation develops. The
disruptions to the U.S. and global economies and financial markets may cause investors to be more cautious and to limit their investments. Trading
of securities may be materially and adversely affected with more investors seeking stability. Investment activity may also be negatively impacted by
general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of job losses and any recession, resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic. Clients holding savings with us in retirement or investment accounts may be required to liquidate some or all of their savings to pay
living expenses. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our revenue streams.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 14

Risks Related to Our Common Stock
There may be a limited public market for our Common Stock; Volatility.
11,635,458 shares of Common Stock, or approximately 36% of our shares of Common Stock outstanding, are currently held by non-affiliates
as of March 14, 2022. A stock with a small number of shares held by non-affiliates, known as the “float,” will generally be more volatile than a stock
with a large float. Although our Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active public market will
continue.
Our principal shareholder has the ability to control key decisions submitted to a vote of our shareholders.
Gloria E. Gebbia, who is a director of Siebert and the managing member of Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, LLC (“KCA”), has, along with other
family members, the power to elect the entire Board of Directors and, except as otherwise provided by law or our Certificate of Incorporation or by-
laws, to approve any action requiring shareholder approval without a shareholders meeting.
Future sales of our Common Stock in the public market could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly,
even if our business is doing well.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a
large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock and make it more difficult for investors to sell
Common Stock at a time and price that investors deem appropriate.
In addition, on February 18, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective on March 2, 2022 by the
SEC for the potential offering, issuance and sale by us of up to $100.0 million, subject to certain limitations, of our Common Stock, preferred stock,
warrants to purchase our Common Stock and/or preferred stock, units consisting of all or some of these securities and subscription rights to
purchase all or some of these securities. If we sell our Common Stock, preferred stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in other
transactions pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, existing investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent sales, new
investors could gain rights superior to our existing shareholders and the market price of our Common Stock may drop significantly.
The price of our Common Stock in the public markets has experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme volatility due to a
variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Since our Common Stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock has been relatively thinly traded and at times
been subject to price volatility. From January 1, 2021 to January 28, 2021, the average close price of our Common Stock was $3.94 per share. On
January 29, 2021, the price increased to a high of $18.50 per share and approximately 34 million shares were traded. From February 1, 2021 to
February 28, 2021, the average close price was $5.60 per share. The average daily trading volume from March 1, 2021 to March 1, 2022 was
approximately 271,000 shares.
We believe that the trading price of our Common Stock has at times been influenced by trading factors other than industry or Company-
specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other
social media sites), speculation in the press, in the investment community, or on the internet, including on online forums and social media, about
Siebert, our industry or our security’s access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Common Stock, and the amount and
status of short interest in our securities (including a “short squeeze”). A “short squeeze” is a technical market condition that occurs when the price
of a stock increases substantially, forcing market participants who had taken a position that its price would fall (i.e., who had sold the stock
“short”), to buy it, which in turn may create significant, short-term demand for the stock not for fundamental reasons, but rather due to the need
for such market participants to acquire the stock in order to forestall the risk of even greater losses. A “short squeeze” condition in the market for a
stock can lead to short-term conditions involving very high volatility and trading that may or may not track fundamental valuation models.
As a result of the foregoing, investors in our Common Stock may be subject to the risk of significant, short-term price volatility of our
Common Stock and the trading price of our Common Stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of
operations. Further, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities,
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to
fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 15

Our future ability to pay dividends to holders of our Common Stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be
limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows.
Payment of future cash dividends on our Common Stock will depend on our ability to generate earnings and cash flows. However, sufficient
cash may not be available to pay such dividends. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will
depend upon a number of factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant, including future earnings, the success of our business activities,
capital requirements, the general financial condition and future prospects of our business and general business conditions. If we are unable to
generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business, we may not be able to pay dividends on our Common Stock.
Our ability to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock is also dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or capital
distributions to Siebert. MSCO and RISE are subject to various regulatory requirements relating to liquidity, capital standards and the use of client
funds and securities, which may limit funds available for payments to Siebert. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or capital
distributions to Siebert may also be subject to regulatory approval.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Market
Securities market volatility and other securities industry risk could adversely affect our business.
Most of our revenues are derived from our securities brokerage business. Like other businesses operating in the securities industry, our
business is directly affected by volatile trading markets, fluctuations in the volume of market activity, economic and political conditions, upward
and downward trends in business and finance at large, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial
communities, currency values, inflation, market conditions, the availability and cost of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit
capacity or perceived credit-worthiness of the securities industry in the marketplace and the level and volatility of interest rates. We also face risks
relating to losses resulting from the ownership of securities, counterparty failure to meet commitments, customer fraud, employee fraud, issuer
fraud, errors and misconduct, failures in connection with the processing of securities transactions and litigation. A reduction in our revenues or a
loss resulting from our ownership of securities or sales or trading of securities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of these risks, our revenues and operating results may be subject to significant
fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
A prolonged economic slowdown, volatility in the markets, a recession, and uncertainty in the markets could impair our business and
harm our operating results.
Our businesses are, and will continue to be, susceptible to economic slowdowns, recessions and volatility in the markets, which may lead to
financial losses for our customers, and a decrease in revenues and operating results. In addition, global macroeconomic conditions and U.S.
financial markets remain vulnerable to the potential risks posed by exogenous shocks, which could include, among other things, political and
financial uncertainty in the U.S. and the European Union, renewed concern about China’s economy, conflict with Russia and Ukraine, complications
involving terrorism and armed conflicts around the world, or other challenges to global trade or travel, such as might occur in the event of a wider
pandemic involving COVID-19. More generally, because our business is closely correlated to the macroeconomic outlook, a significant deterioration
in that outlook or an exogenous shock would likely have an immediate negative impact on our overall results of operations.
There is intense competition in the brokerage industry.
We encounter significant competition from full-commission, no commission, online and other discount brokerage firms, as well as from
financial institutions, mutual fund sponsors, venture-backed technology and cryptocurrency firms, and other organizations. Over the past several
years, price wars and lower or no commission rates in the discount brokerage business in general have strengthened our competitors. In addition,
while the decline of commissions has been ongoing for decades, some of our competitors charging zero commissions on trades could potentially
have an adverse effect on our commission revenue.
The securities brokerage industry has experienced significant consolidation, which may continue in the future, likely increasing competitive
pressures in the industry. Consolidation could enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, or offer them on
better terms, such as higher interest rates paid on cash held in client accounts. We believe that such changes in the industry will continue to
strengthen existing competitors and attract additional competitors such as banks, insurance companies, providers of online financial and
information services, and others. Many of these competitors are larger, more diversified, have greater capital resources, and offer a wider range of
services and financial products than we do. We compete with a wide variety of vendors of financial services for the same customers. Many of these
competitors conduct extensive marketing campaigns and may have or achieve exceptional market name recognition. We may not be able to
compete effectively with current or future competitors with stronger capital position, greater name recognition or who partner or combine with
other larger firms.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 16

Some competitors in the discount brokerage business offer services which we may not offer. In addition, some competitors have continued
to offer flat rate execution fees that are lower than some of our published rates. Industry-wide changes in trading practices are expected to cause
continuing pressure on fees earned by discount brokers for the sale of order flow. Continued or increased competition from ultra-low cost, flat-fee
brokers and broader service offerings from other discount brokers could limit our growth or lead to a decline in our customer base which would
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we are not able to update or adapt our products and services
to take advantage of the latest technologies and standards, or are otherwise unable to offer services to mobile and desktop computing platforms to
a growing self-directed investor market, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.
Lower price levels in the securities markets may reduce our profitability.
Lower price levels of securities may result in (i) reduced volumes of securities, options and futures transactions, with a consequent
reduction in our commission revenues, and (ii) losses from declines in the market value of securities we hold in investment. In periods of low
volume, our levels of profitability are further adversely affected because certain of our expenses remain relatively fixed. Sudden sharp declines in
market values of securities and the failure of issuers and counterparties to perform their obligations can result in illiquid markets which, in turn,
may result in us having difficulty selling securities. Such negative market conditions, if prolonged, may lower our revenues. A reduction in our
revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are party to certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business.
For activity related to operations of StockCross prior to our acquisition of StockCross, FINRA’s Division of Enforcement is currently
investigating UIT transactions that were executed by StockCross that the enforcement staff believes were terminated early. We believe that many
of these transactions were UIT transactions that were the subject of our prior settlements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State
of California. All of these transactions occurred prior to our acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 17

Management cannot at this time assess either the duration or the likely outcome or consequences of the FINRA investigation. Nevertheless,
FINRA has the authority to impose sanctions on Siebert or require that it make offers of restitution to other customers who FINRA believes
incurred sales charges in early liquidations of UITs. No assurances can be given that a mutual settlement with FINRA regarding the investigation
can be reached or that any amount paid in settlement will not be material. Refer to Note 22 – “Commitments, Contingencies and Other” for more
detail.
As of December 31, 2021, in the opinion of management, all other legal matters are without merit, or involve amounts which would not have
a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES
Our Common Stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Market until June 29, 2011 when our Common Stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital
Market, under the symbol “SIEB.”
The closing sale price of our Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 14, 2022 was $2.00 per share. As of March
14, 2022, there were 84 holders of record of our Common Stock based on information provided by our transfer agent. The number of stockholders
of record does not reflect the number of individual or institutional stockholders that beneficially own our stock because most stock is held in the
name of nominees. Based on information available to us, we believe there are approximately 4,731 beneficial holders of our Common Stock as of
March 14, 2022.
Dividend Policy
Our Board of Directors periodically considers whether to declare dividends. In considering whether to pay such dividends, our Board of
Directors will review our earnings, capital requirements, economic forecasts and such other factors as are deemed relevant. Some portion of our
earnings will be retained to provide capital for the operation and expansion of our business.
Share Price Volatility
Since our Common Stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock has been relatively thinly traded and at times
been subject to price volatility. From January 1, 2021 to January 28, 2021, the average close price of our Common Stock was $3.94 per share. On
January 29, 2021, the price increased to a high of $18.50 per share and approximately 34 million shares were traded. From February 1, 2021 to
February 28, 2021, the average close price was $5.60 per share. The average daily trading volume from March 1, 2021 to March 1, 2022 was
approximately 271,000 shares. We have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that explain such
price volatility or trading volume.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSIONS AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
the related notes included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our
historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and
beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to
these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Overview
We are a financial services company and provide a wide variety of financial services to our clients. We operate in the following business
lines through our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries:
• Retail brokerage business through Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. (“MSCO”), a Delaware corporation and broker-dealer registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Commodity Exchange
Act of 1936, and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). MSCO engages in the business of providing
brokerage services for retail customers and trading securities for its own account.
• Investment advisory services through Siebert AdvisorNXT, Inc. (“SNXT”), a New York corporation registered with the SEC as a Registered
Investment Adviser (“RIA”) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. SNXT engages in providing investment advisory services to retail
and high net worth clients.
• Insurance services through Park Wilshire Companies, Inc. (“PW”), a Texas corporation and licensed insurance agency. PW provides
insurance agency services to retail and institutional accounts.
• Robo-advisory technology development through Siebert Technologies, LLC (“STCH”), a Nevada limited liability company.
• Prime brokerage services through RISE Financial Services, LLC (“RISE”), formerly known as WPS Prime Services, LLC (“WPS”), a Delaware
limited liability company and a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and NFA. RISE is a woman-owned and operated financial services firm
that offers a comprehensive suite of prime brokerage services aligned with the growing mission-driven Environmental Social and
Governance (“ESG”) initiatives of institutional investors.
• StockCross Digital Solutions, Ltd. (“STXD”), an inactive subsidiary headquartered in Bermuda.
Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of
the U.S. equity and fixed-income markets. Market volatility, overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political, and regulatory trends,
and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the
financial decisions made by market participants who include investors and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial
markets. In addition, in periods of reduced financial market activity, profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain
relatively fixed, including salaries and related costs, as well as portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses. Accordingly, earnings for
any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period.
COVID-19
Impact
Overview
The World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic in March 2020. The COVID‑19 pandemic has
adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to lower interest rates across the curve and heightened volatility in the financial markets.
We are actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the possible effects of the roll-out of various vaccines on our business, financial condition,
liquidity, operations, employees, clients and business partners.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 21

Financial Impact
In the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate to near zero. This decline in interest rates led to
a decrease in our revenue from interest, marketing and distribution fees, and may continue to have a negative impact on these revenue streams in
the near future.
The primary financial impact on Siebert from the COVID-19 pandemic for both the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was lower
interest revenue resulting from lower benchmark interest rates beginning in the first quarter of 2020.
Management Response
Operations
In response to the pandemic and for the protection of our employees, clients and business partners, we implemented remote work
arrangements for nearly 100% of our employees, restricted business travel and temporarily closed some of our branch offices. With our ability to
meet a vast majority of our clients' needs through our technology-based platforms and services, these arrangements did not materially affect our
ability to maintain our business operations. As of the date of this Report we have reopened all of our branch offices.
Expense Reduction
As of the date of this Report, we are actively involved in contract negotiations with key vendors to reduce many of our fixed costs. In
addition, we successfully transitioned certain branch offices out of legacy office space into more cost-efficient locations resulting in savings related
to rent and occupancy expense. We do not believe any of the changes described above will have a negative impact on the operations or financials of
our business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The situation surrounding COVID-19 has not materially impacted our liquidity position or future outlook as we have been able to meet all
obligations and believe we will be able to do so in the foreseeable future.
Conclusion
We note that the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on
future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the possible effects of the roll-out of various vaccines, which are uncertain and
cannot be predicted at this time. We are currently monitoring the COVID-19 situation and will continue to respond to meet the demands of our
clients as well as protect our employees.
Significant Events
Purchase of Office Building in Miami
On December 30, 2021, we acquired a commercial office building and associated property located at 653 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL
(“Miami office building”) for approximately $6.8 million. The Miami office building contains approximately 12,000 square feet of office space and
will be used as one of our primary operating centers.
Transaction with Tigress Holdings, LLC
On November 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Tigress, a Delaware limited liability company. As part of the agreement, (i)
Tigress transferred to us limited liability company membership interests representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the outstanding membership
interests in Tigress; and (ii) we transferred to Tigress limited liability company membership interests representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the
outstanding membership interests of RISE and 1,449,525 shares of Siebert common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized
$172,000 from our equity method investment in Tigress, which is within the line item titled, “Earnings of equity method investment in related
party” on the statements of income.
Tigress Financial Partners is a disabled and woman-owned financial services firm providing institutional and high net worth investors with
expertise in investment banking, capital markets, research, corporate advisory and global trade execution services, asset management and global
wealth management. Tigress Financial Partners serves as a strategic diversity partner to corporate issuers, bookrunners, hedge funds and private
equity firms.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 22

Relaunch of RISE Financial Services, LLC
As part of the transaction with Tigress, WPS Prime Services, LLC was renamed to RISE Financial Services, LLC, and Tigress’ founder,
Cynthia DiBartolo, will continue as CEO of Tigress, and assumed the position as CEO of RISE. Gloria E. Gebbia, one of Siebert’s and RISE’s
directors, assumed the position of Chief Impact Officer at RISE. Ms. DiBartolo was appointed to Siebert’s and RISE’s Board of Directors and Ms.
Gebbia was appointed to Tigress’ Board of Directors.
RISE relaunched its business as a woman-owned and operated prime brokerage with a specific emphasis on aligning the mission-driven
initiatives with the technological needs of institutional customers.
While we believe our expertise and industry relationships will enable us to execute our new strategic direction, our business plan for RISE is
new and untested, and it is uncertain whether our efforts will attract the prime brokerage customers and revenue necessary to compete in a new
market for prime customers. Any failure to adapt to these evolving trends may reduce our revenue or operating margins and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Arrangements with JonesTrading and Goldman Sachs
On August 30, 2021, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ("GSCO") notified RISE that its clearing arrangement with RISE will be terminated.
Due to the termination of RISE’s clearing arrangement with GSCO, substantially all the revenue producing customers of RISE have
transitioned to other prime service providers. Revenue from customers that have transitioned to other prime service providers was approximately
$12.6 million and $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Pre-tax income from these customers was
approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
As a result of this development, we recorded a full impairment of the RISE customer relationships intangible asset of $699,000 and RISE
collected its clearing deposit from GSCO of approximately $2 million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, RISE’s institutional customer assets
under management were significantly reduced in the year ended December 31, 2021.
On October 7, 2021, RISE signed an agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC (“JonesTrading”) to transfer certain customers
of RISE to JonesTrading. In exchange, JonesTrading agreed to pay RISE a percentage of the net revenue produced by those clients less any related
expenses. The percentage paid to RISE related to this agreement will decline every year and the arrangement will end in October 2024. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, this agreement resulted in a net expense of $22,000 as RISE was in the process of transitioning certain customers
to JonesTrading. We do not anticipate the revenue related to this agreement will offset the reduction in revenue from customers that have
transitioned to other prime service providers.
Contract with NFS
Effective August 1, 2021, MSCO entered into an amendment to its clearing agreement with NFS that, among other things, extends the term
of their arrangement for an additional four-year period commencing on August 1, 2021 and ending July 31, 2025. As part of this agreement, we
received a one-time business development credit of $3 million, and NFS will pay us four annual credits of $100,000, which are recorded within the
line item “Deferred contract incentive” on the statements of financial condition. The business development credit and annual credits will be
recognized as contra expense over four years and one year, respectively, in the line item “Clearing fees, including execution costs” on the
statements of income. These credits reduced our expenses for clearing fees, including executions, by $354,000 for the year ended December 31,
2021, and we anticipate an annual expense reduction of approximately $850,000 for the years thereafter through the end of the agreement.
OpenHand
On January 31, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with OpenHand Holdings, Inc. (“OpenHand”) whereby we acquired an
interest of 5% of OpenHand common stock for consideration of a total of $2,231,000 consisting of $850,000 in cash and 329,654 restricted shares
of our common stock valued at $1,381,000 or $4.19 per share. We intended to develop a subscription-based brokerage platform with OpenHand,
providing zero-commission trading for equity and option transactions and crediting its members daily with rebates of revenues generated by the
clients, less operational expenses.
The value of our restricted stock was determined using the thirty-day trading average. We agreed to register the shares issued to OpenHand
by filing a selling shareholder registration statement. We also received an option to purchase an additional 7.5% of OpenHand for approximately
$4.5 million, based upon a $60 million valuation of OpenHand. This option expires 18 months after the launch of the OpenHand platform.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 23

On August 18, 2021, we agreed with OpenHand to terminate our working relationship. In connection therewith, Siebert and OpenHand
amended and restated their January 31, 2021 stock purchase agreement to provide that we would pay $850,000 in cash in exchange for 2% of the
outstanding common stock of OpenHand as of January 31, 2021, and receive a 15-month option to purchase an additional 2% of the outstanding
common stock of OpenHand at an exercise price equal to a company valuation of $42.5 million. The parties agreed to rescind OpenHand’s purchase
of the 329,654 restricted shares of our common stock.
StockCross Acquisition
Overview
Established in 1971, StockCross was one of the largest privately-owned brokerage firms in the nation and its operations consisted primarily
of market making, fixed-income products distribution, online and broker-assisted equity trading, securities lending, and equity stock plan services.
In January 2019, we acquired approximately 15% ownership of StockCross. Effective January 1, 2020, we acquired the remaining 85% of
StockCross’ outstanding shares in exchange for 3,298,774 shares of our common stock, and StockCross was merged with and into MSCO. As of
January 1, 2020, the business and operations of StockCross became part of MSCO, and all clearing and other services provided by StockCross were
performed by MSCO.
StockCross Highlights
We have completed the merger of StockCross into MSCO and the acquired business lines have added new revenue streams and
supplemented existing ones within MSCO. In addition, the nature of StockCross’ self-clearing business line requires the presentation of various
assets and corresponding liabilities on the statements of financial condition.
Operationally, the merger resulted in the expansion of our client services areas and provided additional resources for the combined client
base without any material loss of clients during the transition. Further, at the time of acquisition, StockCross added approximately $1.5 billion in
retail customer net worth and approximately 30,000 retail accounts to Siebert.
Effective March 16, 2021, MSCO received approval to become an IRA nonbank custodian and trustee. MSCO successfully completed the
custodian conversion from StockCross, and MSCO continues to offer IRA services to its clients.

Statements of Income and Financial Condition
Overview
The following table sets forth metrics we use in analyzing our financial performance for the periods indicated:
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2020
Revenue $ 67,507,000 $ 54,872,000
Income before provision for income taxes $ 6,754,000 $ 3,196,000
Net income available to common stockholders $ 5,063,000 $ 2,975,000
Statements of Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020
Revenue
Commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $18,252,000 and decreased by $1,927,000 from the corresponding
period in the prior year, primarily due to a loss in institutional customers due to the termination of GSCO’s clearing agreement with RISE.
Interest, marketing and distribution fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $12,897,000 and decreased by $1,298,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the reduction of 12b-1 fees from money market funds and lower interest received on bank
deposits from our retail customers of an aggregate of approximately $2 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately
$0.7 million in interest revenue from institutional customers that have since transitioned to other prime brokerages.
Principal transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $15,647,000 and increased by $3,797,000 from the corresponding period
in the prior year, primarily due to strong market conditions during 2021.
Market making for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5,897,000 and increased by $3,855,000 from the corresponding period in the
prior year, primarily due to favorable market conditions during 2021.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 26

Stock borrow / stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $11,864,000 and increased by $7,819,000 from the corresponding
period in the prior year, primarily due to the addition of key personnel, expansion of our stock locate revenues, and additional securities lending
and locate counterparty relationships. The increase in this business line was a significant component of the increase in our income before provision
for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the corresponding period in the prior year.
Advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,668,000 and increased by $526,000 from the corresponding period in the prior
year, primarily due to overall expansion of the advisory business line and favorable market conditions.
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,282,000 and decreased by $137,000 from the corresponding period in the prior
year, primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange volumes and a decrease in institutional custody fees.
Operating Expenses
Employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $36,424,000 and increased by $7,922,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to increased commission payouts corresponding to the increase in principal transactions,
market making, and stock borrow / stock loan revenue in 2021. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in commissions payouts from RISE
related to the loss of institutional customers.
Clearing fees, including execution costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $4,817,000 and decreased by $290,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the recognition of the business development credit and annual credits from NFS as contra
expense in 2021.
Technology and communications expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $4,762,000 and increased by $140,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in software licenses and technology support services.
Other general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3,686,000 and increased by $1,322,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in regulatory fees and exchange fees related to incremental trading volumes
and counterparties, as well as an increase in office expenses and insurance cost.
Data processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,849,000 and increased by $52,000 from the corresponding period
in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our service bureau costs.
Rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,930,000 and decreased by $837,000 from the corresponding
period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in rent from our transition out of legacy office space into more cost-efficient locations as well
as the termination of certain leases within RISE.
Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2,695,000 and decreased by $169,000 from the corresponding period in the
prior year, primarily due to a decrease in legal fees.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,445,000 and decreased by $121,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to the full impairment of the RISE customer relationships intangible asset in August 2021.
Referral fees for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,213,000 and increased by $475,000 from the corresponding period in the prior
year, primarily due to RISE entering into a referral fee arrangement with a significant customer in 2021.
Impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $699,000 and increased by $699,000 from the corresponding period in the prior
year, primarily due to the impairment of the RISE customer relationships intangible asset due to the termination of RISE’s clearing arrangement
with GSCO.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $361,000 and increased by $12,000 from the corresponding period in the prior
year, primarily due to a full year of interest on the line of credit with East West Bank in 2021, partially offset by a reduction in notes payable
related party in 2021.
Advertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $44,000 and increased by $44,000 from the corresponding period in the
prior year, due to an increase in various promotional expenses.
Earnings of Equity Method Investment in Related Party
Earnings of equity method investment in related party for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $172,000 and increased by $172,000 from
the corresponding period in the prior year, due to the Company recognizing its proportional earnings from Tigress for 2021.

Provision For Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,721,000 and increased by $1,500,000 from the corresponding
period in the prior year. Refer to Note 19 – “Income Taxes” for additional detail.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
We are the majority owner of RISE, as such, operate and control all of the business and affairs of RISE and consolidate RISE’s financial
results into our financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, we held approximately 76% ownership interest in RISE, and Tigress held 24%
ownership interest in RISE. We reflect Tigress’ ownership of RISE as a noncontrolling interest in our financial statements. The net loss attributable
to noncontrolling interests for the two months and the year ended December 31, 2021 was $30,000, and increased by $30,000 from the
corresponding period in the prior year.
Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2021 and 2020
Assets
Assets as of December 31, 2021 were $1,404,235,000 and increased by $31,248,000 from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase
in securities borrowed. In addition, there was an increase in property related to the purchase of the Miami office building and our equity method
investment in Tigress; however, these were substantially offset by a decrease in receivables from customers and receivables from broker-dealers
and clearing organizations.
Liabilities
Liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were $1,353,729,000 and increased by $18,728,000 from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an
increase in securities loaned, debt from the mortgage with East West Bank, as well as the deferred contract incentive from NFS.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
In terms of the overall performance of the business in relation to liquidity, for the periods presented, we have had strong operating cash
flows despite lower interest rates and the effects of COVID-19. We also have had sufficient cash flows to meet liquidity needs and believe our ability
to generate cash flows will continue into the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a variety of sources of borrowing capability such as a short-term overnight demand borrowing with BMO
Harris Bank, notes payable to Gloria E. Gebbia, and a line of credit and a mortgage with East West Bank.
The indicators of our liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, and as of the date of this Report, there are no known or material events that
would require us to use large amounts of our liquid assets to cover expenses. As of December 31, 2021, we had a sufficient amount of remaining
availability on our various credit lines to facilitate incremental capital needs.
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity, and overall access to capital markets are sufficient
to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.
Shelf Registration Statement
On February 18, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective on March 2, 2022 by the SEC for the
potential offering, issuance and sale by us of up to $100.0 million of our Common Stock, preferred stock, warrants to purchase our Common Stock
and/or preferred stock, units consisting of all or some of these securities and subscription rights to purchase all or some of these securities. The
registration statement was filed in reliance on General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of
securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period. Assuming we remain subject to General
Instruction I.B.6, at the time we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any
securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6 may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of
our outstanding Common Stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale as computed in accordance
with Instruction I.B.6. Whether we sell securities under the registration statement will depend on a number of factors, including the market
conditions at that time, our cash position at that time and the availability and terms of alternative sources of capital.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 28

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our cash and cash equivalents are unrestricted and are used primarily to fund our working capital needs. Our cash and cash equivalents as
of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $3.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
Net Capital, Reserve Accounts, Segregation of Funds, and Other Regulatory Requirements
MSCO is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rules of the SEC (Rule 15c3-1) and the Customer Protection Rule (15c3-3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and maintains capital and segregated cash reserves in excess of regulatory requirements. Requirements under these
regulations may vary; however, MSCO has adequate reserves and continency funding plans in place to sufficiently meet any regulatory
requirements. In addition to net capital requirements, as a self-clearing broker-dealer, MSCO is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements
with clearing houses, such as the DTCC and the Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the
nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility.
RISE, as a member of FINRA, is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1. This rule requires the maintenance of minimum net
capital and that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1 and that equity capital may not be
withdrawn, or cash dividends paid if the resulting net capital ratio would exceed 10 to 1. RISE is also subject to the CFTC's minimum financial
requirements which require that RISE maintain net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of its requirements under Regulation 1.17 under the
Commodity Exchange Act or Rule 15c3-1.
MSCO can transfer funds to Siebert as long as it maintains its liquidity and regulatory capital requirements. RISE can transfer funds to its
shareholders, of which Siebert is entitled to its proportional ownership interest, as long as RISE maintains its liquidity and regulatory capital
requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, MSCO and RISE had sufficient net capital to meet their respective liquidity and
regulatory capital requirements. Refer to Note 20 – “Capital Requirements” for more detail on our capital requirements.
Sources of Liquidity
Mortgage with East West Bank
On December 30, 2021, we entered into a mortgage with East West Bank for approximately $4 million to finance part of the purchase of the
Miami office building.
Our obligations under the mortgage are secured by a lien on the Miami office building and the term of the loan is ten years. The repayment
schedule will utilize a 30-year amortization period, with a balloon on the remaining amount due at the end of ten years. The agreement contains
certain financial and non-financial covenants, and as of December 31, 2021, we have an unused commitment of $338,000 with East West Bank
which we intend to use for the build out of the Miami office building. Refer to Note 13 – “Long-Term Debt” for additional detail on this agreement.
Future remaining annual minimum principal payments for the mortgage with East West Bank as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
Amount
2022 $ —
2023 70,000
2024 78,000
2025 81,000
2026 84,000
Thereafter 3,737,000
Total $ 4,050,000
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 29

Line of Credit with East West Bank
On July 22, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with East West Bank. In accordance with the terms of this agreement, we
have the ability to borrow term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $10 million during the two-year period after July 22, 2020.
The agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, and our obligation under the agreement is guaranteed pursuant to a
guarantee agreement by and among, John J. Gebbia, Gloria E. Gebbia and a trust for which they are mutually co-trustees.
As of December 31, 2021, we have drawn down a $5.0 million term loan under this agreement which has an outstanding balance of $3.7
million. We have an additional $5.0 million remaining to draw down from this line of credit. Both lending agreements with East West Bank are
considered senior debt facilities. Refer to Note 13 – “Long-Term Debt” for additional detail on this agreement.
Future remaining annual minimum principal payments for the line of credit with East West Bank as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
Amount
2022 $ 998,000
2023 998,000
2024 1,661,000
Total $ 3,657,000
Notes Payable – Related Party
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in notes payable to Gloria E. Gebbia. As of December
31, 2021, these notes payable have maturity dates in 2022 and we have sufficient liquidity to meet all maturities of these notes. Refer to Note 14 –
“Notes Payable - Related Party” for additional detail.
Overnight Financing
As of December 31, 2021, we had an available line of credit for short term overnight demand borrowing of up to $15 million with BMO
Harris Bank. As of December 31, 2020, we had $15 million line of credit with BMO Harris Bank and a $15 million line of credit with Texas Capital
Bank, the latter of which was not renewed as of December 31, 2021. The removal of this line of credit was the result of Texas Capital Bank exiting
the business line and did not impact our ability to meet liquidity requirements.
As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding loan balance and there were no commitment fees or other restrictions on this line of
credit. MSCO utilizes customer or firm securities as a pledge for short-term borrowing needs.
Statements of Cash Flows
The total changes in our statements of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of the ongoing results of our business as we have customer
assets and liabilities on our statements of financial condition.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had positive operating cash flow. We had investing cash outflows related to the purchase of the
Miami office building, equity of OpenHand, software assets and miscellaneous office facilities. We had financing cash inflow related to the
mortgage from East West Bank to finance part of the purchase of the Miami office building as well as an incremental notes payable from Gloria E.
Gebbia.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had positive operating cash flow and a minor investing cash outflow related to software
development. We had a financing cash inflow for the line of credit secured with East West Bank and for the shares issued for employee stock
purchases, which was partially offset by a financing cash outflow for the maturation of a portion of the notes payable from Gloria E. Gebbia.
Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $3.8 million and increased from the same period in the prior
year. There is an estimated $700,000 in build out costs for the Miami office building that will be incurred in 2022, of which approximately 50% will
be financed by East West Bank. We believe we will have sufficient cash flows to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 30

Leases
As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of our lease payments for 2022 for operating leases with initial terms of greater than one
year was $1.3 million. The remaining balance of the lease payments for these leases after 2022 was $1.8 million. Refer to Note 9 – “Leases” for
more detail on our lease arrangements and corresponding disclosures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into various transactions to meet the needs of customers, conduct trading activities, and manage market risks and are, therefore,
subject to varying degrees of market and credit risk.
In the normal course of business, our customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer securities
transactions. These activities may expose us to off-balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contracted
obligations and we are forced to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss.
Our customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, we extend credit to our
customers, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in the customers' accounts. In
connection with these activities, we execute and clear customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of
which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. As of December 31, 2021, we had margin loans extended to
customers of approximately $0.6 billion, of which $84.2 million is within the line item “Receivables from customers” on the statements of financial
condition.
Such transactions may expose us to off-balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that
customers may incur. In the event the customer fails to satisfy obligations, we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at
prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer's obligations.
We seek to control the risks associated with our customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with
various regulatory requirements and internal guidelines which meet or exceed regulatory requirements. We monitor required margin levels daily
and pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.
Our customer financing and securities settlement activities may require us to pledge customer securities as collateral in support of various
secured financing sources such as bank loans and securities loaned. In the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligation to
return customer securities pledged as collateral, we may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to
satisfy customer obligations. We seek to mitigate this risk by monitoring the market value of securities pledged on a daily basis and by requiring
adjustments of collateral levels in the event of excess market exposure. In addition, we establish credit limits for such activities and continuously
monitor compliance.
Our securities lending transactions are subject to master netting agreements with other broker-dealers; however, amounts are presented
gross in the statements of financial condition. We further mitigate risk by using a program with a clearing organization which guarantees the
return of cash to us as well as using industry standard software to ensure daily changes to market value are continuously updated and any changes
to collateralization are immediately covered.
There were no material losses for unsettled customer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued under ASC 740-10, which addresses the
determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. We may
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by
the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such position
should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC
740-10 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 31

As of December 31, 2021, we recorded an uncertain tax position of $2,418,000 related to various tax matters. As of December 31, 2020, we
recorded an uncertain tax position of $1,105,000 related primarily to our 2017 to 2019 amended tax returns, as the anticipated tax refunds exceed
the amount that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the provision for income taxes line item in the statements of
income. Accrued interest and penalties would be included on the related tax liability line in the statements of financial condition.
Long Term Contracts
Contract with NFS
Effective August 1, 2021, MSCO entered into an amendment to its clearing agreement with NFS that, among other things, extends the term
of their arrangement for an additional four-year period commencing on August 1, 2021 and ending July 31, 2025. As part of this agreement, we
received a one-time business development credit of $3 million, and NFS will pay us four annual credits of $100,000 over the term of the agreement.
The amendment also provides for an early termination fee; however, as of December 31, 2021, we do not expect to terminate the contract with NFS
before the end of the contract term. Refer to Note 15 – “Deferred Contract Incentive” and Note 22 – “Commitments, Contingencies and Other” for
additional detail.
Prepaid Service Contract
We entered into an agreement with InvestCloud for development work related to our online platform. As part of this agreement, we have an
obligation to pay for the license fees associated with the InvestCloud Platform for a three-year term. Refer to Note 5 – “Prepaid Service Contract”
for additional detail.
Related Party Disclosures
During the course of business, we enter into various agreements and transactions with related parties. Refer to Note 24 – “Related Party
Disclosures” for additional detail.
Fair Value Measurements
We have securities that are valued using the fair value framework under ASC 820 within our assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021
and 2020. The majority of these assets are level 1 U.S. government securities and equity securities and level 2 equity securities in the line item
“Securities owned, at fair value” on the statements of financial condition. The liabilities consist of relatively small amounts of level 2 equity
securities in the line item “Securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value.” Refer to Note 6 – “Fair Value Measurements” for additional detail.
Impairment
We have concluded as of December 31, 2021 that there has been no impairment to the carrying value of Siebert’s goodwill and tangible
assets. However, due to the termination of RISE’s clearing arrangement with GSCO, substantially all of the revenue producing customers of RISE
have transitioned to other prime service providers. The forecasted revenue associated with RISE’s historical customer base was determined to be
minimal. As such, we determined that the RISE customer relationships intangible asset was fully impaired, resulting in an impairment loss of
$699,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 12 – “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” for additional information.
Segment
We concluded as of December 31, 2021, Siebert is comprised of a single operating segment based on the factors related to management’s
decision-making framework as well as management evaluating performance and allocating resources based on assessments of Siebert from a
consolidated perspective.
Subsequent Events
From January 31, 2022 to the date of this Report, RISE issued and Siebert sold membership interests in RISE to certain employees,
directors, and affiliates of RISE and Siebert. This amount represented, as of the date of this Report, an aggregate of 7% of the total issued and
outstanding membership interests in RISE.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 32

Transaction with Hedge Connection
On January 21, 2022, RISE entered into an agreement with Hedge Connection, Inc. (“Hedge Connection”), a Florida corporation and a
woman-owned fintech company founded by Lisa Vioni that provides capital introduction software solutions for the prime brokerage industry.
Pursuant to the agreement, Hedge Connection transferred to RISE common stock representing twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding
post-closing issued and outstanding capitalization in Hedge Connection and an option from Ms. Vioni to acquire 100% of the remaining interest in
Hedge Connection at fair value market at the time of the option exercise, provided such valuation of Hedge Connection is not less than $5 million
for a consideration of $1,000,000. This consideration is to be paid in three cash installments over 180 days totaling $600,000 as well as
approximately 3.33% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of RISE.
In addition, RISE acquired a technology license agreement from Hedge Connection to use its capital introduction software, Fintroz, for an
annual license fee of $250,000, Ms. Vioni provided RISE with the right to appoint one director to the Board of Directors of Hedge Connection, and
Ms. Vioni was appointed to the Board of Directors of RISE as well as to the position of President of RISE Prime – Capital Introduction, a division of
RISE.
Shelf Registration Statement
On February 18, 2022, Siebert filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, File No. 333-262895, pursuant to General
Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 (the “Baby Shelf Rule”), that was declared effective on March 2, 2022 (the “Registration Statement”). Siebert may
from time to time sell any combination of the securities described in the Registration Statement in one or more offerings up to an aggregate
offering price of $100.0 million; provided, however, at the time Siebert sells securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, the amount of
securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities it has sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on General Instruction I.B.6 may not
exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of Siebert’s outstanding Common Stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days
immediately preceding such sale as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6 while Siebert remains subject to the Baby Shelf Rule.
Other Items
On September 17, 2021, Siebert’s shareholders approved the Siebert Financial Corp. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) at Siebert’s
2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, and other equity awards of Siebert’s
common stock to employees, officers, consultants, directors, affiliates, and other service providers of Siebert. There are 3 million shares reserved
under the Plan, and Siebert issued no securities under the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
We are party to certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. All of the below legal matters are related to
activities related to operations of StockCross Financial Services, Inc. (“StockCross”), prior to our acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020.
On July 14, 2021, StockCross entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent with FINRA in connection with alleged excessive
trading and suitability violations by a registered representative of StockCross in a customer’s account, supervisory failures to comply with
supervisory requirements relating to certain equity and options and stock lending transactions, and certain record keeping requirements. Pursuant
to the consent, we agreed to a censure, pay a fine of $250,000, and made an undertaking to retain an independent consultant to conduct a
comprehensive review of our compliance with suitability rules in connection with solicited equity and options transactions, as well as possession-or-
control requirements in connection with the firm’s stock loan business. As of December 31, 2021, this legal matter has been resolved and we paid
$250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is within the line item “Other general and administrative” in the statement of income.
On July 9, 2021, StockCross entered into a Consent Order with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation in
connection with alleged supervisory failures relating to the sale of Unit Investment Trusts to six customers. Pursuant to the consent order, we
agreed to desist and refrain from violations of California law relating to supervision by broker-dealers, to make a payment of $100,000 to the
California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for administrative costs, and to offer restitution of commissions of approximately
$315,000 in aggregate to the six customers. We paid $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to this legal matter, which is within
the line item “Other general and administrative” in the statements of income. As of December 31, 2021, this legal matter has been resolved and the
six customers rejected the offer of restitutions.
For activity related to operations of StockCross prior to our acquisition of StockCross, FINRA’s Division of Enforcement is currently
investigating UIT transactions that were executed by StockCross that the enforcement staff believes were terminated early. We believe that many
of these transactions were UIT transactions that were the subject of our prior settlements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State
of California. All of these transactions occurred prior to our acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020. Management cannot at this time assess
either the duration or the likely outcome or consequences of the FINRA investigation. Nevertheless, FINRA has the authority to impose sanctions
on us or require that it make offers of restitution to other customers who FINRA believes incurred sales charges in early liquidations of UITs. No
assurances can be given that a mutual settlement with FINRA regarding the investigation can be reached or that any amount paid in settlement will
not be material.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 33

As of December 31, 2021, all other legal matters are without merit or involve amounts which would not have a material impact on our
results of operations or financial position.
New Accounting Standards
We have determined that all accounting standards and policies adopted in the year ended December 31, 2021 did not have a material
impact on our financial statements. Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional detail.
Critical Accounting Policies
Overview
We generally follow accounting policies standard in the brokerage industry and believe that our policies appropriately reflect our financial
position and results of operations. Our management team makes significant estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements. The
estimates relate primarily to revenue and expense items in the normal course of business as to which we receive no confirmations, invoices, or
other documentation, at the time the books are closed for a period. We use our best judgment, based on our knowledge of revenue transactions and
expenses incurred, to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses. We are not aware of any material differences between the estimates used
in closing our books for the last five years and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when we subsequently receive the actual
confirmations, invoices or other documentation.
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant
impact on our financial results. We believe that the following areas are particularly subject to management's judgments and estimates and could
materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional
detail on our significant accounting policies.
Revenue recognition
We have appropriate revenue recognition policies for each our revenue streams. Refer to Note 16 – “Revenue Recognition” for additional
detail on our revenue recognition policies.
Estimates of effective income tax rates, uncertain tax positions, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances.
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax
assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a
determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,
projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize deferred
taxes in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which
would reduce the provision for income taxes.
We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is
more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that
meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 34

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the provision for income taxes line in the statements of income.
Accrued interest and penalties would be included on the related tax liability line in the statements of financial condition.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill is recognized as a result of business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired.
The valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets requires significant judgment and estimates by management. For example, the
valuation of certain intangible assets required management’s estimates of future earnings and cash flows as well as judgment in determining
market approaches. The useful life of the finite lived intangible assets was determined based on management's estimate of the period over which
those intangible assets were expected to provide economic benefit. Management applies judgment in conducting impairment testing for goodwill
and intangible assets, including estimates of fair value based on the income or market approach and estimates required to determine the useful
lives of finite lived intangible assets.
We test goodwill and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable, or at least annually. If our estimates of fair value change due to future events differing significantly from the forecasts used
to determine fair value or there are changes in our business or other factors, we will assess the amount of impairment and recognize it in our
financial statements during that reporting period.
We also evaluate the useful life of finite lived intangible assets on an annual basis to determine if events or trends warrant a change in
estimate of the useful life. Changes in the estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets could result in the recognition of an impairment or a
change in the remaining life of these assets.
We have concluded that as of December 31, 2021, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of Siebert’s goodwill; however, there
has been an impairment of $699,000 to the RISE customer relationships intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the
termination of GSCO’s clearing arrangement with RISE.
Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 12 – “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” for additional detail.
Accruals for contingent liabilities
Accruals for contingent liabilities related to legal and regulatory claims as well as employee healthcare expenses under our self-insured plan
reflect an estimate of probable losses. In making such estimates for legal and regulatory claims, we consider many factors, including the progress
of the matter, prior experience and the experience of others in similar matters, available defenses, insurance coverage, indemnification provisions
and the advice of legal counsel and other experts. In making such estimates for employee healthcare expenses, we consider many factors, including
trends of our health insurance expenses and our insurance reserve limits. We believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are
sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, but there can be no assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or
in excess of our insurance limits. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost may be materially different than
the estimated costs. Refer to Note 22 – “Commitments, Contingencies and Other” for additional detail.
Allowance for credit losses
Management adopted CECL for Siebert which changed the methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses from an incurred loss
model to current expected loss model. Management applied quantitative and qualitative assessments in determining the risk characteristics and
pooling different assets that are carried at amortized cost. Management applied the collateral maintenance practical expedient for the secured
receivables and fully reserved the unsecured assets that are greater than 90 days past due. Adoption of CECL did not have a material impact on the
financial statements due to the existing credit management policies and short-term nature of the assets.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Financial Instruments Held For Trading Purposes
We do not directly engage in derivative transactions, have no interest in any special purpose entity and have no liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, for the debt of another entity.
Financial Instruments Held For Purposes Other Than Trading
We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents temporarily in dollar denominated bank account(s). These investments are not subject to
material changes in value due to interest rate movements.
Customer transactions are cleared through clearing brokers on a fully disclosed basis and are also self-cleared by MSCO. If customers do
not fulfill their contractual obligations, any loss incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities at prevailing market prices to satisfy
customer obligations may be incurred by Siebert. We regularly monitor the activity in customer accounts for compliance with margin requirements.
We are exposed to the risk of loss on unsettled customer transactions if customers and other counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual
obligations. There were no material losses for unsettled customer transactions in the last five years.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PCAOB ID 23)
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Siebert Financial Corp.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Siebert Financial Corp. & Subsidiaries (the Company)
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.

SIEBERT FINANCIAL CORP. & SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization
Overview
Siebert Financial Corp., a New York corporation, incorporated in 1934, is a holding company that conducts the following lines of business
through its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries:
• Retail brokerage business through Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. (“MSCO”), a Delaware corporation and broker-dealer registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Commodity Exchange
Act of 1936, and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). MSCO engages in the business of providing
brokerage services for retail customers and trading securities for its own account.
• Investment advisory services through Siebert AdvisorNXT, Inc. (“SNXT”), a New York corporation registered with the SEC as a Registered
Investment Adviser (“RIA”) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. SNXT engages in providing investment advisory services to retail
and high net worth clients.
• Insurance services through Park Wilshire Companies, Inc. (“PW”), a Texas corporation and licensed insurance agency. PW provides
insurance agency services to retail and institutional accounts.
• Robo-advisory technology development through Siebert Technologies, LLC (“STCH”), a Nevada limited liability company.
• Prime brokerage services through RISE Financial Services, LLC (“RISE”), formerly known as WPS Prime Services, LLC (“WPS”), a Delaware
limited liability company and a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and NFA. RISE is a woman-owned and operated financial services firm
that offers a comprehensive suite of prime brokerage services aligned with the growing mission-driven Environmental Social and
Governance (“ESG”) initiatives of institutional investors.
• StockCross Digital Solutions, Ltd. (“STXD”), an inactive subsidiary headquartered in Bermuda.
For purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Siebert,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Siebert Financial Corp.,
MSCO, SNXT, PW, STCH, RISE, and STXD collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.
The Company is headquartered in New York, NY, with primary operations in New Jersey, Florida, and California. The Company has 12
branch offices throughout the U.S. and clients around the world. The Company’s SEC filings are available through the Company’s website at
www.siebert.com, where investors can obtain copies of the Company’s public filings free of charge. The Company’s common stock, par value $.01
per share, trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SIEB.”
The Company primarily operates in the securities brokerage and asset management industry and has no other reportable segments. All of
the Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were derived from its operations in the U.S.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company is comprised of a single operating segment based on the factors related to management’s decision-
making framework as well as management evaluating performance and allocating resources based on assessments of the Company from a
consolidated perspective.
Transaction with Tigress Holdings, LLC
On November 16, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Tigress, a Delaware limited liability company. As part of the
agreement, (i) Tigress transferred to the Company limited liability company membership interests representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the
outstanding membership interests in Tigress; and (ii) the Company transferred to Tigress limited liability company membership interests
representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the outstanding membership interests of RISE and 1,449,525 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The common stock was issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 43

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Siebert holds a controlling financial interest in RISE and therefore consolidates RISE within its financial
statements. Siebert owns the majority of RISE’s membership interest which has voting rights in proportion to its ownership interest in RISE.
Siebert’s ownership percentage of RISE as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 76% and 100%, respectively. These consolidated financial
statements reflect the results of operations and financial position of RISE, including consolidation of its investment in RISE. The noncontrolling
interests in RISE are reported as a component of total equity in the consolidated statement of financial condition.
As part of the transaction, WPS Prime Services, LLC was renamed to RISE Financial Services, LLC, and Tigress’ founder, Cynthia DiBartolo,
will continue as CEO of Tigress, and assumed the position as CEO of RISE. Gloria E. Gebbia, one of the Company’s and RISE’s directors, assumed
the position of Chief Impact Officer at RISE. Ms. DiBartolo was appointed to the Company’s and RISE’s Board of Directors and Ms. Gebbia was
appointed to Tigress’ Board of Directors.
RISE relaunched its business as a woman-owned and operated prime brokerage with a specific emphasis on aligning the mission-driven
initiatives with the technological needs of institutional customers.
Arrangements with JonesTrading and Goldman Sachs
On August 30, 2021, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ("GSCO") notified RISE that its clearing arrangement with RISE will be terminated.
Due to the termination of RISE’s clearing arrangement with GSCO, substantially all the revenue producing customers of RISE have
transitioned to other prime service providers. Revenue from customers that have transitioned to other prime service providers was approximately
$12.6 million and $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Pre-tax income from these customers was
approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
As a result of this development, the Company recorded a full impairment of the RISE customer relationships intangible asset of $699,000
and RISE collected its clearing deposit from GSCO of approximately $2 million as of December 31, 2021. In addition, RISE’s institutional customer
assets under management were significantly reduced in the year ended December 31, 2021.
On October 7, 2021, RISE signed an agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services, LLC (“JonesTrading”) to transfer certain customers
of RISE to JonesTrading. In exchange, JonesTrading agreed to pay RISE a percentage of the net revenue produced by those clients less any related
expenses. The percentage paid to RISE related to this agreement will decline every year and the arrangement will end in October 2024. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, this agreement resulted in a net expense of $22,000 as RISE was in the process of transitioning customers to
JonesTrading.
COVID-19
The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly starting in the first quarter of 2020. COVID-
19 spread across the globe during 2020 and impacted economic activity worldwide. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments
around the world instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses,
curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing.
The primary financial impact on the Company from the COVID-19 pandemic for both the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was lower
interest revenue resulting from lower benchmark interest rates beginning in early 2020.
The Company is actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on its business, financial condition, liquidity, operations, employees, clients and
business partners. Based on management’s assessment as of December 31, 2021, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the
related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 44

Acquisition of StockCross
On January 25, 2019, the Company purchased approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of StockCross Financial Services, Inc.
(“StockCross”). Subsequently, the Company acquired the remaining 85% of StockCross’ outstanding shares in exchange for 3,298,774 shares of the
Company’s common stock. The Company’s common stock was issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Effective January 1, 2020, StockCross was merged with and into MSCO, and as of January 1, 2020, all clearing and other services provided by
StockCross were performed by MSCO.
Prior to and as of the date of the Company’s acquisition of StockCross, the Company and StockCross were entities under common control of
Gloria E. Gebbia, the Company’s principal stockholder, and members of her immediate family (collectively, the “Gebbia Family”). The acquisition
represented a change in reporting entity.

to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Siebert and its wholly-owned
and majority-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency of the Company and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.
The Company’s investments in non-majority-owned partnerships and affiliates are accounted for using the equity method until such time
that they become wholly or majority-owned. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded on the statements of income relating to
wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries with the appropriate noncontrolling interest that represents the portion of equity not related to the
Company’s ownership interest recorded on the statements of financial condition in each period.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
These estimates relate primarily to revenue and expenses in the normal course of business as to which the Company receives no
confirmations, invoices, or other documentation at the time the books are closed. The Company uses its best judgment, based on knowledge of
these revenue transactions and expenses incurred, to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company is not aware of any material differences between the estimates used in closing the Company’s books for the last five years
and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when the Company subsequently receives the actual confirmations, invoices, or other
documentation.
Estimates are used in the allowance for credit losses, valuation of certain investments, intangible asset valuations and useful lives,
depreciation, income taxes, and the contingent liabilities related to legal and healthcare expenses. The Company also estimates the valuation
allowance for its deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria. The Company believes that its estimates are reasonable.
Accounting for Acquisitions
ASC 805 is used for accounting in business acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that goodwill be recognized separately from assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill, as of the date of acquisition, is determined as the excess of the consideration
transferred net of the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value estimates at acquisition date may be
assessed internally or externally using third parties. As part of the valuation and appraisal process, the third-party appraiser prepares a report
assigning estimated acquisition date fair values to assets and liabilities. These fair value estimations are subjective and require careful
consideration and sound judgment. Management reviews the third-party reports for fairness of the assigned values.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose contra-parties include broker-dealers, banks and other financial
institutions.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 45

In the event contra-parties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may sustain a loss if the market value of the instrument is different
from the contract value of the transaction. The risk of default primarily depends upon the credit worthiness of the contra-parties involved in the
transactions. It is the Company’s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each contra-party with which it conducts business. The
Company has experienced no material historical losses in relation to its contra-parties for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company maintained its cash balances at various financial institutions. These balances are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000 per institution. The Company is subject to credit risk to the extent that the
financial institution with which it conducts business is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and deposits exceed FDIC limits.
Allowance for Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial-Instruments.”
This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss
model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses model (“CECL”). Under CECL, the allowance for credit losses on financial assets
that are measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial assets.
Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, would be recognized in
earnings, and adoption of the ASU will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Expected credit losses will be measured based on
historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and credit losses will be generally
recognized earlier than under previous U.S. GAAP.
The Company’s adoption of this ASU using the modified retrospective approach for all in-scope assets did not result in an adjustment to the
opening balance in retained earnings. The ASU impacts only those financial instruments that are carried by the Company at amortized cost such as
securities borrowed / loaned, receivables from customers, receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations, and other receivables. The
adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company's financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are all cash balances that are unrestricted. The Company has defined cash equivalents as highly liquid
investments with original maturities of less than 90 days that are not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and
2020, the Company did not hold any cash equivalents. At certain times, cash balances may exceed FDIC insured limits.
Cash and Securities Segregated For Regulatory Purposes
MSCO is subject to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3, referred to as the “Customer Protection Rule,” which requires segregation of funds in a
special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020 the Company did not have any securities
segregated for regulatory purposes. Effective upon the Company’s acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020, the requirements and special
reserve accounts of MSCO and StockCross were combined.
Receivables From and Payables To Customers
Receivables from and payables to customers include amounts due and owed on cash and margin transactions. Receivables from customers
include margin loans to securities brokerage clients and other trading receivables. Margin loans are collateralized by customers securities and are
carried at the amount receivable, net of an allowance for credit losses. Collateral is required to be maintained at specified minimum levels at all
times. The Company monitors margin levels and requires customers to provide additional collateral, or reduce margin positions, to meet minimum
collateral requirements if the fair value of the collateral changes. The Company expects the borrowers will continually replenish the collateral as
necessary because the Company subjects the borrowers to an internal qualification process to align investing objectives and risk tolerance in
addition to monitoring customer activity.
The Company elected the practical expedient for Topic 326 which permits it to compare the amortized cost basis of the loaned amount with
the fair value of collateral received at the reporting date to measure the estimate of expected credit losses. The Company has no expectation of
credit losses for its receivables from customers as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Securities beneficially owned by customers, including those
that collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected in the statements of financial condition.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 46

Receivables From, Payables To, and Deposits With Broker-Dealers and Clearing Organizations
Receivables from and payables to broker-dealers includes receivables from or payables to MSCO and RISE clearing broker-dealers, fail-to-
deliver and fail-to-receive items, and amounts receivable for unsettled regular-way transactions. Deposits with broker-dealers and clearing
organizations include amounts held on deposit with broker-dealers and clearing organizations.
Amounts payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations are offset against corresponding amounts receivables from broker-dealers
and clearing organizations. Receivables from these broker-dealers and clearing organizations are subject to clearing agreements and include the
net receivable from net monthly revenues as well as cash on deposit.
Receivables from and deposits with broker-dealers and clearing organizations are in scope of the amended guidance for Topic 326. The
Company continually reviews the credit quality of its counterparties and historically has not experienced a default. Further, management
reassessed the risk characteristics of its receivables and applied the collateral maintenance practical expedient for the secured receivables in line
with the CECL guidance. As a result, the Company has no expectation of credit losses for these arrangements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
MSCO customer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were both self-cleared and cleared on a fully disclosed basis
through National Financial Services Corp. (“NFS”). RISE customer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were cleared on
fully disclosed basis through GSCO and Pershing LLC (“Pershing”).
The Company signed a four-year renewal with NFS commencing August 1, 2021 and ending on July 31, 2025, and NFS’s fees are offset
against the Company’s revenues on a monthly basis. All other broker-dealer and clearing organization relationships operate on a month-to-month
basis.
Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned
Securities borrowed transactions are recorded at the amount of cash collateral delivered to the counterparty. Securities loaned are recorded
at the amount of cash collateral received. For securities borrowed and loaned, the Company monitors the market value of the securities and obtains
or refunds collateral as necessary.
The Company can elect to use an approach to measure the allowance for credit losses using the fair value of collateral where the borrower
is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in
the fair value of such collateral. The Company has elected to use this approach for its allowance for credit losses on securities borrowed. As a result
of this election, and the fully collateralized nature of these arrangements, the Company has no expectation of credit losses on its securities
borrowed balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Securities Owned and Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased at Fair Value
Securities owned, at fair value represent marketable securities owned by the Company at trade-date valuation. Securities sold, not yet
purchased, at fair value represent marketable securities sold by the Company prior to purchase at trade-date valuation.
Property, Office Facilities, and Equipment, Net
Property, office facilities, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation for equipment is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally not exceeding four years. Office facilities are
amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining lease term unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to
the lessee, or the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, in which case the lessee will amortize over the
estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements. Depreciation for property is calculated using the straight-line-method over the estimated
useful life of the property, not exceeding 40 years.
Software, Net
The Company capitalizes certain costs for software such as website and other internal technology development and amortizes them over
their useful life, generally not exceeding three years. Depending on the terms of the contract, the Company either records costs from software
hosting arrangements as prepaid assets and amortizes them over the contract term, or the costs are expensed as incurred.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 47

The Company enters into certain software hosting arrangements where the cost for professional development services is capitalized and
then amortized over the term of the contract.
Other software costs such as routine maintenance and various data services to provide market information to customers are expensed as
incurred.
Equity Method Investments
Investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting and are included in the equity method investment in related party line item in the statements of financial condition. Under
this method of accounting, the Company’s share of the net income or loss of the investee is presented before the income before provision for
income taxes on the statements of income.
The Company evaluates its equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of
such investments may be impaired. If the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company will recognize an impairment loss
equal to the difference between the expected realizable value and the carrying value of the investment.
Investments, Cost
The Company measures equity investments (other than equity method investments, controlling financial interests that result in consolidation
of the investee and certain other investments) at fair value and recognizes any changes in fair value in net income.
Pursuant to ASU 2020-01, the Company has made an accounting policy election to measure equity securities without readily determinable
fair value at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or
a similar investment of the same issuer.
Intangible Assets, Net
Certain identifiable intangible assets the Company acquires such as customer relationships and trade names are amortized over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense associated with such intangible assets is included in the line item
“Depreciation and amortization” on the statements of income.
The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes indicate the carrying value may not
be recoverable. The Company also evaluates the remaining useful lives of intangible assets on an annual basis or when events or changes warrants
the remaining period of amortization to be revised.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognized as a result of business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its equity is less than the carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value
exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is necessary; otherwise, the Company must perform a two-step quantitative assessment of
goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing a two-step quantitative assessment.
Payables to Non-Customers
Payables to non-customers includes amounts due on cash and margin transactions on accounts owned and controlled by principal officers
and directors of MSCO. Payables to non-customers amounts include any amounts received from interest on credit balances. Effective upon the
Company’s acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020, the Company no longer had any proprietary accounts of introducing broker-dealers.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 48

Drafts Payable
Drafts payable represent checks drawn by the Company against customer accounts which remained outstanding and had not cleared the
bank as of the end of the period.
Deferred Contract Incentive
The Company entered into an amendment with its agreement with NFS whereby the Company received a one-time business development
credit of $3 million, and NFS will pay the Company four annual credits of $100,000, which are recorded within the line item “Deferred contract
incentive” on the statements of financial condition. Annual credits shall be paid on the anniversary of the date on which the first credit was paid.
The business development credit and annual credits will be recognized as contra expense over four years and one year, respectively, in the line
item “Clearing fees, including execution costs” on the statements of income.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from contracts with customers and counterparties includes commissions and fees, principal transactions, market making, stock
borrow / stock loan, advisory fees, interest, marketing and distribution fees, as well as other income. The recognition and measurement of revenue
is based on the assessment of individual contract terms. Significant judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations are
satisfied at a point in time or over time, how to allocate transaction prices where multiple performance obligations are identified, when to recognize
revenue based on the appropriate measure of the Company’s progress under the contract, and whether constraints on variable consideration
should be applied due to uncertain future events.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $44,000 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, the Company
determines deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax
assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to be
realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company
determines that it would be able to realize deferred taxes in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company
determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for
those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the provision for income taxes line in the statements
of income. Accrued interest and penalties would be included on the related tax liability line in the statements of financial condition.
Capital Stock
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of a single class of common stock. Shares authorized were 100 million as of both
December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Per Share Data
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to the Company’s common stockholders by the weighted average
number of outstanding common shares during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to the Company’s
common stockholders by the number of shares outstanding under the basic calculation and adding, all dilutive securities, which consist of options.
The Company has no dilutive securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2021
ASU 2020-01 - In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method
and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic
815.” The ASU is based on a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force and is expected to increase comparability in accounting for these
transactions. ASU 2016-01 made targeted improvements to accounting for financial instruments, including providing an entity the ability to
measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Among other topics, the amendments
clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting. For
public business entities, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
ASU 2019-12 - In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”,
as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The ASU eliminates certain exceptions from ASC 740 related to the
approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities for outside basis differences. ASU 2019-12 also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU on
January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
ASU 2016-13 - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial-Instruments”. This ASU amends
several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other
models with the Current Expected Credit Losses model (“CECL”). Under CECL, the allowance for losses for financial assets that are measured at
amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial assets. Expected credit losses for
newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, would be recognized in earnings, and adoption of
the ASU will generally result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Expected credit losses will be measured based on historical experience, current
conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and credit losses will be generally recognized earlier than under
previous U.S. GAAP.
The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach for all in-scope assets, which did not result in
an adjustment to the opening balance in retained earnings. The ASU impacts only those financial instruments that are carried by the Company at
amortized cost such as securities borrowed / loaned, receivables from customers, non-customers, broker dealers and clearing organizations and
other receivables. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to the Company's financial statements.
Management has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will
have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures as of December 31, 2021.
3. Acquisitions
StockCross
Overview of Acquisition
Established in 1971, StockCross was one of the largest privately-owned brokerage firms in the nation and its operations consisted primarily
of market making, fixed-income products distribution, online or broker-assisted equity trading, securities lending, and equity stock plan services.
Prior to being acquired by the Company, StockCross and the Company were affiliated entities through common ownership and had various
related party transactions. In January 2019, the Company acquired approximately 15% ownership of StockCross. Effective January 1, 2020, the
Company acquired the remaining 85% of StockCross’ outstanding shares and StockCross was merged with and into MSCO. The purchase price paid
was approximately $29,750,000 or 3,298,774 shares of the Company’s common stock which was issued in connection with the acquisition. The
acquisition of StockCross added incremental business lines, revenue streams, cost synergies and additional experienced management team
members to MSCO.
Accounting for Acquisition
Prior to and as of the date of the acquisition, the Company and StockCross were entities under common control of the Gebbia Family. As
such, the acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.
The acquisition represented a change in reporting entity. As such, upon the closing of the acquisition, the net assets of the Company were
combined with those of StockCross at their historical carrying amounts and no goodwill was recorded as part of the transaction.

$905,000 and $937,000, respectively, which are included within the line item “Deposits with broker-dealers and clearing organizations” on the
statements of financial condition.
5. Prepaid Service Contract
On April 21, 2020, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”), with InvestCloud, Inc. (“InvestCloud”). Pursuant to the
MSA, InvestCloud agreed to provide the Company with the InvestCloud Platform, a new client and back end interface and related functionalities for
the Company’s key operations. The Company agreed to pay InvestCloud as consideration therefore during the initial three-year term an annual
license fee of $600,000 as well as an upfront professional service fee of $1.0 million for one-time configuration, installation and customization of the
software. Following the initial three-year term, the MSA will automatically renew for additional one-year terms unless terminated by the Company
upon 120 days’ notice.
In connection with the MSA, InvestCloud entered into a side letter agreement with the Company pursuant to which InvestCloud acquired
193,906 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock at a per share price of $5.81 (the Company’s share price as of the close of May 12, 2020)
for a total of $1.1 million for professional services, which approximates the cost of services to be provided, to integrate the InvestCloud Platform
into the Company’s existing systems. The common stock was issued on May 12, 2020 pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.
The Company initially recorded a prepaid asset equal to the $2.1 million of the total professional services related to the development work
to be performed by InvestCloud, which is within the line item “Prepaid service contract” on the statements of financial condition. The Company
amortizes this asset over the 3-year term of the contract, a period during which the arrangement is noncancelable. The license fees related to the
Company’s use of the InvestCloud Platform are prepaid three months in advance and are within the line item “Prepaid service contract” on the
statements of financial condition. These prepaid license fees are amortized over the three-month term. The amortization for all the prepaid assets
related to InvestCloud is within the line item “Technology and Communications” on the statements of income.
The expense related to share-based payments to InvestCloud for professional services was $376,000 and $219,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
The total cost related to InvestCloud was $959,000 and $764,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
6. Fair Value Measurements
Overview
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and establishes a hierarchy of fair value inputs. Fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market
for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Valuation techniques that are consistent with the
market, income, or cost approach, as specified by ASC 820, are used to measure fair value.
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for an identical asset or liability that the Company can assess at the measurement
date.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a variety of factors, such as the type of security,
the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are
less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. As such, the degree of judgment exercised
in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 52

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the
level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.
Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.
Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Company
believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Company’s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis is as follows:
U.S. government securities: U.S. government securities are valued using quoted market prices and as such, valuation adjustments are not
applied. Accordingly, U.S. government securities are generally categorized in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Certificates of deposit: Certificates of deposit are included in investments valued at cost, which approximates fair value. When certificates of
deposits are held directly with banking institutions and issued directly to the Company, these are categorized within cash equivalents in level 2 of
the fair value hierarchy. When certificates of deposits are available for trading, they are categorized within securities owned, at fair value in level 2
of the fair value hierarchy.
Corporate bonds: The fair value of corporate bonds is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (when
observable), bond spreads, or credit default swap spreads obtained from independent external parties such as vendors and brokers, adjusted for
any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments. The spread data used is for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does
not reference the issuer, then data that references a comparable issuer is used. When position-specific external price data is not observable, fair
value is determined based on either benchmarking to similar instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond, or single-name credit default
swap spreads and recovery rates as significant inputs. Corporate bonds are generally categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Equity securities: Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange. To the extent these securities are actively traded,
valuation adjustments are not applied, and they are categorized in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Securities quoted in inactive markets or with
observable inputs are categorized into level 2. If there are no observable inputs or quoted prices, securities are categorized as level 3 assets in the
fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets are not actively traded and subjective estimates based on managements’ assumptions are utilized for valuation.

A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Company’s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis is as follows:
Non-marketable equity securities: The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies that do not
have a readily determinable market value. Due to the absence of quoted market prices, these are classified as level 3 since considerable judgement
and estimation is involved in determining the fair value of these securities.
The table below summarized the total carrying value of Level 3 equity assets and changes made during the periods presented.
Changes in Level 3 Equity Assets
Year Ended December 31, 2020
Amount Valuation Technique Reason for Change
Securities owned, at fair value

Balance – January 1, 2020 $ 288,000 valuation report
Sale of equity security (288,000) Sale of equity security
Balance – December 31, 2020 $ —
The following represents financial instruments in which the ending balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are not carried at fair value
on the statements of financial condition:
Short-term financial instruments: The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents as well as cash
and securities segregated for regulatory purposes are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value of these instruments. These financial
instruments generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest
rates that approximate market rates. The Company had no cash equivalents or securities segregated for regulatory purposes as of December 31,
2021 and 2020. Cash and cash equivalents and cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes are classified as level 1.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 54

Receivables and other assets: Receivables from customers, receivables from non-customers, receivables from and deposits with broker-
dealers and clearing organizations, other receivables, prepaid service contract, and prepaid expenses and other assets are recorded at amounts
that approximate fair value and are classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The Company may hold cash equivalents related to rent
deposits that are categorized as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy in other receivables.
Securities borrowed and securities loaned: Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at amounts which approximate fair value
and are primarily classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s securities borrowed and securities loaned balances represent
amounts of equity securities borrow and loan contracts and are marked-to-market daily in accordance with standard industry practices which
approximate fair value.
Payables: Payables to customers, payables to non-customers, drafts payable, payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and taxes payable are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and
are classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
Notes payable – related party: The carrying amount of the notes payable – related party approximates fair value due to the relative short-
term nature of the borrowing. Under the fair value hierarchy, the notes payable – related party is classified as level 2.
Long-term debt: The carrying amount of the line of credit and mortgage with East West Bank approximates fair value as they reflect terms
that approximate current market terms for similar arrangements. Under the fair value hierarchy, the line of credit is classified as level 2.
Investments, cost: The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily
determinable market values. Due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair
value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. As there is no readily determinable fair value, the carrying amount of these
investments minus impairment approximates the fair value. The cost will be adjusted upwards or downwards in accordance with observable market
transactions and is recorded in the line item “Other general and administrative” in the statements of income. Under the fair value hierarchy, the
investments, cost is classified as level 3.

and 2020, respectively.
Purchase of Office Building
On December 30, 2021, the Company acquired the Miami office building located at 653 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL. The Miami office
building contains approximately 12,000 square feet of office space, which will be used as one of the primary operating centers for the Company.

31, 2021, the Company estimates future amortization of software assets of $506,000, $187,000, and $59,000, in the year ended December 31,
2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.
9. Leases
As of December 31, 2021, the Company rents office space under operating leases expiring in 2022 through 2026, and the Company has no
financing leases. The leases call for base rent plus escalations as well as other operating expenses. The following table represents the Company’s
lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the statements of financial condition. The Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e.,
leases with initial terms of less than twelve months), or equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the statements of financial condition.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company does not believe that any of the renewal options under the existing leases are reasonably certain to
be exercised; however, the Company will continue to assess and monitor the lease renewal options on an ongoing basis.
As of As of

Assets
Lease right-of-use assets $ 2,662,000 $ 2,290,000
Liabilities
Lease liabilities $ 2,933,000 $ 2,612,000
The calculated amounts of the lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term
and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company leases miscellaneous office equipment, but they are
immaterial and therefore the Company records the costs associated with this office equipment on the statements of income rather than capitalizing
them as lease right-of-use assets. The Company determined a discount rate of 5.0% would approximate the Company’s cost to obtain financing
given its size, growth, and risk profile.

The following table represents lease costs and other lease information. The Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate
lease and non-lease components, and as such, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance
and utilities which are usually determined by the leased square footage in proportion to the overall office building.

10. Equity Method Investment in Related Party
On November 16, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Tigress, a Delaware limited liability company. As part of the
agreement, (i) Tigress transferred to the Company limited liability company membership interests representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the
outstanding membership interests in Tigress; and (ii) the Company transferred to Tigress limited liability company membership interests
representing twenty-four percent (24%) of the outstanding membership interests of RISE, and 1,449,525 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The value of the shares of the Company’s common stock was determined using a 60-day average of the Company’s common stock price as reported
by the NASDAQ Capital Market. The common stock was issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Company’s ownership in Tigress is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In determining whether the investment in
Tigress should be accounted for under the equity method of accounting, the Company considered the guidance under ASC 323, Investments –
Equity Method and Joint Ventures. The Company maintains 24% ownership interest in Tigress, which represents a significant ownership level, the
Company and Tigress have common representation on their respective board of directors, and certain employees of Tigress are employees of RISE.
Based on these criteria, the Company determined that it was able to exercise significant influence of Tigress, and therefore the equity method of
accounting was used for this transaction.
This investment is reported in the equity method investment in related party in the statements of financial condition. Under the equity
method, the Company recognizes its share of Tigress’ income or loss in the earnings of equity method investment in related party line item on the
statements of income. The Company has elected to classify distributions received from equity method investees using the cumulative earnings
approach. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the earnings recognized from the Company’s investment in Tigress was $172,000 and the
Company did not receive any cash distributions. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of the investment in Tigress was $8,156,000.
The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. If the impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference
between the expected realizable value and the carrying value of the investment. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the investment in
Tigress is not estimated because there were no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair
value of the investment and thus, no impairment was recorded.

11. Investments, Cost
OpenHand
On January 31, 2021, the Company and OpenHand Holdings, Inc. (“OpenHand”) entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby the
Company acquired an interest of 5% of OpenHand common stock for consideration of a total of $2,231,000 consisting of $850,000 in cash and
329,654 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $1,381,000 or $4.19 per share. The Company’s common stock was issued
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company and OpenHand intended to develop a subscription-based
brokerage platform providing zero-commission trading for equity and option transactions and crediting its members daily with rebates of revenues
generated by the clients, less operational expenses.
The value of the Company’s restricted stock was determined using the thirty-day trading average. The Company agreed to register the
shares issued to OpenHand by filing a selling shareholder registration statement. The Company also received an option to purchase an additional
7.5% of OpenHand for approximately $4.5 million, based upon a $60 million valuation of OpenHand. This option expires 18 months after the launch
of the OpenHand platform.
On August 18, 2021, the Company and OpenHand agreed to terminate their working relationship. In connection therewith, the Company
and OpenHand amended and restated their January 31, 2021 stock purchase agreement to provide that the Company would pay $850,000 in cash
in exchange for 2% of the outstanding common stock of OpenHand as of January 31, 2021, and receive a 15-month option to purchase an additional
2% of the outstanding common stock of OpenHand at an exercise price equal to a company valuation of $42.5 million. The parties agreed to rescind
OpenHand’s purchase of the 329,654 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock.
No value was attributed to the option because it is not a derivative and there were no transaction costs associated with this option as of
December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in OpenHand was $850,000 and $0,
respectively.
The investment does not have a readily determinable fair value since OpenHand is a private company and its shares are not publicly traded.
The Company made an accounting policy election to measure this investment at cost less any impairment adjusted for any changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a loss on sale of $63,000 as a result of the August 18, 2021 amendment and is included
within the line item titled “Other general and administrative” on the statements of income. Management concluded that there have been no
additional adjustments as there were no other identified events or changes in circumstances during the reporting period that could have a
significant effect on the original valuation of the investment.
12. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net
Goodwill
Overview
As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s carrying amount of goodwill was $1,989,000, all of which came from the Company’s
acquisition of RISE.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 59

Impairment
On August 30, 2021, GSCO notified RISE that its clearing arrangement with RISE will be terminated. The termination of the clearing
arrangement was indicative of a potential impairment event and required impairment testing of the Company’s goodwill.
The Company elected to rely on a qualitative assessment to evaluate goodwill, which indicated that the fair value of the Company’s goodwill
was in excess of its carrying value. The Company concluded that it has one reportable segment and tested goodwill on a consolidated basis. In
addition to other qualitative factors such current market conditions and macro-economic factors, the Company’s market capitalization was above its
book value as of the date of the assessment. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, management concluded that there have been no impairments to
the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill and no impairment charges related to goodwill were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021
and 2020. Additionally, the Company determined there was not a material risk for future possible impairments to goodwill as of the date of the
assessment.
Intangible Assets, Net
Overview
As a result of the Company’s acquisition of RISE, the Company acquired intangible assets consisting of the RISE customer relationships and
trade name, the fair values of which were $987,000 and $70,000, respectively, as of the acquisition date. The Company amortizes its acquired
intangible assets over their useful lives and the intangible assets are deductible for tax purposes.
Impairment
The termination of GSCO’s clearing arrangement with RISE was indicative of a potential impairment event and required impairment testing
of the Company’s intangible assets.
The Company performed a qualitative assessment to evaluate definite-lived intangible assets. The qualitative assessment performed
indicated that the fair value of the RISE customer relationships intangible asset was less than its carrying amount, and the Company proceeded to
performing the quantitative assessment. Due to the termination of GSCO’s clearing arrangement with RISE, substantially all of the revenue
producing customers of RISE have transitioned to other prime service providers. The forecasted revenue associated with RISE’s historical customer
base was determined to be minimal. As such, the Company determined that the RISE customer relationships intangible asset was fully impaired,
resulting in an impairment loss of $699,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

15. Deferred Contract Incentive
Effective August 1, 2021, MSCO entered into an amendment to its clearing agreement with NFS that, among other things, extends the term
of their arrangement for an additional four-year period commencing on August 1, 2021 and ending July 31, 2025.
As part of this agreement, the Company received a one-time business development credit of $3 million, and NFS will pay the Company four
annual credits of $100,000, which are recorded within the line item “Deferred contract incentive” on the statements of financial condition. Annual
credits shall be paid on the anniversary of the date on which the first credit was paid. The business development credit and annual credits will be
recognized as contra expense over four years and one year, respectively, in the line item “Clearing fees, including execution costs” on the
statements of income. The amendment also provides for an early termination fee if the Company chooses to end its agreement before the end of the
contract term.
In relation to this agreement, the Company recognized $354,000 in contra expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the balance
of the deferred contract incentive was approximately $2.7 million as of December 31, 2021.
16. Revenue Recognition
Overview of Revenue
The primary sources of revenue for the Company are as follows:
Commissions and Fees
The Company earns commission revenue for executing trades for clients in individual equities, options, insurance products, futures, fixed
income securities, as well as certain third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Commission revenue associated with combined trade execution and
clearing services, as well as trade execution services on a standalone basis, is recognized at a point in time on the trade date when the performance
obligation is satisfied. The performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or
purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to / from the customer.
Principal Transactions
Principal transactions primarily represent riskless transactions in which the Company, after executing a solicited order, buys or sells
securities as principal and at the same time buys or sells the securities with a markup or markdown to satisfy the order. Principal transactions are
recognized at a point in time on the trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligation is satisfied on the trade
date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to / from the customer.
Market Making
Market making revenue is generated from the buying and selling of securities. Market making transactions are recorded on a trade-date
basis as the securities transactions occur. The performance obligation is satisfied on the trade date because that is when the underlying financial
instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to / from the
counterparty. Securities owned are recorded at fair market value at the end of the reporting period.
Stock Borrow / Stock Loan
The Company borrows securities on behalf of retail clients to facilitate short trading, loans excess margin and fully-paid securities from
client accounts, facilitates borrow and loan contracts for broker-dealer counterparties, and provides stock locate services to broker-dealer
counterparties. The Company recognizes self-clearing revenues net of operating expenses related to stock borrow / stock loan. Stock borrow / stock
loan also includes any revenues generated from the Company’s fully paid lending programs on a self-clearing or introducing basis. The Company
does not utilize stock borrow / stock loan activities for the purpose of financing transactions.
The performance obligation is satisfied on the contract date because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is
identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to / from the counterparty.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 63

For the year ended December 31, 2021, stock borrow / stock loan revenue was $11,864,000 ($29,441,000 gross revenue less $17,577,000
expenses). For the year ended December 31, 2020, stock borrow / stock loan revenue was $4,045,000 ($10,068,000 gross revenue minus
$6,023,000 expenses).
Advisory Fees
The Company earns advisory fees associated with managing client assets. The performance obligation related to this revenue stream is
satisfied over time; however, the advisory fees are variable as they are charged as a percentage of the client’s total asset value, which is
determined at the end of the quarter.
Interest, Marketing and Distribution Fees
The Company earns interest from clients’ accounts, net of payments to clients’ accounts, and on the Company’s bank balances. Interest
income also includes interest payouts from introducing relationships related to short interest, net of charges.
The Company also earns margin interest which is the net interest charged to customers for holding financed margin positions. Marketing
and distribution fees consist of 12b-1 fees which are trailing payments from money market funds. Interest, marketing and distribution fees are
recorded as earned.
Other Income
Other income represents revenue generated from correspondent clearing fees, corporate services client fees, payment for order flow, and
transactional fees generated from client accounts. Transactional fees are recorded concurrently with the related activity. Other income is recorded
as earned.

Soft Dollar Arrangement
For certain clients of RISE, the Company has soft dollar and commission sharing arrangements with customers that fall both within, and
outside of, the safe harbor provisions of Rule 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Rule 28(e)"), as amended. These soft dollar
arrangements were determined to be a separate performance obligation that should be allocated a portion of the transaction price.
Under these arrangements, the Company charges additional dollars on customer trades and uses these fees to pay third parties for
research, brokerage services, market data, and related expenses (“research services”) on behalf of clients. The Company is an agent in these
arrangements, as it does not control the research services before they are transferred to the customer. As such, the revenue from these agreements
are recognized net of cost within the line item “Commissions and fees” on the statements of income.
The Company paid client expenses of approximately $625,000 and $693,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company had an outstanding receivable and payable of approximately $30,000 and $247,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 related to
these arrangements.
The receivable and payable related to soft dollar arrangements are within the line items “Other receivables” and “Accounts payable and
accrued liabilities,” respectively, on the statements of financial condition.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no allowance for uncollectible commissions was necessary as the Company believes all commissions
receivable will be realized.
Other Items
For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no costs capitalized related to obtaining or fulfilling a contract with a
customer, and thus the Company has no balances for contract assets or contract liabilities. In addition, the acquisition of new entities did not
impact the Company’s existing revenue streams as the acquired entities had consistent application of the revenue recognition guidance. The
Company concludes that its revenue streams have the same underlying economic factors, and as such, no disaggregation of revenue is required.
17. Employee Stock Purchases
On November 10, 2020, the Company issued 150,000 shares of its restricted common stock to each of Anthony Palmeri and Gerard Losurdo,
each an employee of MSCO, as part of their employment agreements. Mr. Palmeri and Mr. Losurdo each paid the Company approximately
$400,000 for their common stock, which was equal to 70% of the closing price of the common stock as reported on Nasdaq on November 9, 2020.
The common stock issued to Mr. Palmeri and Mr. Losurdo was subject to a three-year restriction on transfer commencing on the day of issuance.
The issuance of the common stock was each approved by unanimous written consent of the Company's board of directors. The shares were
issued to Mr. Palmeri and Mr. Losurdo as part of their employment agreements in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and pursuant to
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The above transaction had no impact to the Company’s statements of income, but it is reflected in the Company’s statement of financial
condition, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity, and statement of cash flows within cash flows from financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2020.
18. Referral Fees
In relation to the operations of RISE, the Company has agreements with various third parties to share commissions and pay fees as defined
in the respective agreements. These expenses were approximately $1,213,000 and $738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, which are within in the line item “Referral fees” on the statements of income.

19. Income Taxes
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted in response to COVID-19 pandemic.
Under ASC 740, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period which the new legislation is enacted. The CARES Act
made various tax law changes including among other things (i) increased the limitation under IRC Section 163(j) for 2019 and 2020 to permit
additional expensing of interest (ii) enacted a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC
Section 168(k) and (iii) made modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in
2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes and (iv)
enhanced recoverability of AMT tax credits. The CARES Act did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:
Year Ending December 31,
2021 2020
Current
Federal $ 1,084,000 $ (176,000)
State and local 114,000 (82,000)

Total Deferred 523,000 479,000
Total Provision for income taxes $ 1,721,000 $ 221,000
The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% for 2021 and 2020 as follows:
Year Ending December 31,
2021 2020
Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0% 21.0%
Tax amortization of intangible assets (4.1%) (8.8%)
Non-deductible fines and penalties 0.8% —
Share based compensation 1.0% —
Permanent differences 0.8% 1.5%
State and local taxes, net of federal benefit 5.6% 2.5%
Change in valuation allowance — (5.2%)
Other 0.4% (4.1%)
Effective tax rate 25.5% 6.9%
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are
as follows:
As of December 31,
2021 2020
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating losses $ 5,437,000 $ 6,043,000
Lease liabilities 749,000 722,000
Share-based compensation — 61,000
Intangible assets — 2,000

Net Deferred tax assets
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 66

In assessing the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company evaluated whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or the entire deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating losses can be utilized. The Company
considered all positive and negative evidence when determining the amount of the net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be
realized. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, historical earnings, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning
strategies and projected future taxable income.
Based on historical operating profitability, positive trend of earnings and projected future taxable income, the Company concluded as of
December 31, 2021 that its U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis with the exception of certain federal net
operating losses that are expected to expire unutilized as a result of limitations imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and certain
state net operating losses. The amount of the Company’s valuation allowance did not change during 2021. The Company will continue to evaluate
its deferred tax assets to determine whether any changes in circumstances could affect the realization of their future benefit. If it is determined in
future periods that portions of the Company’s deferred income tax assets satisfy the realization standards, the valuation allowance will be reduced
accordingly.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $6.4 million which expire in
varying amounts in 2035 and 2036 if not utilized. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation under Section
382.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:
Amount
Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ —
Additions for tax positions taken during current year 1,105,000
Additions for tax positions taken during prior year —
Reductions for tax positions taken during prior years —
Settlements —
Expirations of statutes of limitations —
Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 1,105,000
Additions for tax positions taken during current year 1,315,000
Additions for tax positions taken during prior year —
Reductions for tax positions taken during prior years (2,000)
Settlements —
Expirations of statutes of limitations —
Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 2,418,000
Of the amounts reflected above as of December 31, 2021, the entire amount would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized.
The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of the provision for income taxes. For the year ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized expense related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $27,000 and $0,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the accrued balance of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was
$27,000 and $0, respectively. The Company does not believe that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease
within the next 12 months.
The Company files a federal income tax return and income tax returns in various state tax jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under
examination by the IRS or any state or local taxing authority for any tax year. The open tax years for the federal and state income tax filings is
generally 2018 through 2021.

Effective upon the Company’s acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020, the capital of MSCO and StockCross was combined.
Special Reserve Account
MSCO is subject to Customer Protection Rule 15c3-3 which requires segregation of funds in a special reserve account for the exclusive
benefit of customers. As of December 31, 2021, MSCO had cash deposits of $326.8 million in the special reserve accounts which was $31.9 million

Siebert 2021 Form-10K 68

RISE
Net Capital
RISE, as a member of FINRA, is subject to the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1. This rule requires the maintenance of minimum net
capital and that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1 and that equity capital may not be
withdrawn, or cash dividends paid if the resulting net capital ratio would exceed 10 to 1. RISE is also subject to the CFTC's minimum financial
requirements which require that RISE maintain net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of its requirements under Regulation 1.17 under the
Commodity Exchange Act or Rule 15c3-1.
As of December 31, 2021, RISE’s net capital was approximately $1.7 million which was $1.4 million in excess of its minimum requirement of
$250,000 under 15c3-1. As of December 31, 2020, RISE’s net capital was approximately $3.9 million which was $3.7 million in excess of its
minimum requirement of $250,000 under 15c3-1.
21. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company enters into various transactions to meet the needs of customers, conduct trading activities, and manage market risks and is,
therefore, subject to varying degrees of market and credit risk.
In the normal course of business, the Company's customer activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various customer
securities transactions. These activities may expose the Company to off-balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to
fulfill its contracted obligations and the Company has to purchase or sell the financial instrument underlying the contract at a loss.
The Company's customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, the Company extends
credit to its customers, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, and is collateralized by cash and securities in the
customers' accounts. In connection with these activities, the Company executes and clears customer transactions involving the sale of securities not
yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. As of December 31, 2021, the
Company had margin loans extended to its customers of approximately $0.6 billion, of which $84.2 million is within the line item “Receivables from
customers” on the statements of financial condition.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 69

Such transactions may expose the Company to off-balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses
that customers may incur. In the event the customer fails to satisfy obligations, the Company may be required to purchase or sell financial
instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer's obligations.
The Company seeks to control the risks associated with its customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in
compliance with various regulatory requirements and internal guidelines which meet or exceed regulatory requirements. The Company monitors
required margin levels daily and pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when
necessary.
The Company's customer financing and securities settlement activities may require the Company to pledge customer securities as collateral
in support of various secured financing sources such as bank loans and securities loaned. In the event the counterparty is unable to meet its
contractual obligation to return customer securities pledged as collateral, the Company may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at
prevailing market prices in order to satisfy its customer obligations. The Company seeks to mitigate this risk by monitoring the market value of
securities pledged on a daily basis and by requiring adjustments of collateral levels in the event of excess market exposure. In addition, the
Company establishes credit limits for such activities and continuously monitors compliance.
The Company’s securities lending transactions are subject to master netting agreements with other broker-dealers; however, amounts are
presented gross in the statements of financial condition. The Company further mitigates risk by using a program with a clearing organization which
guarantees the return of cash to the Company as well as using industry standard software to ensure daily changes to market value are continuously
updated and any changes to collateralization are immediately covered.
There were no material losses for unsettled customer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
22. Commitments, Contingencies and Other
Legal and Regulatory Matters
The Company is party to certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. All of the below legal matters are
related to activities related to operations of StockCross Financial Services, Inc. (“StockCross”), prior to the Company’s acquisition of StockCross on
January 1, 2020.
On July 14, 2021, StockCross entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent with FINRA in connection with alleged excessive
trading and suitability violations by a registered representative of StockCross in a customer’s account, supervisory failures to comply with
supervisory requirements relating to certain equity and options and stock lending transactions, and certain record keeping requirements. Pursuant
to the consent, the Company agreed to a censure, pay a fine of $250,000, and made an undertaking to retain an independent consultant to conduct
a comprehensive review of the Company’s compliance with suitability rules in connection with solicited equity and options transactions, as well as
possession-or-control requirements in connection with the firm’s stock loan business. As of December 31, 2021, this legal matter has been resolved
and the Company paid $250,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is within the line item “Other general and administrative” in the
statements of income.
On July 9, 2021, StockCross entered into a Consent Order with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation in
connection with alleged supervisory failures relating to the sale of Unit Investment Trusts to six customers. Pursuant to the consent order, the
Company agreed to desist and refrain from violations of California law relating to supervision by broker-dealers, to make a payment of $100,000 to
the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for administrative costs, and to offer restitution of commissions of approximately
$315,000 in aggregate to the six customers. The Company paid $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to this legal matter, which
is within the line item “Other general and administrative” in the statements of income. As of December 31, 2021, this legal matter has been
resolved and the six customers rejected the offer of restitutions.
For activity related to operations of StockCross prior to the Company’s acquisition of StockCross, FINRA’s Division of Enforcement is
currently investigating UIT transactions that were executed by StockCross that the enforcement staff believes were terminated early. All of these
transactions occurred prior to the Company’s acquisition of StockCross on January 1, 2020. Management cannot at this time assess either the
duration or the likely outcome or consequences of this matter. Nevertheless, FINRA has the authority to impose sanctions on the Company or
require that it make offers of restitution to other customers who FINRA believes incurred sales charges in early liquidations of UITs. No assurances
can be given that a mutual settlement with FINRA regarding these matters can be reached or that any amount paid in settlement will not be
material.
As of December 31, 2021, all other legal matters are without merit or involve amounts which would not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position.

Overnight Financing
As of December 31, 2021, MSCO had an available line of credit for short term overnight demand borrowing of up to $15 million with BMO
Harris Bank. As of December 31, 2021, MSCO had no outstanding loan balance with BMO Harris Bank and there were no commitment fees or other
restrictions on this line of credit.
As of December 31, 2020, in addition to the $15 million line of credit with BMO Harris Bank, MSCO had a $15 million line of credit with
Texas Capital Bank, which MSCO did not renew as of December 31, 2021. The removal of this line of credit was due to Texas Capital Bank exiting
the business line and did not impact MSCO’s ability to meet its liquidity requirements. MSCO utilizes customer or firm securities as a pledge for
short-term borrowing needs.
The interest expense for these credit lines was $17,000 and $19,000 the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were
no fees associated with these credit lines for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
NFS Contract
Effective August 1, 2021, MSCO entered into an amendment to its clearing agreement with NFS that, among other things, extends the term
of the arrangement for an additional four-year period commencing on August 1, 2021 and ending July 31, 2025. If the Company chooses to exit this
agreement before the end of the contract term, the Company is under the obligation to pay an early termination fee upon occurrence pursuant to
the table below:
Early
Date of Termination Termination Fee
Prior to August 1, 2022 $ 8,000,000
Prior to August 1, 2023 $ 7,250,000
Prior to August 1, 2024 $ 4,500,000
Prior to August 1, 2025 $ 3,250,000
For the year ended December 31, 2021, there has been no expense recognized for any early termination fees. The Company believes that it
is unlikely it will have to make material payments related to early termination fees and has not recorded any contingent liability in the financial
statements for these fees.
General Contingencies
In the normal course of its business, the Company indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers against specified potential losses in
connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the Company. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the
Company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. However, the Company believes that it is unlikely it will
have to make material payments under these arrangements and has not recorded any contingent liability in the financial statements for these
indemnifications.
The Company provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and
occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The Company may also
provide standard indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due
either to a change in or adverse application of certain tax laws. These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered
into in the normal course of business. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these
indemnifications cannot be estimated. However, the Company believes that it is unlikely it will have to make material payments under these
arrangements and has not recorded any contingent liability in the financial statements for these indemnifications.
The Company, through its affiliate, Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, LLC (“KCA”), is self-insured with respect to employee health claims. KCA
maintains stop-loss insurance for certain risks and has a health claim reinsurance limit capped at approximately $65,000 per employee as of
December 31, 2021. The estimated liability for self-insurance claims is initially recorded in the year in which the event of loss occurs and may be
subsequently adjusted based upon new information and cost estimates. Reserves for losses represent estimates of reported losses and estimates of
incurred but not reported losses based on past and current experience. Actual claims paid and settled may differ, perhaps significantly, from the
provision for losses. This adds uncertainty to the estimated reserves for losses. Accordingly, it is at least possible that the ultimate settlement of

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Executive Vice
President/Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our management,
including the Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Based on its evaluation, our management, including our Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) was identified during the
year ended December 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management does not expect that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we use the 2013 framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “2013 COSO Framework”). Using the 2013
COSO Framework, our management, including our Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our internal control over financial
reporting and concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Corporate Governance

her Board of Directors meetings and all of his or her committee meetings.
Controlled Company
We are a “Controlled Company” as defined in Rule 5615(c)(1) of the Nasdaq Stock Market because Gloria E. Gebbia and her family members
hold more than 50% of our voting power for the election of directors. As a Controlled Company we are not required to have a majority of our Board
of Directors comprised of independent directors, a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors or a nominating committee
comprised solely of independent directors.
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors currently consists of Mr. Schneider, Chairman, Mr. Zabatta and Mr. Cuttita. The Board of
Directors has determined that Mr. Schneider, Mr. Zabatta and Mr. Cuttita is each an “independent director” within the meaning of Rule 5605 (a)(2)

Siebert 2021 Form-10K 77

Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors currently consists of Mr. Zabatta and Mr. Cuttita. The Compensation Committee
reviews and determines all forms of compensation provided to our executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee will administer a
stock option and other employee benefit plans if and when adopted. The Compensation Committee does not function pursuant to a formal written
charter and as a Controlled Company we are not required to comply with the Nasdaq Stock Market’s independence requirements. The
Compensation Committee held no meetings during 2021.
The Compensation Committee will evaluate the performance of our executive officers in terms of our operating results and financial
performance and will determine their compensation in connection therewith.
In accordance with general practice in the securities industry, our executive compensation includes base salaries, an annual discretionary
cash bonus, and stock options and other equity incentives that are intended to align the financial interests of our executives with the returns to our
shareholders.
As part of its oversight of the Company’s executive compensation, the Compensation Committee will consider the impact of the Company’s
executive compensation, and the incentives created by the compensation awards that it administers, on the Company’s risk profile. In addition, the
Compensation Committee will review the Company’s compensation policies and procedures, including the incentives that they create and factors
that may reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking, to determine whether they present a significant risk to the Company.
Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors
The Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors currently consists of Mr. Zabatta and Mr. Cuttita. The Nominating Committee does not
function pursuant to a formal written charter and as a Controlled Company we are not required to comply with the Nasdaq Stock Market’s
independence requirements. The Nominating Committee did not meet in 2021.
The purpose of the Nominating Committee is to identify individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors and to
recommend to the Board of Directors or the shareholders that such individuals be selected for directorship. In identifying and evaluating nominees
for director, the Nominating Committee considers each candidate’s experience, integrity, background and skills as well as other qualities that the
candidate may possess and factors that the candidate may be able to bring to the Board of Directors. We do not have a formal policy with regard to
the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. However, the Board of Directors believes that it is essential that its members
represent diverse viewpoints, with a broad array of experiences, professions, skills, geographic representation and backgrounds that, when
considered as a group, provide a sufficient mix of perspectives to allow the Board of Directors to best fulfill its responsibilities to the long-term
interests of our shareholders.
The Nominating Committee will consider shareholder nominees for election to our Board of Directors. In evaluating such nominees, the
Nominating Committee will use the same selection criteria the Nominating Committee uses to evaluate other potential nominees.
Indemnification of Officers and Directors
We are parties to indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors and indemnify them to the extent permitted by
applicable law against liabilities incurred as a result of their service to us and against liabilities incurred as a result of their service as directors of

International Group, Inc., in the annual aggregate amount of $5 million. As to reimbursements by the insurer of our indemnification expenses, the
policy has a $250,000 deductible; there is no deductible for covered liabilities of individual directors and officers.

directors attended the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.
Siebert 2021 Form-10K 78

Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer,
Controller, Principal Accounting Officer, and any of our other employees performing similar functions. A copy of the Code of Ethics for Senior
Financial Officers is available on our website at www.siebert.com/company/investor-relations/shareholder-information.
Board Leadership Structure and Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors does not have a chairman nor a lead independent director. The Company believes this structure allows all of the
directors to participate in the full range of the Board of Director’s responsibilities with respect to its oversight of the Company’s management. The
Board of Directors has determined that this leadership structure is appropriate given the size of the Company, the number of directors overseeing
the Company, and the Board of Directors’ oversight responsibilities.
The Board of Directors intends to hold at least four regular meetings each year to consider and address matters involving the Company. The
Board of Directors also may hold special meetings to address matters arising between regular meetings. These meetings may take place in person
or by telephone. The independent directors also regularly meet in executive sessions outside the presence of management. The Board of Directors
has access to legal counsel for consultation concerning any issues that may occur during or between regularly scheduled Board meetings. As
discussed above, the Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee to assist the Board in
performing its oversight responsibilities.
Board of Directors’ Role in Risk Oversight
Consistent with its responsibility for oversight of the Company, the Board of Directors, among other things, oversees risk management of
the Company’s business affairs directly and through the committee structure that it has established. The principal risks associated with the
Company are risks related to securities market volatility and the securities industry, lower price levels in the securities markets, intense
competition in the brokerage industry, extensive government regulation, net capital requirements, customers’ failure to pay, an increase in volume
on our systems or other events which could cause them to malfunction, reliance on information processing and communications systems, continuing
changes in technology, dependence on the ability to attract and retain key personnel, the ability of our principal shareholder to control many key
decisions and there may be a limited public market for our Common Stock, among other risks and uncertainties detailed in under Part I, Item 1A -
Risk Factors of this Form 10-K as well as in our filings with the SEC.
The Board of Directors’ role in the Company’s risk oversight process includes regular reports from senior management on areas of material
risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risks. The full Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee) receives these reports from management to identify and discuss such risks.
The Board of Directors periodically reviews with management its strategies, techniques, policies and procedures designed to manage these
risks. Under the overall supervision of the Board of Directors, management has implemented a variety of processes, procedures and controls to
address these risks.
The Board of Directors requires management to report to the full Board of Directors on a variety of matters at regular meetings of the Board
of Directors and on an as-needed basis, including the performance and operations of the Company and other matters relating to risk management.
The Audit Committee also receives reports from the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm on internal control and financial
reporting matters. These reviews are conducted in conjunction with the Board of Directors’ risk oversight function and enable the Board of
Directors to review and assess any material risks facing Siebert.
10b5-1 Plans
Andrew H. Reich, Gloria E. Gebbia, Charles Zabatta, Francis V. Cuttita, and certain employees of Siebert entered into 10b5-1 plans in
September 2021.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
