PART I
Item 1. Business.
Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Registrant” or “the Company” refer to ZIVO Bioscience, Inc.., a Nevada
corporation, and its subsidiaries.
General
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1983, under the name of “L. Peck
Enterprises, Inc.” On May 27, 1999, we changed our name to “Western Glory Hole, Inc.” From 1990 until
October 2003, we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking
profitable business opportunities. On October 30, 2003, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of
Health Enhancement Corporation (“HEC”) in exchange for 9,000,000 of our shares, making HEC our wholly-
owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name to Health Enhancement
Products, Inc. On October 14, 2014, at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, a proposal
was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products, Inc. to ZIVO
Bioscience, Inc. (“ZIVO”). On October 30, 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
approved the name ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective
November 10, 2014.
We acquired HEC in 2003 because we believed its unique and complex algal culture produced natural
bioactive compounds that promoted health benefits. A production facility based in Scottsdale, AZ produced
and marketed a liquid dietary supplement with marginal success beginning in 2003 until sales were
suspended in January of 2012.
Our new management team, in place since December 2011, determined the sole focus for the near term was
to move forward with a research-based product development program. From 2012 through 2019, we have
engaged fully in such activities, all as more fully explained herein. We hold significant intellectual property
in the form of bioactive compounds, patented applications and processes, an optimized algal strain,
nutritional products and applications derived from our proprietary algal biomass that can find their way into
food, feed, supplements and therapeutics.
From the start of 2017 and moving into 2020, we have been conducting the final phase of validation for a
discovery-stage bovine mastitis treatment, consisting of in vitro and in vivo studies, which is intended to
dovetail with analytics and characterization of bioactive compounds produced by the algae itself. This body
of work will be submitted to Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS) (“Zoetis”) a global animal health company, per an
option/collaboration agreement dated December 19, 2013 and amended in 2019 (fifth amendment), to
determine if our bioactive compounds exhibit efficacy in addressing bovine mastitis, a common condition
afflicting dairy cows that results in milk production losses. Upon completion of the research, we expect to
move into negotiations regarding the option payment and subsequent licensing.
Upon the finalization of the negotiations on the aforementioned option and license agreement, we plan to
explore our options for further licensing arrangements as they relate to poultry and other livestock, canine
joint health and potentially human cholesterol management.
To that end, we expanded our research in 2018 and 2019 to include applications of bioactive molecules
originally derived from the algal culture to other animal health conditions, in poultry, canine and swine. This
effort, spread out across several research laboratories working in parallel, resulted in the successful
isolation and characterization of a novel non-starch polysaccharide with exceptional properties in
addressing immune modulation and inflammatory response for both animal and human use. A patent
application was filed at the close of 2019.
On the food and feed application side of the business, our business model anticipates deriving future income
from licensing and selling natural ingredients that may be extracted from or are initially based on our
proprietary alga1 cultures. In line with this, on April 20, 2017, we entered into a Limited License Agreement
(the “License Agreement”) with NutriQuest, LLC (“NutriQuest”) a recognized leader in animal health and
nutrition solutions. In the License Agreement, we granted to NutriQuest a limited, exclusive license to
market, distribute, sell and collect the sales proceeds in all of our nutrition, feed additive and
supplementation applications relating to naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products for oral
administration in swine and/or poultry species. As mentioned above, we affirmed human GRAS Generally
Recognized As Safe, or “GRAS” status as a plant-based ingredient in food products for human consumption.
We are in the process of garnering poultry GRAS status as a production feed ingredient and expect that
approval in late 2020. We have also entered into an Exclusive Supply Agreement (the “Exclusive Supply
Agreement”) with NutriChipz, LLC (“NutriChipz”) to supply our algae as an ingredient in chips and crisps.
Other applications available for out-licensing include spice mixes, rubs and condiments. Funding is required
to grow algae at commercial scale in order to meet compliance for animal feed ingredient and supply
NutriQuest, NutriChipz and others with product.
5

Further, we expect these new product formulations will likely be sold to much larger, well-established
animal, food, dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be
generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) bulk sales of
such ingredients. We expect bulk ingredients to be made by contracted algae growers and then sold by us to
animal food, dietary supplement and food processors and/or name-brand marketers.
In January 2007, we established HEPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as our wholly owned subsidiary (“HEPI
Pharma”). The purpose of HEPI Pharma was to develop potential pharmaceutical applications for the
bioactive ingredients that may be derived from our algae cultures.
In February 2013, we formed ZIVO Biologic, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ZIVO Biologic”), for the purpose
of manufacturing and commercialization of proprietary ingredients for non-medicinal animal health
applications. ZIVO Biologic is 100% owned by ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. ZIVO Biologic is not currently
conducting any operating activities.
In August 2013, we acquired the assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property rights, of Wellness
Indicators, Inc. (“Wellness”), a Michigan corporation based in Illinois. Concurrently, we formed WellMetris,
LLC as a 100% owned entity of ZIVO. In 2018, we changed the name of WellMetris, LLC to Wellmetrix, LLC
(“Wellmetrix”). We acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction, in addition to engineering
drawings, prototypes, chemical formulae, validation data, laboratory equipment and IT equipment. We
assigned all of the intellectual property acquired to Wellmetrix with a stated value of $1,391,281.
The mission of Wellmetrix is to develop, manufacture, market and sell Wellness Tests. The Wellness Tests
are intended to provide individuals the information and opportunity to optimize their health and identify
future health risks or to provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers with timely information to
intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. During the period of
time we have owned Wellmetrix, we have drafted and filed an additional fifteen patent applications around
the intellectual property acquired, as noted in the section “Patents and Proprietary Rights.” In the summer
of 2014, we evaluated the circumstances related to the original four patent applications acquired and
determined that two of the existing patent applications could be improved and filed new patents
applications to redefine and better protect our intellectual property. We have abandoned one of the initial
four patent applications purchased, released two of the four applications purchased and substituted them
with two new patent applications, and retained ownership of one of the four applications purchased, which
has now converted to a national phase application. In connection with the abandoned patents, we have
protected our rights with regards to the original patent applications purchased, however we determined we
should record a loss on abandonment of $1,391,281 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as the initial
value of the acquired patent applications pending resides in the newly drafted and filed eight patent
applications. On December 25, 2018 the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued Patent No.
10,161,928 – Wellness Panel, effectively securing the core conceptual premise of the Wellmetrix technology
platform.
2019 Highlights
The most significant development in 2019 was the isolation and description of a novel polysaccharide with
immune modulating and anti-inflammatory properties. We believe it is responsible for some of the various
positive benefits we’ve observed in both dairy cow and poultry research studies. This molecule may
represent an entirely new class of therapeutics or medicinal products with wide-ranging applications.
Accordingly, we filed a US patent to protect the technology in December 2019.
On the biotech side of the business, which focuses on biologically active molecules initially derived from the
proprietary algal culture, we have developed a more refined strategy to define the mechanism of action for
our molecules in poultry, namely:
The direct effect on the Eimeria parasite – a global poultry health issue
The direct effect of our bioactive molecules on poultry immunity via various key immune biomarkers
Kinomics analysis currently underway involving 771 markers of immune response and metabolic
pathways
Our work with bovine mastitis continues, when funding is available to do so. At the close of 2019, we await
data and results from a study conducted earlier in the year by long-time research collaborator Dairy
Experts, based in California. This most recent study yielded a massive amount of data, which takes
considerable time and effort to compile and analyze before any results can be announced.

With respect to the agtech side of the business, which focuses on dried algal biomass and extracts thereof,
we vastly accelerated the poultry testing schedule, with 10 new studies initiated or completed in 2019,
versus 2 studies completed in each of the two previous years. Some of the notable findings include the
following:
Demonstration of beneficial effects by treating poultry drinking water with a few drops of ZIVO algal
extract added
Multiple confirmation of beneficial effects and nutritional enhancement by introducing small
amounts of dried algal biomass into poultry feed
Demonstration of improved vaccine efficiency when chicks are fed small amounts of dried algal
biomass during the vaccination process
Multiple confirmations from repeated testing that dried algal biomass boosts immune response in
broilers
Repeated demonstration that salmonella is reduced when dried algal biomass is consumed in very
small quantities
A study conducted at University of North Carolina Greensboro revealed a positive effect in poultry
microbiome
Announced results of a study that shows improvement in feed conversion ratio when dried algal
biomass is consumed by broilers at an inclusion rate of approximately
We also extended a letter of intent with Grekin Laboratories and Dr. Steven Grekin to formulate, test,
manufacture and market a suite of anti-aging and skin health supplements and food products featuring our
proprietary algal biomass, pending availability of funding. Funding is required to produce sufficient biomass
for clinical trials per the Letter of Intent executed by both parties.
We established an algae production base in India, contracting ALG India Enterprices pvt LTD (“ALG India”)
(fka Shibin), an experienced spirulina grower, to exclusively produce ZIVO algae for export to the US. ALG
India has also undertaken construction of a 25 acre facility dedicated to ZIVO algae and financed by
Swedish investors, to be completed in a phased fashion as production is scaled during the first half of 2020.
Other growers and laboratories in India are being approached. We also executed a letter of intent with
Peruvian agribusiness Alimenta to exclusively produce ZIVO algae for export to the US and EU.
The garnering GRAS status for a poultry feed ingredient is expected to be achieved in late 2020, depending
on available funding. To that end, we have completed a number of studies relating to poultry production that
support optimized animal nutrition. Our dried algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material
in the EU, and testing is planned with NutriQuest in the Czech Republic in Q2 2020.
Relating to R&D funding, 2019 saw continued but inconsistent funding, resulting in start-stop of several key
research initiatives and resulting delays in obtaining results and sharing with our prospective partners and
potential licensees. We are continuing with our research partners to conduct classical, non-GMO strain
development to improve cultivation efficiencies for our proprietary algal strain. On the pharmaceutical side,
we are continuing work on the discovery and analytics work pertinent to the bovine mastitis therapeutic
candidate, and to enter the final arm of the in vivo validation study. ZIVO has also expanded its poultry
research after a number of successful field trials. A number of key research organizations were engaged to
work on several fronts simultaneously in order to compress the timeframe and approach the tasks from
different functional and analytical perspectives. The research organizations included the National Center for
Natural Product Research at the University of Mississippi, Michigan State University School of Veterinary
Medicine, University of North Carolina – Greensboro, Iowa State University, University of Illinois, , Eurofins,
SBH Biosciences, Dairy Experts and Elicityl, among others. The achievement of our R&D goals is subject to
the availability of sufficient funding.
Marketing and Sales
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
The marketing and sale of all future products are subject to compliance with applicable regulations. Based
on the findings from ongoing research, we have approached and are continuing to approach potential
customers or licensees in the market verticals described below. The products described throughout this
document are still in the development stage and are subject to development risk. There can be no assurance
that any of the products described below will prove to be effective, or if found to be effective, will be able to
be produced in a commercially viable manner. We have affirmed human GRAS in the USA and for the EU
our dried algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material. As we continue to work on regulatory
around the world, funding is required to grow algae at commercial scale in order to accomplish
commercialization of our products.

Animal Health and Nutrition
A 2007 pilot study in dairy cows indicated that our algal culture may be effective in fending off the onset or
significantly reducing symptoms of bovine mastitis – a condition that effectively stops milk production in
affected cows. According to the National Mastitis Council, the condition affects 10% of the U.S. dairy herd
at any one time, costing producers approximately $1,100 per case. In the U.S. alone, production losses are
nearly $3 billion. Mycoplasma bovis causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal form of bovine mastitis
(an infection of the mammary gland), for which there currently is no treatment. In the cow’s udder,
mammary epithelial cells form an immunological barrier to protect the mammary gland. When bacteria or
other pathogens break through this barrier, an infection can set in, affecting quality and quantity of milk
produced. Our compounds showed promising early results for restoration of the immunological barrier in
experiments conducted in vitro, as conducted by the Principal Researcher at the University of Wisconsin -
Madison, Department of Dairy Science.
On December 20, 2013 (as amended in 2019 – fifth amendment), we entered into a Collaboration and Option
Agreement (the “Zoetis Agreement”) with Zoetis, a global animal health company, in connection with the
prevention, treatment, and management of bovine mastitis. In the Zoetis Agreement, we granted to the
counterparty an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with us. Specifically, upon completion of
the final phases of a collaborative program, and acceptance of the work product by Zoetis, the Zoetis
Agreement provides for a 90-day exclusivity period for evaluation of results, followed by a 90-day period to
exercise the option and negotiate an option payment.
With respect to livestock and poultry applications, we intend to move on three related fronts – working to
bring an algal feed ingredient to market in the United States and EU by amplifying the algae culture;
working to produce a dietary supplement or feed additive for global consumption outside the U.S.; and,
putting ourselves in a position to license the isolated bioactive molecules to a pharmaceutical or drug
development company for synthetic development as a prescribed treatment for production animal
applications. The isolated bioactive molecules form the intellectual property of interest to Zoetis. The feed
ingredient, feed additive and dietary supplement are intended for other potential collaborators along with
NutriQuest, (whose agreement covers swine and/or poultry species only). During 2019, the Company
elected to focus its limited resources on poultry applications as they represent the nearest term revenue
opportunities.
A 2008 pilot study in dogs indicated that our algal culture may be effective in relieving the symptoms of
osteoarthritis and soreness from overexertion. That same experiment with our amplified algae culture can
be repeated in dogs, which if successful could allow a relatively rapid release to production and sales as a
companion animal dietary supplement. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, the canine joint-health
dietary supplement market segment tops $360 million annually in the U.S. alone. Estimates for the world
market may be substantially higher, but such estimates are difficult to obtain. An in vitro tissue explant
experiment conducted by the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory at University of Missouri in 2016 found
that direct stimulation of living canine joint tissue with our bioactive compounds protected cartilage from
degradation by IL-1b, an inflammatory cytokine. If our product is proven to be effective in vivo and can be
produced on an efficient basis, we intend to sell or license our product as a supplement ingredient to larger,
well-established and profitable brand names in the pet industry. We have conducted other laboratory
studies simulating the effects of canine osteoarthritis with generally positive results. All of this work has
been put on hold pending the availability of additional funding.
With all of the above, the isolated bioactive molecules found in the amplified algae product may, subject to
successful negotiations, be licensed to a pharmaceutical company for development as a synthetic
prescription drug. We expect that the process of developing and testing such a drug could take years.
Therefore, as is common practice, we intend to work toward negotiating an upfront discovery-stage
licensing fee, milestone payments upon each successful conclusion of a developmental phase, followed by
pre-market approval; and finally, a steady stream of royalties in the future. The other revenue streams are
generated by feed and supplement sales which may begin to be realized in 2020, but no assurance can be
provided in that regard. Much of the research and licensing progress has been and will continue to be paced
by the availability of capital funding and/or debt financing (see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Liquidity and Capital Resources).
In April 2017, we entered into the License Agreement with animal health innovator NutriQuest, which
provides nutritional services to the biggest brand names in US poultry and pork production. We have
completed a number of “pen” studies (pen studies are controlled testing of our ZIVO Algae to groups of
incubator chicks ranging in size from 1,000 chicks to 25,000 chicks, ultimately up to 1 million chicks -
“broilers”). In the U.S., broilers consume more than 61 billion pounds of feed annually. The U.S. is the third-
largest poultry producing nation. Phytogenic or plant-based ingredients like ours constitute the fastest-
growing segment of the global poultry feed industry, currently generating about $780 million in sales
annually, and growing at 8% annually. We are well-positioned to take market share if we meet expected
market pricing parameters.

Functional Food Ingredient - Human
According to NutraIngredients-USA, functional foods, or health foods, represent an estimated $20 billion
business in the U.S. and a $28 billion business in Europe. The Middle East, although significantly smaller, is
growing at a rate of 12-14% annually, followed closely by the newly affluent in China and India. These foods
typically are processed products that contain one or more staple foods augmented with a variety of
performance-enhancing ingredients.
We entered into the Exclusive Supply Agreement in 2018 to supply the ZIVO Algae to NutriChipz to gain a
presence in the functional food market. As we move forward into 2020, we plan to work with other suppliers
in the functional food market vertical as our algae supply expands, having engaged The Mansour Companies
as brokers for sports nutrition market verticals, and HISCO as marketing representatives for functional food
ingredients in the EU and US. Additional funding is required to grow algae at commercial scale in order to
supply NutriChipz, The Mansour Companies and others with product.
Dietary Supplement & Nutraceutical - Human
The success of spirulina, dried kelp, Omega-3 fish oil, resveratrol, saw palmetto and similar supplements
attests to the American public’s obsession with ‘natural’ products. The dietary supplement business is a $24
billion industry in the U.S. alone, and twice that the world over.
Rather than attempting to market as a branded nutraceutical or supplement, we will endeavor to private-
label the compound or finished product for larger, well-established marketers and retailers. If we are able to
accomplish this, we believe this is a more efficient use of capital and resources, while still retaining control
of the intellectual property, the manufacturing process and pricing power. Our goal is not to be placed in a
position where our premier product application is commodified and we must compete on price.
As an entry into this market, we have executed a letter of intent with Grekin Laboratories, directed by Dr.
Steven K. Grekin, in a joint effort to develop, test and launch an exclusive line of products designed to
address skin health and the appearance of aging through novel combinations of all-natural ingredients
featuring the ZIVO proprietary algae strain. The initial product line being readied for launch includes a
nourishing complex, fatty acid replenishment, collagen/protein mix and phytonutrient booster. Additional
funding is required to produce sufficient algal biomass for clinical trials per the Letter of Intent executed by
both parties.
Medicinal Food and Botanical Drug
Doctors prescribe medicinal foods and botanical drugs prior to, during or after various medical procedures,
including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and physical therapy. At times, medicinal foods are used
to augment the effects of prescription drugs. These medicinal foods are expensive and typically reimbursed
by health insurers. Botanical drugs can also be made available over-the- counter (OTC) after an extensive
compliance program.
We believe that this area has potential for us if we can demonstrate that various properties of the algal
extract can be isolated and produced as a medicinal food or beverage prescribed by physicians, or as an
OTC botanical drug. These sectors are both regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
Medicinal food standards are somewhat less stringent than pharmaceutical applications. Botanical drug
standards are similar to other pharmaceutical applications. Under our business model, if we are able to
produce a commercial product in these areas, we will endeavor to enter into a private-label arrangement
with a larger strategic partner to produce and distribute these product applications. Our goal is to turn over
the drug candidates at discovery stage and allow the licensee to move the drug development program
forward.
Pharmaceuticals
We believe that we may be able to pursue prescription drug applications for our product. The process for
developing a new prescription drug is costly, complex and time-consuming. It is an undertaking well beyond
our financial capabilities and one that may take several years to achieve. Our intent is to out-license the
natural molecules at discovery stage and allow the licensee to develop the Investigatory New Drug (IND)
filing and conduct subsequent safety/efficacy phases in order to bring a therapeutic product to market. If we
elect to pursue the development of a prescription drug, we will likely seek a partnership with a co-developer
that will share in the risk and expense of the initial development process, and then share in any royalties
resulting from the licensing or sale of any synthetic molecule and its homologs we are able to develop and
license.
The first such step was the execution of the bovine mastitis Collaboration and Option Agreement with
Zoetis. Part of our business plan is to execute agreements that may ultimately result in option payments,
licenses fees and royalty payments across animal and human applications, typically at the discovery stage.

Wellmetrix
Wellmetrix was formed for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling tests that we
believe will allow individuals and their care providers to optimize personal health and identify future health
risks. The information obtained will also provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers timely
information to intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. We plan
to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases:
In phase one (“Phase One”) or, alternately named Gen 1.0, we plan to develop and commercialize a
series of tests, which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic
function (collectively, the “Phase One Test”). The Phase One Test has been designed to measure
biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic
assessment from which intervention can commence, and from which metabolic syndrome can be
inferred. A patent that covers this particular combination of biomarkers was issued December 25,
2018.
In phase two (“Phase Two”) or alternately named Gen 1.5, we plan to develop and commercialize a
testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and
muscle efficiency due to changes in diet, exertion, hydration and dietary supplements in a self-
administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems.
In phase three (“Phase Three”) or alternately named Gen 2.0, we plan to develop and commercialize
additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the
metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests, in aggregate, will allow
identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be
applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available, the Company will
move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test, for which a provisional patent
application has already been filed.
We are currently in Phase One of development as described above.
We believe there is a viable market for our Wellness Tests. More than 19% of Americans are afflicted with
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. The Wellness Tests are intended to
identify pre-conditions to such illnesses. Such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce
incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset. This is critically important to large employers, insurers
and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums
or cash outlays.
The Wellmetrix technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze, report, record and manage
wellness and health data for an individual or large groups such as large employers, pension funds,
accountable care organizations, state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants, underwriters, re-
insurers and wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline
health benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups. We
were awarded a US patent for the Company’s novel Wellness Panel, which was announced in January of
2019.
Later in 2019, we attracted the attention of DSM, a Dutch multinational that adopted a global personalized
nutrition initiative and has contracted Wellmetrix to use its proprietary test platform to substantiate the
healthiness of two premier DSM functional food ingredients. This represents the first revenue opportunity
for Wellmetrix.
However, due to funding issues, the project with DSM cannot move forward, as we are obliged to furnish
certain study components at our own cost. Therefore, 2019 saw a renewed effort to either sell or fund
independently Wellmetrix and spin it out as a free-standing business.
Competition
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
Generic dietary supplements and functional food ingredients such as vitamins, Omega-3 and antioxidants
are made and marketed in a fiercely competitive, price-sensitive market environment. Recently, several
algae producers have made health claims for their proprietary algae strains, ranging from alternative
treatment for diabetes to controlling some HIV symptoms. Proprietary products offered by some marketers
are often dogged by unsubstantiated claims of product efficacy or present potential product safety issues,
which in turn draw the attention of regulators. The optimal position for a supplement and ingredient maker
is when pricing power can be exerted through well-protected intellectual property and further backed by
well-documented safety and efficacy claims.
10

We believe that our primary competition will come from innovators in food technology such as DSM-Martek,
Cognis, ConAgra, Cargill and Nestle, each of which has active M&A efforts, a large scientific staff and a
generous R&D budget to develop supplements and ingredients for a wide range of applications. However,
we intend to approach these very same competitors as potential strategic partners, in order to leverage
their specific expertise in certain food and supplement categories where a mutually beneficial relationship
can be established. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.
With respect to animal health, the companion animal dietary supplement segment, and specifically canine
joint health, is made up almost exclusively of chondroitin/glutathione supplements, which have dominated
that segment for more than a decade. This $360 million segment represents a potentially lucrative
opportunity to introduce a completely new product if we are able to demonstrate superior benefits and
produce a product at a comparable price. It is likely we will partner with an established animal health brand
name.
Further, the animal health market as it pertains to mastitis in dairy cows, and specifically feed ingredients
that exhibit beneficial properties, has been largely in the realm of yeast-based products. Only recently has
there been a focus on algae-based alternatives, as promoted by Alltech with its $200 million expansion of an
algae facility in Kentucky. In the U.S., feed ingredients cannot be promoted using any form of health claim,
and dietary supplements for production animals are, to our knowledge, non-existent due to FDA/CVM
regulation. However, outside the U.S., the use of dietary supplements is widespread, and we intend to
market our refined ingredients to a worldwide market in partnership with a global brand name.
Wellmetrix
The biomedical and biotech fields are fiercely competitive. Many of the “wellness” tests available to the
healthcare consumer or provider are not necessarily accurate nor reliable because most do not take into
account urine concentration as normalized by creatinine or specific gravity, which changes markedly
throughout the day. This normalization process is included in the Wellness Panel patent issued in December
2018. Blood-based wellness tests can be even less reliable because the biomarkers for oxidative stress and
inflammation are extremely dynamic and will often change before the blood can be tested, casting doubt on
the results.
Although we are not aware that competitors or competing products have entered the market recently, there
is no guarantee that our products will be proven to be effective and commercially viable, or that a larger,
better-financed competitor may not emerge once we begin promoting our products.
Raw Materials
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
We produce our microbial mixture using third party facilities. At the close of 2019, we continue to use the
AzCATI facility at Arizona State University to produce our microbial mixture for continued experimentation
and as a source of inoculum to seed ponds of contracted growers overseas. Our initial approach to building
a global supply chain is to approach existing spirulina algae growers. Spirulina producers can easily convert
their ponds to grow the ZIVO algae strain. This would allow us to rapidly build production capacity with
relatively low capital expense. Once a licensed grower supply chain is established, we will endeavor to build
larger scale facilities with joint venture partners in locations best suited for our proprietary algal strains.
This is intended to provide stability and consistency in the global supply.
In 2019 and into 2020, we are working with two ZIVO algae contract growers in India. We also have a Letter
of Intent with a grower in Peru and anticipate approval from that Government to import our ZIVO Algae
strain into Peru in the second quarter of 2020. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other
areas of the world, including Thailand, Viet Nam and Indonesia
Wellmetrix
In tandem with seeking regulatory approval, we will need two physical components to deliver our services.
A dedicated, custom reader device and a test comprised of eight (8) different chemistry tests on a single
urine test panel housed in a proprietary disposable cartridge.
The dedicated, custom reader device is manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not
believe that there is a risk of supply, as there are several manufacturers available to produce the unit.
The test panel and proprietary cartridge are manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not

Dependence on Customers
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
As discussed above, we reoriented the business model to focus on research and development in order to
license our product and technology to third parties and to furnish algal biomass in bulk. Our potential
customers are larger, well-established brand names in nutrition and health who will likely combine our algal
biomass with other ingredients for feed, food and beverage applications. At this time, there are no
customers providing any revenue.
Wellmetrix
Wellmetrix products will initially be private-labeled to established brand-names in the personal health
space. Several such brand names have been approached, however, due to funding issues, this initiative has
been placed on hold for the near term.
Production
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
As discussed above in the section titled “Raw Materials”, we produce our microbial mixture using third
party laboratory facilities. We are producing ZIVO algae at contract growers in India. We have Letters of
Intent to produce our ZIVO Algae in Peru upon in-country Government approval to import the ZIVO Algae
strain. We are actively pursuing other algae producers in other areas of the world.
Wellmetrix
As discussed above, we are using third parties to manufacture our custom reader device and test panel,
which we are currently using for development purposes.

Regulation
ZIVO Algal Products & Derivatives
General Regulatory Framework
In the United States and in any foreign market we may choose to enter, our products are subject to
extensive governmental regulations.
In the United States, these laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels
and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. The majority of these regulations directly relate to
(1) the formulation, clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our
products and (2) product claims and advertising, including claims and advertising by us, as well as claims
and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible.
U.S. product classification
In the U.S., the formulation, testing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising,
distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, primarily
the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of
the states and localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, promoted,
distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of
conventional foods, dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (or nutraceuticals).
The FDA is responsible for the oversight of all foods (including dietary supplements), drugs, cosmetics and
medical devices in the United States. To the extent that we manufacture finished products for sale to
consumers (and in certain other limited circumstances where we sell our product as an ingredient), FDA
regulations require us to comply with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations for the
preparation, packing and storage of dietary supplements. This is a complex series of regulations that have
posed significant compliance challenges to the supplement industry. To the extent that we supply our
products as ingredients for the use in foods or nutraceuticals, we would be required to comply with cGMP
regulations for foods, as well as the provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 which require
all companies involved in the production of food and food ingredients to develop and implement a Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point program.
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by recognizing “dietary supplements” as a distinct category of food and, we
believe, is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. The legislation grandfathered, with some
limitations, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994. A dietary supplement that
contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before October 15, 1994 will require evidence of a
history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe. To the extent
that we offer for sale unique, proprietary ingredients we will be required to file with the FDA evidence
supporting the conclusion that we have a “reasonable expectation” that they will be safe for human
consumption when used as directed. The FDA recently published an “Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking” which the nutraceutical industry believes will substantially increase the level of evidence
required to satisfy the “reasonable expectation” standard.
18

DSHEA provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements. DSHEA permits
substantiated, truthful and non- misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as
statements describing general well-being from consumption of a nutraceutical ingredient or the role of a
nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining structure or function of the body. A company
making a statement of nutritional support must possess adequate substantiating scientific evidence for the
statement, disclose on the label that the FDA has not reviewed the statement and that the product is not
intended to mitigate, treat, cure or prevent disease, and notify the FDA of the statement within 30 days after
its initial use. To the extent we produce finished product for use by consumers as nutraceuticals, we will be
required to comply with these provisions of DSHEA.
Labeling and advertising regulations
We may market one or more of our products as a conventional food or for use as an ingredient in
conventional foods. Within the U.S., this category of products is subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and
Education Act (“NLEA”) and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims,
ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The
ingredients added to conventional foods must either be GRAS or be approved as food additives under FDA
regulations.
The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of our product, has for years instituted
enforcement actions against companies marketing supplements for alleged false, misleading or
unsubstantiated advertising of some of their products. The FTC has specific guides for advertising claim
substantiation as well as for the use of testimonials. As a general matter, companies making health related
claims for their products or ingredients are required to possess well designed human clinical studies
supporting such claims at the time they are made. Enforcement actions have often resulted in consent
decrees and significant monetary payments by the companies involved. In addition, the FTC has increased
its scrutiny of the use of testimonials which we have and may in the future utilize.
International regulations of our products
In many foreign markets in which we may choose to offer our products for sale, we may be required to
obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable
agency. This would hold true for jurisdictions such as Canada, the European Union, Japan, Australia and
New Zealand. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to
appropriate regulators for review of data supporting safety as well as substantiating any claims we may
desire to make. We would also be required to comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that
vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations could prevent our products from
being legally offered for sale.
California Proposition 65
California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as Proposition 65, provides
that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the
state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or into land where such chemical passes or
probably will pass into any source of drinking water, without first giving clear and reasonable warning.
Among other things, the statute covers all consumer goods (including foods) sold in the State of California.
Proposition 65 allows private enforcement actions (sometimes called “bounty hunter” actions). While we
intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that any of our products that we may market will be in
compliance with the Act, given the nature of this statute and the extremely low tolerance limits it
establishes (well below federal requirements), there is a risk that we, our contracted producer or a licensee
could be found liable for the presence of miniscule amounts of a prohibited chemical in our product. Such
liability could be significant.
General
To the extent dictated by our research partners, we will continue to produce research-only feedstock for
chemical analysis, safety studies and efficacy studies compliant with applicable state and federal
regulations. However, we will rely on our research partners to conduct their respective R&D programs in a
manner compliant with applicable regulation and law. Once a product concept has been fully developed, we
intend to manufacture that product, either internally or on a contract basis. We intend to adhere to all state
and federal food safety and food manufacturing regulations for applicable product categories, and to
produce our algal biomass in compliance with standards set forth in our GRAS dossier. In either case, we
intend to adhere to all state and federal regulations relative to the safety and efficacy of the product
application, as well as relevant regulations covering the safe and consistent manufacture of that product.
19

Compliance
In November 2018, we affirmed GRAS status for use as a plant-based ingredient for human consumption.
We are in the process of affirming poultry GRAS status and expect that approval in mid-2020. We have
completed a number of studies relating to the poultry production that supports good animal nutrition. These
studies are being performed in conjunction with our licensing partner, NutriQuest, a global innovator in
animal nutrition. In the EU, the ZIVO algal biomass has been classified as an animal feed material and
testing in the EU has commenced. With appropriate funding, we can move forward with human food
ingredient compliance in 2020 utilizing all or most of the US FDA GRAS dossier.
Wellmetrix
We have worked to make the Wellmetrix testing systems compliant with existing FDA regulations and to
that end retained FDA counsel and a medical device consulting firm, which have advised us as to the most
time and cost-efficient path to classification and approvals. This activity will be reactivated upon availability
of additional funding.
Research and Development
ZIVO Bioscience, Inc.
Research
Our algal culture has been subjected to product testing in its original form over several years, beginning in
2004. In spring of 2009, we undertook a research and development process with a view to fractioning the
existing product into much smaller, concentrated groups of molecules with similar physical properties.
These groups were then tested in vivo and in vitro with successful results noted in maintaining healthy
cholesterol levels. A patent application describing a novel method of cholesterol regulation was submitted to
the USPTO in spring of 2010 and a PCT filing was submitted in February of 2011.
Since January 2012, we continue to develop our research programs internally and direct outside academic
researchers, private laboratories or contract research organizations to conduct experiments, tests and
studies on our behalf. We spent approximately $2,206,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 on
research and development, as compared to $2,798,000 in 2018. The resources were spent on external
research, mainly to independent facilities involved in the analysis and validation of our bioactive compounds
in various applications and animal models. To date, all of these amounts have been directly expensed as they
have been incurred.
Beginning in March 2016, the Company moved forward with the following R&D initiatives
Continuing a large-scale bovine mastitis study utilizing samples validated in vitro by the principal
researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and further validated in vivo by other
researchers in the fall of 2016. The pre-pilot and pilot arms of this study have been completed. The
primary arm of the study was delayed in 2018 due to inconsistencies in the testing sample,
availability of research facilities, and delays in the analytical process. The primary study arm or a
portion thereof is expected to commence in Q1 2019. The analytical work that must occur in tandem
required the addition of new research resources in order to complete such work in a timely manner.
A study utilizing cadaver cartilage and joint tissue at the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory
located at the University of Missouri showed positive early results for protective effects in canine
joint health, using our natural bioactive compounds. The study will be repeated and expanded when
capital funding is made available.
A canine whole blood experiment was conducted at an international contract research organization
to study the effects of our natural bioactive compounds on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
present in blood to assess whether a systemic or localized mechanism of action can be determined.
Although the results trended in a positive direction, Company principals determined that a more
definitive in vivo study would be more useful. Such study is expected to be conducted when capital
funding is available.
The ongoing elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds had undergone a
data integrity review in early 2014. Further work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of
the bioactives had been placed on hold since spring of 2014 pending available funding. In mid-March
2016, the Company re-activated the elucidation and characterization as funding became available.
Several university and privater laboratories were contracted to conduct isolation, and fractionation,
followed by bioassays or in vivo studies to validate the bioactivity of the purified and isolated
samples, with work ongoing at the close of 2019.
20

Beginning in spring 2017, we contracted with the National Center for Natural Products Research at
the University of Mississippi, the Boston Institute of Biotechnology, the Donald Danforth Plant
Science Center, Elicityl SA, and other research facilities to accelerate the elucidation and
characterization of the bioactive compounds present in the algal biomass, with the intent to converge
these findings with the in vivo validation conducted for treatment of bovine mastitis, and present this
body of work to Zoetis and effectively start the clock on the 90-day evaluation period. Such work
resulted in the characterization of numerous bioactive compounds, which requires additional
screening and validation to separate bioactives pertinent to bovine mastitis from those pertinent to
other human and animal models.
Beginning in fall 2016, we commenced a significant number of tests to determine the nutritional
composition of the algal biomass, its toxicity, genetic mutagenicity, bacterial count and other safety
measures for successive batches of biomass produced at AzCATI and other producers to establish
consistent production and repeatability in anticipation of GRAS approvals. These tests form the basis
for safety and stability claims as part of the requirement to meet GRAS standards applicable to both
human and poultry uses.
As mentioned previously, 2019 saw a decrease in R&D spending and the active recruitment of algae
growers in India and Peru, as well as other parts of the world. We engaged an outside consultant to
advise us on outsourcing algae production and to develop our internal and external organizational
structures to support a global supply chain in anticipation of a market launch in early 2020 pending
availability of biomass from contracted growers In addition, we worked closely with our animal feed
partner NutriQuest to conduct initial trials and analyses of a potential poultry feed ingredient, with
good results. The FDA compliance effort for a poultry feed ingredient is still underway and is
expected to dovetail with product availability in mid-2020.
The purposes for these various tests and experiments are manifold: We are not only isolating bioactive
molecules, but also testing the method of isolation and then validating that the isolated molecules retain
their bioactivity across a select range of human and animal cell lines, and that these molecules exhibit no
deleterious effects before they are introduced into humans or animals during in vivo studies. We must
ensure that this does not occur occasionally, it is required for every production process, every safety
validation process and every intended application, such as a canine dietary supplement that is mixed with
food, as opposed to a canine dietary supplement that is administered in the form of a chewable caplet.
As of late 2019, as we enter production scale-up, we are required to provide cGMP protocols and Quality
Assurance (“QA”) protocols that show we can produce the algal biomass and/or the active ingredients safely,
consistently and in defined quantities, and therefore rely on these same experiments and methods to
substantiate our quality claims. These datasets form the basis for establishing the value of a license
agreement. Therefore, every single license that we hope to issue requires its own data set and safety
validation for the specific application being licensed. These datasets represent the core of the intellectual
property that is being licensed.
Status of Culturing and Production
Independent of identifying the bioactive compound(s) or validating their bioactivity and safety is the process
and method of growing and maintaining the algal culture that gives rise to various nutritional and bioactive
compound(s) in the first place. This culture and its growing environment were developed decades ago.
However, the method was not commercially viable, and the Company has expended considerable resources
to develop a single-species, high-volume and commercially viable production methodology.
We made the decision to spread product development risk, resulting in the creation of a product platform
strategy whereby four different forms could be developed for future marketing across several categories
and applications:
a) the raw algae biomass, which would naturally contain various nutritional and beneficial
compounds;
b) a more refined extraction which could be introduced into animal feed or supplements;
c) the isolated natural molecule(s) which could be more appropriate for human consumption in food
or supplements; and
d) the synthetic version of any such natural molecule(s) which could be licensed to drug development
companies or joint-ventured in a risk-sharing arrangement.
21

To that end, we contracted with several experts in the field to coordinate isolation of the different organisms
present in the culture, grow each of them separately and then subject them to the same life-cycle stressors
as the original culture. The stated goal was to grow algae in bulk as a direct source of micro-nutrition and
feed ingredient for production animals, namely poultry, beef cattle and dairy cows, as well as companion
animal dietary supplementation. The production capability would be licensed or contracted to others. Per
the business model, we have no intention of fielding a finished product, but rather coordinating licensees
and entering into supply agreements with larger, better-financed brand names or licensing directly with
such brand names. There can be no assurance that commercially viable products will be developed, or that
they can be successfully and profitably manufactured and marketed.
Over the last several years, our contracted researchers were able to successfully isolate one or more algal
species, scale up the production/output of the isolated species and still retain some of the key, desirable
bioactive properties associated with the earlier, complex culture. Proof of concept growing techniques,
including both pond and bioreactor modes, showed that our target algal specie can be grown in
commercially viable quantities, and the harvest time was compressed from several weeks to several days’
time. We are uncertain if we can grow biomass in sufficient tonnage for livestock feed, but we believe that
the current production methods will allow us to satisfy demand for a more refined product introduced into
animal feed and into human supplements as global production capacity ramps up.
In 2018, we updated Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) in order to draft contractual terms with
contract growers domestically and abroad. The SOPs form the basis for current Good Manufacturing
Practice (“cGMP”) protocols to which contract growers and processors must adhere as part of the FDA’s
updated Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 requirements, regardless of country of origin. We
conducted experiments in post-processing, such as spray-drying centrifugal water extraction and other
techniques to better understand feed and food handling requirements. We contracted the Burdock Group of
Orlando, Florida in summer of 2016 to manage the compliance process on our behalf and we affirmed GRAS
self-affirmation in November 2018.
Looking Forward
A significant portion of our research efforts have been directed towards identifying a candidate “class of
compound” and one or more “active ingredients,” as it relates to autoimmune and anti-inflammatory
response. These are very broad categories and work is still required to fully describe the 3D structure of
such compounds to fully realize their potential licensing value. One approach among several we’ve taken is
to create synthetic homologs, and from them deduce the composition and 3D structure of the naturally
bioactive compounds.
Subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we estimate that we will, in fiscal 2020, be required to
expend in excess of $5,000,000 on research and subsequent product development and manufacturing in
order to complete the initiatives discussed herein. In addition to the activity in 2020, we plan to continue
our research and development efforts as well as manufacturing feed and food products in 2020 and beyond.
These expenditures will need to be met from external funding sources as well as revenues we intend to
receive. In the past, we have had difficulty raising funds from external sources. Thus, we may not be able to
raise the funding required to continue our research and development activities. In the event that these
sources are not available or adequate to meet our research needs, we will be unable to pursue our research
activities, in which case our ability to substantiate the accumulated intellectual property with objective
clinical support for its characterization, method of action and efficacy will continue to be impeded, thereby
severely hindering our ability to generate licensing revenue (or otherwise commercialize our products) and
adversely affect our operating results.
In the event that we are successful in raising the necessary capital, we will continue our current research
program with our research partners, we will expand our investigations to include various experts and
consultants on an as-needed basis and explore new product concepts and applications. Our current
contracts with our research partners cover the following activities:
Ongoing isolation and characterization of individual natural molecules from various production
formats in sufficient quantities for downstream analyses, experiments, standards development,
compliance, cGMP and QA protocols, whether as the basis for feed or food applications, as a lead
compound for a synthetic therapeutic, or as a medical food or botanical drug
Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro to substantiate efficacy and safety for each specific
application or claim, i.e., bovine mastitis, poultry nutrition, health, canine osteoarthritis, canine joint
health, porcine respiratory/reproductive syndrome, etc., to boost value for each specific license or
market vertical
Synthetic development/validation of individual molecules to boost value of licenses, likely to be
conducted by others, either as licensees or joint ventures
Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro for standards development, FDA safety
compliance, cGMP and QA protocols
22

Product development initiatives such as the joint development project with NutriQuest to develop a
successful poultry feed ingredient; the project with NutriChipz to develop products in the functional
food market; the project with Dr. Steven K. Grekin to develop skin health, with other partners, to
develop a protein enhancement ingredient for vegan drinks and smoothies as well as a human
dietary supplement formulation
All of the above activities need to continue in parallel in order to arrive at marketable products or licenses,
and our ability to undertake all such activities is subject to our receipt of additional funding. Ancillary
development activities would occur in parallel with our research partners.
Development
Wellmetrix
Wellmetrix was initially focused on large-scale, programmatic applications of its testing and reporting
platform. We are interested in supporting the intervention by wellness consultants or medical professionals
in the lifestyle choices made by individuals covered by traditional health insurance plans, retiree medical
benefits pools, employer-sponsored health initiatives and taxpayer-sponsored programs like Medicaid and
the ACA (Affordable Care Act) or its proposed replacement. These interventions, which are typically pre-
clinical, have been shown to be successful in delaying the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes or
cardiovascular problems. We believe that targeting asymptomatic individuals and focusing intervention
efforts on these individuals may have a positive result for wellness programs, and potentially lower
premiums and health claims. We spent approximately $101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 on research
and development, as compared to $17,000 in 2018. The resources were spent on external research.
At the close of 2015, the Wellmetrix product platform required additional prototype analyzers and additional
dry chemistry reagent strips and cartridges to conduct pilot programs for potential customers, and to use
the results of these pilot programs to help normalize data for the dry chemistry reagents as part of the FDA
submission package.
In early 2016 we refocused product development on self-monitoring of individual health, primarily focused
on those individuals who purchase dietary supplements, join health clubs or are otherwise actively pursuing
a healthy lifestyle. Since that time, we have redeveloped the sample collection device, the analyzer and the
mobile software application to better serve the needs of the consumer, rather than a workplace wellness
provider. In 2018, we completed CAD design of all key components, conducted finite element analysis of the
sample collection device to make sure that it functioned as intended and prepared CAD files for low-volume
tooling of key components. We successfully obtained a US patent in December 2018 for the core technology
– a multianalyte Wellness Panel, US Patent No. 10,161,928. We did not have the financial or scientific
resources to complete all aspects of the testing assay, which requires additional development before it is
ready for production, or the mobile software application, pending available funding. Estimated funding
required to successfully launch the technology is expected to reach $12 million.
In mid-2019, we entered negotiations with Dutch multinational DSM to apply Wellmetrix testing technology
to two premier functional food ingredients manufactured by DSM. A Research and Development Agreement
was entered into with DSM in the third quarter of 2019 and a large clinical trial using the Wellmetrix
Wellness Panel platform has been planned for mid-2020. As part of the contracted work, Wellmetrix is
obliged to gear up its operations to run the clinical trial and manufacture sufficient testing material and test
components to conduct the clinical trial. This will require new funding, but it does represent the first
revenue opportunity for the company and therefore efforts are focused on moving forward with this
relationship.
The company filed a trademark for “Wellmetrix” and purchased the ICANN domain www.wellmetrix.com
and www.wellmetrix-bts.com and registered “Wellmetrix” as an LLC in the state of Delaware.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with local, state, and federal environmental
laws applicable to our production and waste disposal. The cost of this compliance activity to date has not
been material and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had five full-time employees, four of whom are positioned in executive
management. In addition, we have two part-time people acting on a consulting basis in administrative roles.
We believe that our employee relations are good. No employee is represented by a union.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered
public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our consolidated financial statements which states that the
consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and further
states that our recurring losses from operations, stockholders’ deficit and inability to generate sufficient
cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern.
We are materially dependent on external sources for continued funding. Unless and until we realize
licensing and royalty revenues sufficient to cover our expenses, we will be reliant upon external sources to
fund our continued operations. We estimate that we will require approximately $6,000,000 in cash over the
next 12 months in order to fund our normal operations and to fund our research and development
initiatives. There is no guarantee that we will receive this funding. If we are unable to raise additional funds,
there will be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have 1.2 billion shares authorized for issuance. As of December 31, 2019, we had 394,688,456 shares
outstanding. We also had contractual commitments to issue 375,105,341 additional shares as of December
31, 2019, consisting of 75,950,501 common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debentures
and related accrued interest and 299,154,840 common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
options and warrants. This totals a potential 769,793,797 shares outstanding if all debentures were
converted and warrants exercised. In order to increase the authorized shares to a higher number, we would
need to amend our articles of incorporation, which would require stockholder approval. There is no
guarantee that we will be able to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to amend our articles of
incorporation to increase our authorized shares.
Our future success is dependent on our ability to establish strategic partnerships. We do not have resources
to pursue the development, manufacturing and marketing of products on our own, and we will need to rely
on third parties for some of these activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully
establish strategic partnerships.
The ability to market our product is dependent upon the completion of proven, clinical research. While we
are currently undergoing studies to further identify the active ingredients in our products, there is no
guarantee that the research will successfully achieve this goal. If our current research does not return the
results we expect, our business prospects will be materially and adversely affected.
Government regulation of our products may adversely affect sales. Nutraceutical and animal supplement
products, although not subject to FDA approval, must follow strict guidelines in terms of production and
advertising claims. Our ability to produce and successfully market our products is dependent upon adhering
to these requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable government regulations concerning the
production and marketing of our product, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, which
would have a material adverse effect on our business.
We have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may not achieve or sustain
profitability in the future. We have incurred losses in each fiscal year of our existence. We cannot assure you
that we will reach profitability in the future or at any specific time in the future or that, if and when we do
become profitable, we will sustain profitability. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to
meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, investors could lose
their investment.
Competition from current competitors and new market entrants could adversely affect us. We compete with
a wide range of established companies in a variety of different markets, all of whom have substantially
greater name recognition and resources than we do. We face or will face other specialized competitors if we
are able to expand into new vertical markets. These competitors may be more efficient and successful than
we are. If we fail to compete successfully, our operating results and financial condition will be materially
adversely affected.
24

Changes in laws and/or regulations may cause our business to suffer. The future success of our business
depends upon our ability to meet regulatory requirements for the sale of our products. Increased
enforcement of existing laws and regulations, as well as any laws, regulations, or changes that may be
adopted or implemented in the future, could limit our ability to market our products.
The loss of key employees and technical personnel or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success depends in part upon the continued
service of our senior management personnel. Our success will also depend on our future ability to attract
and retain highly qualified technical, managerial and marketing personnel. The market for qualified
personnel has historically been, and we expect that it will continue to be, intensely competitive. We cannot
assure you that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The loss of
certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual
property rights. In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the U.S. and elsewhere involving
patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to
suits alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violations of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets or other intellectual property rights. These risks have been amplified by an increase in the number
of third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. We could incur substantial costs in
prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation. Additionally, the defense or prosecution of
claims could be time-consuming and could divert our management’s attention away from the execution of
our business plan.
We cannot be certain that our products do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
Claims of alleged infringement or misappropriation could be asserted against us by third parties in the
future. We cannot be sure that we would prevail against any such asserted claim.
Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from a claim could require us to pay substantial
amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise
restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain a
license from the third patty asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms, that we would be able to
develop alternative technology on a timely basis, or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a
suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, our
affected products or technology. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our customers for third-party
intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us. An adverse determination
could also prevent us from offering our products or services to others. Infringement claims asserted with or
without merit against us may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a
result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our
customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business
and financial results. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an
adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our technology in any
subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Moreover, such infringement claims with or without
merit may harm our relationships with our existing customers and may deter others from dealing with us.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and efforts to protect them may be
costly and may substantially harm our business. Our ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. While we hold seven issued patent and pending patent
applications covering certain elements of our technology, these patents, and, more generally, existing
patent laws, may not provide adequate protection for portions of the technology that are important to our
business. In addition, our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents.
U.S. patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws offer us only limited protection and the laws of
some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Accordingly, defense of our
trademarks and proprietary technology may become an increasingly important issue as we seek to expand
our product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection than
the U.S. Policing unauthorized use of our trademarks and technology is difficult and the steps we take may
not prevent misappropriation of the trademarks or technology on which we rely. If competitors are able to
use our trademarks or technology without recourse, our ability to compete would be harmed and our
business would be materially and adversely affected.
We may elect to initiate litigation in the future to enforce or protect our proprietary rights or to determine
the validity and scope of the rights of others. That litigation may not be ultimately successful and could
result in substantial costs to us, the reduction or loss in intellectual property protection for our technology,
the diversion of our management’s attention and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.
We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you could receive
a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has
increased when you sell your shares.
25

Substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. Sales
of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could
occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impede our ability to raise capital
through the issuance of additional equity securities. We have outstanding warrants and convertible debt
that may result in substantially more outstanding shares, which could cause the price of our common stock
to decline.
Sales Risk – Wellmetrix products. We have not finished developing our products or sold any products. We
have only begun test marketing. We cannot be assured that there is a sufficient market demand for our
products. In addition, while we are actively pursuing the relationships necessary to begin manufacturing
and marketing the Wellness Tests, we have not yet finalized agreements with potential business partners,
including third-party resellers, labs or distributors of the Wellness Tests. Failure to secure these critical
alliances on reasonable terms could negatively impact us, our business and future plans.
Dependence on Manufacturers. We do not own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate,
manufacturing facilities for production of tests or devices which are critical to the successful operation of
the business. We plan to target manufacturers and to form alliances for the mass production of our
products, but we have no assurance that such alliances will be established. Furthermore, once we enter into
such relationships, we may not have sufficient long-term agreements with any third-party manufacturers to
ensure adequate supply and price controls. This may result in delays, quality control issues, additional
expenses, and failure to meet demand or other customer obligations or needs.
Failure of Manufacturers to Meet Design Specifications. The success of our products is contingent upon one
or more third parties manufacturing products according to design specifications. In practice, this is difficult
to enforce and guarantee. As a result, we may never realize the expected efficiency, quality or sensitivity of
our products and, as a result, may be required to continue research and development with another
manufacturer. If a joint venture partner or contractor fails to meet design specifications, we will experience
delays in commencing operations or delays in fulfilling orders in the future. Such delays could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition.
COVID-19 STATEMENT. The Company is carefully monitoring the effects the COVID-19 global pandemic is having on
its operations. Currently, the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company’s ability to raising capital.
Based on the nature of our operations, employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and
video conferencing. The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested,
although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down, with the
expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. However, the Company cannot make any assurances the
research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the COVID-19 situation is
resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible, although some resources have
delayed response effectiveness.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
For ZIVO, we have put in place a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and
selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures.
We expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger, better-financed animal, food,
dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated
from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) a toll on bulk sales of such
ingredients. These bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then
sold by us to animal food, dietary supplement and medical food processors and/or name-brand marketers.
Further, we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants
intended for therapeutic applications.
For Wellmetrix, we are developing, with the intention to manufacture, market, and sell tests, that we believe
will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks. We plan to develop and
commercialize such tests in three phases:
In phase one (“Phase One”) or, alternately named Gen 1.0, we plan to develop and commercialize a
series of tests, which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic
function (collectively, the “Phase One Test”). The Phase One Test is being designed to measure
biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic
assessment from which intervention can commence, and from which metabolic syndrome can be
inferred. A patent that covers this particular combination of biomarkers was issued December 25,
2018.
In phase two (“Phase Two”) or alternately named Gen 1.5, we plan to develop and commercialize a
testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and
muscle efficiency due to changes in diet, exertion, hydration and dietary supplements in a self-
administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems.
In phase three (“Phase Three”) or alternately named Gen 2.0, we plan to develop and commercialize
additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the
metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests, in aggregate, will allow
identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be
applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available, the Company will
move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test, for which a provisional patent
application has already been filed.
The Wellmetrix technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze, report, record and manage
wellness and health data for large groups such as large employers, pension funds, accountable care
organizations, state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants, underwriters, re-insurers and
wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline health
benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups.

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2,723,000 to $4,076,000 in 2019 compared
to $1,353,000 in 2018. Of this $2,723,000 increase, approximately $2,524,000 related to an increase in non-
cash expenses as noted below, leaving an increase in cash expenses of approximately $199,000. General and
administrative expenses increased in the following areas: an increase in salaries of $2,584,000, of which is
$2,636,000 is due to an award in 2019 of 29 million stock options to the CEO (a non-cash expense), an
increase in salary expenses of $75,000, offset by awards in 2018 of stock warrants to the Vice President –
Operations valued at $121,000 (a non-cash expense) and a decrease of the value of stock warrants issued to
the CFO of $6,000 (a non-cash expense), an increase in recruiting expense of $66,000 for the Vice President
of Global Operations, an increase of $55,000 in insurance expense, an increase in Wellmetrix operating
expenses of $42,000 mainly relating to a recruiting expense for the Executive Vice-President of Operations
and Product Development, an increase of $25,000 in travel expenses and an increase of $15,000 of office
expenses, offset by a reduction of $64,000 web-site development and public relations. Our increase in
related cash expenses of general and administrative expenses was due to increased activity.
Professional Fees and Consulting Expense
Professional fees and consulting expense increased approximately $7,000 to $1,969,000 in 2019 compared
to $1,962,000 in 2018. Professional fees and consulting expense increased in 2019 due to the following: an
increase of $931,000 in the use of financial consultants (of the total expense of $1,011,000 in 2019 related
to these activities, $737,000 was a non-cash expense in the forms warrants issued for services rendered)
and an increase in general legal fees of $165,000 offset by a decrease of $798,000 in the use of an
investment banking firm and investor relations (of which $620,000 of the expense in 2018 was in the form of
warrants - a non-cash expense), a decrease in Board of Director Fees of $191,000 (the decrease was in the
value of non-cash expense in the form of 2,500,000 common stock warrants valued at $192,614 in 2019
compared to $384,065 in 2018 issued for services rendered), a decrease in patent legal fees of $85,000, a
decrease of accounting fees of $14,000 and a decrease in listing and service fees of $1,000.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased approximately $508,000 to $2,307,000 in 2019 compared to
$2,815,000 in 2018 for the comparable period.
Of these expenses, approximately $2,206,000 and $2,798,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively, are costs associated with external research relating to Zivo. Subject to the availability of
funding, our research and development costs will grow as we work to complete the research in the
development of natural bioactive compounds for use as dietary supplements and food ingredients, as well as
biologics for medicinal and pharmaceutical applications in humans and animals. The Company’s scientific
efforts are focused on the metabolic aspects of oxidation and inflammation, with a parallel program to
validate and license products for healthy immune response. The decrease of $508,000 from the prior period
can be attributed to a decrease in available funding. We expect external research and development to
increase in 2020 as we pursue additional external trials, subject to the availability of sufficient funding,
which we do not currently have.
With respect to our Wellmetrix, LLC subsidiary, we incurred approximately $101,000 and $17,000 in
research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
R&D effort to date has centered on optimizing dry chemistry, developing lower-cost alternatives for the
proprietary analyzer device, negotiating and collaborating with offshore manufacturers and assembling the
FDA pre-submission package for product classification and approval. The increase of $84,000 from the prior
period is due to prioritization of Wellmetrix research.
Other Income (Expenses)
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded approximately $375,000 relating to amortization of
debt discount as compared to $903,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease $528,000. The
decrease is related to the funding expenses of the convertible debt and the valuation related to the debt
discount calculation. The discounts are amortized on a straight-line basis through April 1, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $-0- in finance costs as compared to $97,000 in
2018. The decrease of $97,000 was due to a decrease in convertible debt funding in 2019 as compared with
2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $-0- in finance costs paid in stock and warrants as
compared to $311,000 in 2018. The increase of $311,000 was due to a decrease in convertible debt funding
in 2019 as compared to 2018.
29

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded approximately $2,783,000 in interest expense as
compared to $7,194,000 in 2018, a decrease of $4,411,000. Included in interest expense is the amortization
of debt issuance costs of approximately $1,189,000 and $5,093,000, respectively. The decrease of
$4,411,000 is due to: 1) no new funding of convertible debt in 2019, 2) the conversion of $17,274,350 in
principal and interest of Convertible Debt to HEP Investments (a related party) over the course of 2019, 3)
conversion of $311,836 of Loan Payable-Related Party and accrued interest, 4) the amortization of the
remaining deferred finance costs from 2018 offset by 5) the issuance to HEP Investments a warrant to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $165,432.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared on a “going concern”
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. For the reasons discussed herein, there is a significant risk that we will be unable to continue as a
going concern, in which case, you would likely suffer a total loss of your investment in our company.
As of March 23, 2020, we had cash in the bank of $14,000. We have incurred significant net losses since
inception, including a net loss of approximately $11,427,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. We
have, since inception, consistently incurred negative cash flow from operations. During the year ended
December 31, 2019, we incurred negative cash flows from operations of approximately $3,707,000. As of
December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficiency of $8,338,483 and a stockholders’ deficiency of
$8,338,483. Although we recently raised a limited amount of capital, we have a near term need for
significant additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating activities used approximately $3,707,000 in cash,
compared with $5,007,000 in cash during the comparable prior period. The approximate $1,300,000
decrease in cash used by our operating activities was due primarily to the following (all of which are
approximated): a $3,209,000 decrease in net loss, an increase of $542,000 in cash expense offset by a
decrease in non-cash expenses of $2,451,000. The $542,000 of increase in cash expense was due to the
following: an increase of accounts payable of $1,113,000, an increase of prepaid expenses of $7,000, offset
by a decrease of $578,000 in accrued liabilities (mainly composed of the decrease in accrued interest).
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no investing activities.
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our financing activities generated $3,665,000 and
$5,078,000 in cash, respectively. The decrease of $1,413,000 was primarily related to a net increase of
proceeds of $199,000 from issuance of common stock and exercise of common stock warrants, an increase
of $250,000 in net loans from related parties, an increase in deferred finance costs of $107,000 offset by a
decrease of $1,969,000 from issuance of convertible debentures.
Although we raised a limited amount of capital during 2019, we continue to experience a shortage of capital,
which is materially and adversely affecting our ability to run our business. As noted above, we have been
largely dependent upon external sources for funding. We have in the past had difficulty in raising capital
from external sources. We are still heavily reliant upon external financing for the continuation of our
research and development program.
We estimate that we will require approximately $6,000,000 in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund
our normal operations and to fund our research and development initiatives. Based on this cash
requirement, we have a near term need for additional funding. Historically, we have had substantial
difficulty raising funds from external sources; however, we recently were able to raise a limited amount of
capital from outside sources. If we are unable to raise the required capital, we will be forced to curtail our
business operations, including our research and development activities.
COVID-19 STATEMENT
The Company is carefully monitoring the effects the COVID-19 global pandemic is having on its operations.
Currently, the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company’s ability to raising capital. Based on
the nature of our operations, employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video
conferencing. The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested,
although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down, with
the expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. However, the Company cannot make any
assurances the research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the
COVID-19 situation is resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible,
although some resources have delayed response effectiveness.
30

Seasonality
Based on our implemented business model, anticipated income streams will be generated from the
following:
a) For ZIVO, (i) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, isolated natural
compounds and synthetic variants thereof, and (ii) bulk sales of such ingredients;
b) For Wellmetrix, the (i) sale of wellness tests and data services related to medical records
management and (ii) analysis/compilation of data gathered on behalf of payers. For insurers, the
primary selling season is November through April of any given year.
We do not anticipate that these will be affected by seasonality.
Staffing
We have conducted all of our activities since inception with a minimum level of qualified staff. We currently
do not expect a significant increase in staff.
Off-Balance Sheet arrangements
We have no off-Balance Sheet arrangements that would create contingent or other forms of liability.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Not required for smaller reporting companies.
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Reference is made to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Reports thereon, and the Notes thereto,
commencing on page F-1 of this report, which Consolidated Financial Statements, Reports, Notes and data

None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Based on their evaluation as of December 31,
2019, our Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of the end of
the period covered by this report to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and instructions for Form 10-K. Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b )Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of the
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our
assessment of those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.
This Management’s report is not deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Actor
otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, unless we specifically state in a future filing that
such report is to be considered filed.
31

(c)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f)) during the year ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of
ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Consolidated financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. and subsidiaries
(the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' deficiency, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of
our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will
continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has incurred significant operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and, as of
December 31, 2019, has a significant working capital and stockholders’ deficiency. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The business model of ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. and Subsidiaries (Health Enhancement Corporation, HEPI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wellmetrix, LLC (fka WellMetris, LLC), and Zivo Biologic, Inc., (collectively the
“Company”) is as follows: 1) to derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients
derived from their proprietary algae cultures to animal, human and dietary supplement and medical food
manufacturers, and 2) developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling tests that the Company believes
will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks.
NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Going Concern
The Company had a net loss of $11,510,166 and $14,635,367 during the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2018, respectively.
In addition, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $8,338,483 and a stockholders’ deficiency of
$8,338,483 at December 31, 2019. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be
generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity
financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate
cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially
curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on
attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing
shareholders.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability or classification of asset- carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds, either in the form of
debt or equity or some combination thereof. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to
raise the additional funds it requires.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received proceeds of $2,650,000 from the issuance
of Common Stock, $982,017 from the exercise of Common Stock Warrants and $32,500 in proceeds from
loans payable – related party.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ZIVO Bioscience, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Health Enhancement Corporation, HEPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wellmetrix, LLC, and Zivo
Biologic, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results could
differ from those estimates. Management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as
warranted, solicit external professional advice and other assumptions believed to be reasonable.

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of
deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company
maintains cash and cash equivalents balances at financial institutions and are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. At times, balances in certain bank accounts may exceed the
FDIC insured limits. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less when purchased. At December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment consist of furniture and office equipment and are carried at cost less allowances for
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are determined by using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Repair and maintenance costs that do not
improve service potential or extend the economic life of an existing fixed asset are expensed as incurred.
Debt Issuance Costs
The Company follows authoritative guidance for accounting for financing costs (as amended) as it relates to
convertible debt issuance cost. These costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt period or
until redemption of the convertible debentures. Debt Issuance Costs are reported on the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the face amount of the related notes. Amortization of debt issuance costs amounted to
$1,187,817 and $5,093,001 and are included in Interest Expense and Interest Expense – Related Parties on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Unamortized Debt Issuance Costs in the amounts of $-0- and $1,187,817 are netted against Convertible
Notes Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in these financial statements as of December
31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
We will recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of
product ownership have transferred to our customers, as evidenced by the existence of an agreement,
delivery having occurred, pricing being deemed fixed, and collection being considered probable. We will
record pricing allowances, including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers, when we
recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue.
For year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no revenue.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 no
shipping and handling costs were incurred.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The majority of the Company’s research and
development costs consist of clinical study expenses. These consist of fees, charges, and related expenses
incurred in the conduct of clinical studies conducted with Company products by independent outside
contractors. External clinical studies expenses were $2,307,033 and $2,814,991 for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are
determined using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

ZIVO BIOSCIENCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities
at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to net operating loss carry forwards. Since the
Company has a history of losses, and it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized, a full valuation allowance has been established. In addition, utilization of net
operating loss carry-forwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the “change in ownership”
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
loss carry-forwards before utilization.
We have adjusted Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities in accordance with the December 22, 2017 enactment
of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (See Note 11 – Income Taxes).
Stock Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation – Stock
Compensation. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the
grant date based on the award’s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
The Company, from time to time, issues common stock or grants common stock options and warrants to its
employees, consultants and board members. At the date of grant, the Company determines the fair value of
the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period. Issuances of
common stock are valued at the closing market price on the date of issuance and the fair value of any stock
option or warrant awards is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
During 2019 and 2018, options and warrants were granted to employees, directors and consultants of the
Company. As a result of these grants, the Company recorded compensation expense of $3,605,235 and
$1,393,313 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
The fair value of options and warrants were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions:
Year Ended December 31,
2019 2018
Expected volatility 150.34% to 186.77% 176.10% to 180.13%
Expected dividends 0% 0%
Expected term 5 to 10 years 5 years
Risk free rate 1.58% to 2.55% 2.65% to 2.96%
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s
employee options and warrants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management’s opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of the warrants.
Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the Company’s net loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period presented. Diluted loss per share is based on the treasury
stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock such as shares issuable
pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants and conversions of debentures. Potentially dilutive
securities as of December 31, 2019, consisted of 73,871,688 common shares from convertible debentures
and related accrued interest and 223,204,339 common shares from outstanding options and warrants.
Potentially dilutive securities as of December 31, 2018, consisted of 232,333,598 common shares from
convertible debentures and related accrued interest and 192,148,956 common shares from outstanding
options and warrants. For 2019 and 2018, diluted and basic weighted average shares were the same, as
potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. There were no Advertising Costs during the
years 2019 and 2018.

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company has historically maintained cash balances at
financial institutions which exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit of
$250,000 at times during the year.
Reclassifications
Certain items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.
Recently Enacted Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09 superseded the revenue
recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605),” and requires entities to recognize revenue
when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflect the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that
reporting period. Historically the Company has had no revenues.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to recognize all leases, with
limited exceptions, on the balance sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain
similar to current lease accounting. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies
certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification
Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, and ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-
Scope Improvements for Lessors, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02.
The Company has adopted both of the ASUs on January 1, 2019. Prior comparative periods were not
required to be restated and the ASUs have not had an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment at December 31, 2019 and 2018 consist of the following:
December 31, December 31,

There were no depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively.
NOTE 5 – DUE TO RELATED PARTY
As of January 1, 2018, the Company owed HEP Investments, LLC, a related party $475,834 pursuant to the
terms an agreement with HEP Investments. The origin of the payable was a 5.4% cash finance fee for
monies invested in the Company in the form of convertible debt (see Note 7). During the year ended
December 31, 2018, as a result of various financings HEP Investments earned an additional $96,595 in
finance fees. In the same year the Company paid $140,000 in cash for a balance due to related party on
December 31, 2018 of $432,429.
During the year ended December 31, 2019 the company borrowed an additional $110,500 in working

NOTE 7 – CONVERTIBLE DEBT (CONTINUED)
On January 31, 2018, the Company and the Lender entered into the following documents, effective as of
January 31, 2018: (i) Ninth Amendment to Loan Agreement under which the Lender has agreed to advance
up to a total of $17,500,000 to the Company, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) a Tenth Amended and
Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. The Ninth Amendment to Loan Agreement amends
and restates the Eighth Amendment to Loan Agreement, which was entered into with the Lender on March
1, 2017 and disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K Current Report filed on March 6, 2017. The Tenth
Amended and Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note extends the maturity date for all
convertible debt due to HEP Investments to April 1, 2019, including the payment of any interest due and
owing at that time. In consideration for extending the maturity date of the Loan to April 1, 2019 in
accordance with the Tenth Amended and Restated Senior Convertible Promissory Note, the Company
agreed to issue to the Lender warrants to purchase 3,250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $.10 with a term of 5 years. The warrants were valued at $246,496 using the Black Scholes pricing model
relying on the following assumptions: volatility 175.81%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.41%.
The Company determined that the modification of these Notes was not a substantial modification in
accordance with ASC 470-50, “Modifications and Extinguishments.”
On April 12, 2018, the Lender converted $30,000 of the debt and $9,231 of accrued interest into 392,310
shares of the Company’s common stock (at $.10 per share).
On April 30, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the issuance to the Lender of a warrant to purchase 50
million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years on the basis of $4 million
funding through a combination of sales of common stock and the issuances of 11% convertible notes (at a
conversion price of $.10) to HEP Investments. This warrant is in addition to 10% warrant coverage (five-
year term) provided to the Lender in connection with investments in convertible debt pursuant to existing
agreements. A warrant for 25 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five
years was issued on June 6, 2018 as $2 million of the related $4 million funding was complete. A portion of
the warrant has a cashless exercise provision. The related issued warrants were valued at $3,116,485 using
the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 175.02%; annual rate of
dividends 0%; discount rate 2.77%. The Company recorded $2,039,448 of these costs, which represents the
amount attributable to the sale of common stock, as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital and $1,077,037
was recorded as a Debt Issuance Cost on the Company’s Balance Sheet as a direct deduction of 11%
convertible notes payable.
On May 16, 2018, the Company and the Lender, entered into the following documents, effective as of May
16, 2018: (i) Tenth Amendment to Loan Agreement under which the Lender has agreed to advance up to a
total of $20,000,000 to the Company, subject to certain conditions, and (ii) an Eleventh Amended and
Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. The Tenth Amendment to Loan Agreement amends
and restates the Ninth Amendment to Loan Agreement, which was entered into with the Lender on January
31, 2018 and disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K Current Report filed on May 18, 2018. The Eleventh
Amended and Restated Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note increased amount that the Lender can
advance to $20,000,000. In consideration for increasing the advance amount to $20,000,000 in accordance
with the Eleventh Amended and Restated Senior Convertible Promissory Note, the Company agreed to issue
to the Lender warrants to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 with a
term of 5 years. The warrants were valued at $476,464 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the
following assumptions: volatility 174.80%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.94%. The Company
determined that the modification of these Notes was not a substantial modification in accordance with ASC
470-50, “Modifications and Extinguishments.”
On June 6, 2018 the Lender and Strome Mezzanine Fund LP and Strome Alpha Fund LP (“Participant”)
entered into the First Amended and Restated Participation Agreement (amending the June 17, 2017
agreement) whereby the Participant agreed to fund a total of $691,187 (“the committed funding”), through
the Lender’s 11% convertible note (at a conversion price of $.10). The Company also agreed to a “Right of
First Refusal” (ROFR) with the Participant. The Company would give the Participant the ROFR to invest
funds into the Company on the same terms and conditions (“Right of Participation”) as negotiated by the
Company with a third party, provided that the Right of Participation must be exercised within 10 days.
Certain exclusions apply relating to the committed funding from parties unrelated to the Participant. This
ROFR terminates on the third (3) anniversary of the Agreement. The Participant has an agreement with the
Lender and the Company, that upon the funding of the Participant’s full $2 million ($1,308,813 though the
purchase of common stock from the Company and $691,187 through the purchase of HEP Investments’ 11%
convertible note (at a conversion price of $.10)), a warrant for 25 million shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years would be allocated from the warrant for 50 million shares of
common stock authorized in the April 30, 2018 Board of Directors Resolution. The total funding of $2 million
was achieved on June 6, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded debt discounts, related to $1,968,801 of
Notes in the amount of $819,854 to reflect the relative fair value of the related warrants pursuant to “FASB
ASC 470-20-30 – Debt with Conversion and Other Options: Beneficial Conversion Features” (ASC 470-20) as
a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible debt and an addition to additional paid-in capital. In
accordance with ASC 470-20, the Company valued the beneficial conversion feature and recorded the
amount of $613,758 as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible debt and as an addition to
paid-in capital. Additionally, the relative fair value of the warrants was calculated and recorded at $206,096
as a further reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible debt and an addition to additional paid-in
capital. The Company is amortizing the debt discount over the term of the debt. The relative fair value of the
debt discounts of $206,096 were calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following
assumptions: volatility 174.59% to 180.14%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.09% to 3.04% The
Company is amortizing the debt discount over the term of the debt. Amortization of the debt discounts were

On March 29, 2019, the Company and the Lender entered into a “Debt Extension Agreement” whereby the
Lender extended the maturity date of the Note to June 30, 2019. The Lender received no additional
consideration related to this debt extension. The Company determined that the modification of these Notes

accrued interest into 172,743,505 shares of the Company’s common stock (at $.10 per share).
As of December 31, 2019, the total shares of common stock, if the Lender converted the complete
$4,090,342 convertible debt, including related accrued interest of $1,522,071, would be 56,166,406 shares,
not including any future interest charges which may be converted into common stock.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not made the required annual interest payments and principal
payments to the Lender. As the Company has not received a notice of default, pursuant to the terms of the
Notes, the Company does not currently consider itself in default. Were the Company to default, additional
interest would accrue at a rate of 16% per annum.
Paulson Investment Company, LLC - Related Debt

December 31, 2016, the Company received funding of $1,250,000 through seven (7) individual loans (the

Promissory Note (“New Lenders Notes”) in the principal amount of the loan, (iii) a Security Agreement
under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in all of its assets and (iv) an Intercreditor
Agreement with HEP Investments, LLC (HEP) whereby HEP and the New Lenders agree to participate in all
collateral on a pari passu basis. The loans have a two-year term and mature in September 2018 ($600,000)
and October 2018 ($650,000). Paulson received a 10% cash finance fee for monies invested in the Company
in the form of convertible debt, along with 5 year, $.10 warrants equal to 15% of the number of common
shares for which the debt is convertible into at $.10 per share.

As it relates to the Company‘s wholly-owned subsidiary, Wellmetrix, LLC (“Wellmetrix”), if and when at least
$2 million in equity capital is raised from a third party and invested in Wellmetrix in an arms-length
transaction, Mr. Dahl shall be granted a warrant to purchase an equity interest in Wellmetrix that is equal
to the equity interest in Wellmetrix owned by the Company at the time of the first tranche of any such
capital raise (the “Wellmetrix Warrant”). The Wellmetrix Warrant shall be fully vested as of the date it is
granted and shall expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the grant date. Once granted, the Wellmetrix
Warrant may be exercised from time to time in whole or in part, with Mr. Dahl retaining any unexercised
portion. The exercise price for the Wellmetrix Warrant shall be equal to the fair market value of the interest
in Wellmetrix implied by the pricing of the first tranche of any such capital raise.

occurs and Mr. Dahl is not offered substantially equivalent employment with the successor corporation or
Mr. Dahl’s employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Agreement) during the three month
period prior to the Change of Control or the 24-month period following the Change of Control, 100% of Mr.
Dahl’s unvested options will be fully. Mr. Dahl’s Employment Agreement also provides for severance
payments of, amongst other things, 300% of base salary and 2x the amount of the Revenue Bonus in such

NOTE 9- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
As of December 31, 2019, the milestone relating to the identification of bioactive agents in the Company
product and the filing of a patent with respect thereto was met, thereby triggering the option to purchase
1,000,000 common shares. As per the Agreement, the Company issued a non-qualified option to purchase 1
million shares of the Company according to the 2019 Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $.14 with a term
of 10 years (these options were valued at $138,806 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the
following assumptions: volatility 164.37%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 1.84%).
The Company issued a non-qualified option to purchase 28 million shares of the Company according to the
2019 Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $.10 with a term of 10 years (these options were valued at
$2,497,161 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 164.20%;
annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 1.84%).
Investment Banking, M&A and Corporate Advisory Agreement
On February 21, 2018 the Company entered into a one-year agreement with an Investment Banking, Merger
and Acquisition (M&A) and Corporate Advisory firm (“Firm”). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the
Company issued a warrant to purchase 2,326,504 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a
term of five years. The warrants were valued at $245,040 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on
the following assumptions: volatility 177.09%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.69%. In addition
to the contract fee, the Company could potentially be obligated to pay up to an 8% M&A transaction fee (as
defined in the Agreement) plus a warrant to purchase shares of common stock equal to between 0.5% and
1.0%. As of December 31, 2018, the Company issued warrants to purchase 3,007,132 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $.13 with a term of 5 years to an investment banker. The warrants were valued
at $374,511 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on the following assumptions: volatility 180.13%;
annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.65%. As a result of this issuance, any further potential
obligation to pay a M&A transaction fee relating to warrants to purchase shares of common stock would be
equal to 0.5% of the post financing fully shares outstanding at an exercise price equal to the valuation /
share price of the financing (see Note 8 – Stockholders’ Deficiency).
On September 30, 2019, effective July 9, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with a Financial
Advisor. The Financial Advisor has been engaged in an exclusive arrangement in connection with the
proposed securities offering and sale of up to $35 million of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company
has agreed to pay the Financial Advisor, upon the acceptance of a successful funding transaction, a fee of
1% of the aggregate value of the transaction and a warrant to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $.10 for a term of five years. As of December 31, 2019, in connection with this
agreement, no successful funding transactions have taken place and no warrants have been issued.
Supply Chain Consulting Agreement
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into a Supply Chain Consulting Agreement with a consultant
(“Consultant”) (see Note 8 – Stockholders’ Deficiency). In May 2019, the Company issued a supplemental
warrant to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.08 for a term of five years
to the Consultant. The warrants were valued at $529,023 using the Black Scholes pricing model relying on
the following assumptions: volatility 181.49%; annual rate of dividends 0%; discount rate 2.34%. In October
2019, 2,000,000 of those warrants were returned to the Company resulting in a reduction in the value of
$211,609. On September 14, 2019, the parties entered into a First Amendment to the Supply Chain
Consulting Agreement (“Supply Consulting Agreement Amendment”). The Supply Consulting Agreement
Amendment provides that the Consultant will identify and help negotiate the terms of potential joint
ventures involving algae production development projects or related transactions or business combinations
(“Development Project”). The Supply Consulting Agreement provides for exclusivity in Southeast Asia;
Oceania; Indian subcontinent; and Africa; with regions in the Middle East by mutual agreement. The closing
of a Development Project (as acceptable to the Company) is defined as the date that the Company is able,
financially and otherwise, to proceed with engineering and construction of algae production facilities,
processing or warehousing facilities and supply chain development, or related business combinations
rendering an equivalent outcome (in the reasonable determination of the Company), for the production,
processing, transport, compliance, marketing and resale of its proprietary algae biomass. Upon the closing
of a Development Project, the Company will pay cash fees of $300,000 to Consultant, pay an on-going
monthly fee of $50,000 for 24 months and issue to Consultant a cashless warrant with a five-year term to
purchase nineteen million (19,000,000) shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.10
per share. As of December 31, 2019, the Development Project has not closed, and the warrants have not yet
been issued. The Board of Directors has also authorized the Company to issue to Consultant a cashless
warrant with a five-year term to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise
price of $0.10 per share at its discretion. As of December 31, 2019, such warrant has not been issued.

NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 2018 the Company had available net-operating loss carry-forwards for Federal tax
purposes of approximately $76,746,000, which may be applied against future taxable income, if any, at
various dates from 2019 through 2039. Certain significant changes in ownership of the Company may
restrict the future utilization of these tax loss carry-forwards.
At December 31, 2019 the Company had a deferred tax asset of approximately $20,721,000 representing the
benefit of its net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company has not recognized the tax benefit because
realization of the tax benefit is uncertain and thus a valuation allowance has been fully provided against the
deferred tax asset. The difference between the Federal and State Statutory Rate of 27% and the Company’s
effective tax rate of 0% is due to an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $3,788,000 in
2019.

COVID-19 STATEMENT
The Company is carefully monitoring the effects the COVID-19 global pandemic is having on its operations.
Currently, the main potential effect is the uncertainty of the Company’s ability to raising capital. Based on
the nature of our operations, employees are able to work remotely with access to teleconferencing and video
conferencing. The research partners utilized by the Company are currently providing services as requested,
although some University researchers have limited availability as their campuses have closed down, with
the expectation they will reopen sometime in April 2020. However, the Company cannot make any
assurances the research partners will open as expected and perform at the levels as required until the
COVID-19 situation is resolved. Other contract research organizations have remained open and accessible,
although some resources have delayed response effectiveness.
