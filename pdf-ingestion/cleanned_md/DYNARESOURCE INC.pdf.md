CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS—INFORMATION CONCERNING PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE
ESTIMATES
The Company is an “OTC Reporting Issuer” as that term is defined in BC Multilateral Instrument 51-105, Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-
Counter Markets promulgated by the British Columbia Securities Commission. In Canada, an issuer is required to provide technical information
with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its mineral exploration properties in accordance with Canadian
requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to
registration statements and reports filed by United States companies pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. As such, certain
disclosures of mineralization under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies
subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC and not subject to Canadian securities legislation.
While these terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities legislation (under National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), entitled
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the SEC does not recognize these terms. Investors in the United States are cautioned not to assume
that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, inferred mineral resources have a
great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a measured
mineral resource, indicated mineral resource or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities
legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain
circumstances, the basis of a “preliminary economic assessment” as that term is defined in NI 43-101. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume
that any part or all of any reported measured, indicated, or inferred mineral resource estimates referred to in the NI 43-101 Technical Report and
Mineral Resource Estimate (compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV) are economically or legally mineable.
Under U.S. standards, as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been
made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SJG
Property as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified as mineral
reserves have not “demonstrated economic viability.” The quantity of resources and the quality (grade) of resources reported as “Indicated” and
“Inferred” mineral resources in the mineral resource estimate compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV, under the NI 43-101 Mineral
Resource Estimate filed by the Company on SEDAR, are not disclosed in this Form 10-K. SEDAR is Canada’s System for Electronic Document
Analysis and Retrieval, the mandatory document filing and retrieval system for Canadian public companies. There has been insufficient exploration
to define any mineral reserves on the SJG Property, and it is not certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral reserves.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History and Organization
The Company is a minerals investment, management, and exploration company, and currently conducting test mining and pilot milling operations
through an operating subsidiary in México, with specific focus on precious and base metals in México. The Company was originally incorporated in
the State of California on September 28, 1937, under the name West Coast Mines, Inc. In November 1998, the Company re-domiciled from
California to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. (“DynaUSA”).
We currently own 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico, and DynaMéxico currently holds 20% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico.
DynaMéxico owns 100% of the mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which comprise the San Jose de Gracía Property (“SJG”),
in northern Sinaloa State, México. We also own 100% of Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMineras”), the exclusive operator of the San
José de Gracía Project, under contract with DynaMéxico. DynaMineras currently conducts test mining and pilot milling operations, and other
exploration activities in México. The Company also has another wholly owned subsidiary, DynaResource Operaciones, S.A. de C.V.
(“DynaOperaciones”). DynaOperaciones entered into a personnel management agreement with DynaMineras and, under the terms of that
agreement, DynaOperaciones is the exclusive management company for registered employees.
Segment Information
Our only current operating segment is DynaMéxico.
Products
The end use product produced at our test mining and pilot milling operations at SJG is in the form of gold-silver concentrates. Gold-silver
concentrates, or simply concentrate, is raw precious metals materials that has been crushed and ground finely to a sand-like product where gangue
(waste) and non-precious metals are removed or reduced, thus concentrating the precious metals component. Concentrates processed and
produced from San Jose de Gracía are shipped to third-party smelters, refineries or third parties for further processing or re-sale.
During 2020, we reported the delivery and sale of 5,828 net Oz gold contained in concentrates. All gold-silver concentrate originated from the San
Jose de Gracía Property in México.
Gold-silver concentrates are sold at a small discount to the prevailing spot market price, based on the price per ounce of gold and silver quoted at
the London PM fix, with the actual net precious metals prices received depending on the sales contract. Concentrates are priced by individual
concentrate lots of 36 to 72 tons, or as a series of lots under contract, whereby the final selling price and gold-silver quantities are subject to final
adjustments at the time of final purchase settlement.
Gold and Silver Pilot Processing Methods
Gold and silver are extracted from mined mineralized material, by crushing, grinding, milling, and further by simple gravity and flotation
recoveries. The mineralized material is extracted by underground mining methods. The processing plant at the San José de Gracía mine is
composed of conventional crushing and grinding circuits, and with gravity and flotation recovery methods. The gravity and flotation concentrates
are dewatered and shipped to purchasers in semi-truck trailers.
Gold and Silver Reserves / No Known Reserves
The Company currently has no mineral “reserves” as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the SEC.

General Government Regulations
México
Mining in México is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances governing mineral rights, operations and
environmental protection.
Mineral Concession Rights. Exploration and exploitation of minerals in México may be carried out through Mexican companies incorporated
under Mexican law by means of obtaining mining concessions. Mining concessions are granted by the Mexican government for a period of fifty
years from the date of their recording in the Public Registry of Mining and are renewable for a further period of fifty years upon application within
five years prior to the expiration of such concession in accordance with the Mining Law and its regulations. Mining concessions are subject to
annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi-annual basis. Such concessions may be
transferred or assigned by their holders, but such transfers or assignments must be registered with the Public Registry of Mining in order to be
valid against third parties. The holder of a concession must pay semi-annual duties in January and July of each year on a per hectare basis and in
accordance with the amounts provided by the Federal Fees Law. During the month of May of each year, the concessionaire must file with the
General Bureau of Mines, the work assessment reports made on each concession or group of concessions for the preceding calendar year. The
regulations of the Mining Law provide tables containing the minimum investment amounts that must be made on a concession. This amount is
updated annually in accordance with the changes in the Consumer Price Index.
Surface Rights. In México, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, Ejidos
(communal owners of land recognized by the federal laws in México) control surface access rights to the land. An Ejido may sell or lease lands
directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the Ejido that impact all of its
projects in México, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiations.
Mining Royalties. In October 2013, the Mexican lower house passed a bill levying a tax-deductible mining royalty of 7.5% on earnings before the
deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, along with an additional 0.5% surcharge on precious metals revenue for mining
companies. The effective date of the law was January 1, 2014. Although there are a few uncertainties surrounding the scope, calculation and
enforcement of the royalty, based on the Company's current interpretation of the bill, the royalty or surcharge was not material for 2020.
Environmental Law. The Environmental Law in México, called the "General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection to the Environment"
("General Law"), provides for general environmental policies, with specific requirements for certain activities such as exploration set forth in
regulations called "Mexican official norms". Responsibility for enforcement of the General Law, the regulations and the Mexican official norms is
with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, which regulate all environmental matters with the assistance of Procuraduria Federal de
Protección al Ambiente (known as "PROFEPA").
2020 Forestry Law. The 2020 Forestry Law provides for general policies for the use and protection of the surface, and for plants, soil and trees. The
regulation of the Forestry Law is with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, with the assistance of PROFEPA.
Residues Law. The Residues Law, also known as Norm 141, provides for general policies for the deposit and storage of residue and waste. The
regulation of the Residues Law is with the Ministry Of Environment and Natural Resources, with the assistance of PROFEPA.
The primary laws and regulations used by the State of Sinaloa, where our San Jose de Gracía property is located, in order to govern environmental
protection for mining and exploration are: The General Law, the 2020 Forestry Law, Residues Law, as well as their specific regulations on air,
water and residues, and the Mexican official norms (known as "NOM-120"). In order to comply with the environmental regulations, a concessionaire
must obtain a series of permits during the exploitation and exploration stage. The time required to obtain the required permits is dependent on a
few factors including the type of vegetation and trees impacted by proposed activities.
Mining Permits. The Secretariat of Environmental and Natural Resources, the Mexican Government environmental authority ("SEMARNAT"), is
responsible for issuing environmental permits associated with mining. Three main permits required before construction can begin are:
Environmental Impact Statement (known in México as Manifesto Impacto Ambiental) ("MIA"), Land Use Change (known in México as Estudio
Justificativo Para Cambio Uso Sueldo) ("ETJ"), and Risk Analysis (known in México as Analisis de Riesgo) ("RA"). A construction permit is required
from the local municipality and an archaeological release letter must be obtained from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (known as
"INAH"). An explosives permit is required from the ministry of defense before construction can begin. The Environmental Impact Statement is
required to be prepared by a third-party contractor and submitted to SEMARNAT and must include a detailed analysis of climate, air quality, water,
soil, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Risk Analysis study (which is included into the Environmental Impact
Statement and submitted as one complete document) identifies potential environmental releases of hazardous substances and evaluates the risks in
order to establish methods to prevent, respond to, and control environmental emergencies. The Land Use Change requires that an evaluation be
made of the existing conditions of the land, including a plant and wildlife study, an evaluation of the current and proposed use of the land, impacts
to naturally occurring resources, and an evaluation of reclamation/re-vegetation plans.

Customers
The Company sells its concentrates to the buyer who offers the best terms based upon price, treatment costs, refining costs, and other terms of
payment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold gold-silver concentrates to three purchasers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 186 employees, including 182 employees based in México, and 4 in the United States. Consultants are retained
from time to time. Employees based in México and the United States include laborers, engineers, geologists, information technologists, office
administrators, managers and executives. None of our employees in México are covered by union contracts and the Company believes we have
good relations with our employees.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas. In September 2017, the Company entered into a sixty-six-month
extension of the lease through 2023. As part of the agreement the Company received six months free rent as a finish out allowance. The Company
capitalized the leasehold improvement costs and amortized them over the rent abatement period as rent expense. The Company makes tiered lease
payments on the 1st of each month.
We classify our mineral property as an "Exploration Property". We do not suggest that we have proven or probable reserves at our property as
defined by the SEC. Under U.S. standards, as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a
determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination
is made. The SJG Property as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified
as mineral reserves do not have “demonstrated economic viability.” The quantity of resources and the quality (grade) of resources reported as
“Indicated” and “Inferred” mineral resources in the mineral resource estimate compiled for DynaMéxico, under and filed by the Company on
SEDAR, are not disclosed in this Form 10K. There has been insufficient exploration to define any mineral reserves on the SJG Property, and it is not
certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral reserves.

San Jose de Gracia Mineral Property
San Jose de Gracía Property (“SJG”) is a high-grade mineralized system which reports historical production of 1,000,000 Oz. gold (“Au”), from a
series of underground workings and is located in the state of Sinaloa, México. The Company is focused on the exploration and future exploitation of
this vein-hosted, near surface, and over 400 meters down dip gold potential, that occurs within fault breccia veins; and has been traced on surface
and underground over a 15 Sq. kilometer area.
DynaMéxico owns 100% of the mineral concessions at the SJG Property, and all mineral concessions are contiguous. The SJG Property is comprised
of 33 concessions covering approximately 9,920 hectares (24,513 acres).

Surface Lease Rights
In addition to the surface rights held by DynaMéxico pursuant to the Mining Act of México and its Regulations (Ley Minera y su Reglamento),
DynaMineras maintains access and surface rights to the SJG Project pursuant to the 20-year Land Lease Agreement (above). The 20 Year Land
Lease Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido Community surrounding San Jose de Gracía is dated January 6, 2014 and continues through 2033. It
covers an area of 4,399 hectares surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG and provides for annual lease payments by DynaMineras of
$1,359,443 Pesos (approx. $68,250USD as of December 31, 2020), commencing in 2014. Additionally, under the description of the 20 Year Land
Lease, DynaMineras constructed a Medical Facility at SJG in year 2017.
The Land Lease Agreement provides DynaMineras with surface access to the core resource areas of SJG (4,399 hectares), and allows for all
permitted mining, pilot production and exploration activities from the owners of the surface rights (Santa Maria Ejido community).
The Company expects DynaMineras will be successful in expanding the size and scope of the resources at SJG through continued drilling and
development programs at San Pablo, Tres Amigos, La Ceceña, Palos Chinos, San Pablo East, La Purisima, and La Prieta. The Company expects
extensions to mineralization in all directions and down dip from the main target areas.
Mineral Reserves / No Known Reserves
Under U.S. standards, as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been
made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SJG
property is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified as mineral reserves do not have “demonstrated economic viability.”
The quantity of resources and the quality (grade) of resources reported as “Indicated” and “Inferred” mineral resources in the mineral resource
estimate compiled for DynaMéxico is not disclosed in this Form 10-K. There has been insufficient exploration to define any mineral reserves on the
property, and it is not certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral reserves.
Technical Report and Resource Estimate According to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (2012)
In 2012, DynaMéxico commissioned Servicios y Proyectos Mineros (“SPM”) for the production of Technical Report 43-101 (“43-101”) at San Jose de
Gracía. Additionally, DynaMéxico commissioned Mr. Robert Sandefur, a senior reserve analyst for Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC, Lakewood,
CO (“CAM”) to produce a mineral resource estimate for the 4 main vein systems at the property.
Parameters Used to Estimate the Mineral Resource Estimate--The data base for the San Jose de Gracía Project consists of 372 drill holes of which
361 are diamond drill holes (“DDH”) and the remaining 11 were reverse circulation holes “(RC”), with a total drilling of 75,878 meters. The NI 43-
101 Mineral Resource Estimate, prepared in 2012, concentrates on four main mineralized vein systems at SJG: Tres Amigos, San Pablo, La Union,
and La Purisima. Of the 372 drill holes, 368 were drilled to test these four main vein systems and the remaining four holes tested the Argillic Zone.
Technical personnel of Minop S.A. de C.V. (“Minop”), a subsidiary (or affiliate) of Goldgroup Mining Inc., built three dimensional solids to constrain
estimation to the interpreted veins in each swarm. The 172 holes most recently drilled (2009-2011), were allocated as follows: Tres Amigos (64
holes), San Pablo (49 holes), La Union (24 holes), La Purisima (32 holes) and Argillic Zone (3 holes). The data base also includes rock and chip
sampling, regional stream sediment sampling, and IP Surveys.
Density--A total of 5,540 pieces of core were measured for specific gravity using the weight in air vs. weight in water method. This represents an
additional 3,897 measurements taken in the 2009-11 drill seasons with density measurements taken from all mineral zones. Dried samples were
coated with paraffin wax before being measured. The results tabulated have been sorted by lithology and mineralized veins. The average specific
gravity of 5,051 wall rock samples was 2.59 while the average specific gravity for 489 samples of vein material is 2.68. CAM and Servicios y
Proyectos Mineros have reviewed the procedures and results and opine that the results are suitable for use in mineral resource estimation.
Mineral Resource Estimate - Construction of Wireframes--Mineral Resources were estimated by Mr. Sandefur within wireframes constructed by
technical personnel of Minop. Minop was contracted by Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMineras”).

Mineral Resource Estimate - Explanation of Resource Estimation--Resource estimation was done in MineSight and MicroModel computer systems
with only those composites that were inside the wireframe used in the estimate. Estimation was done using kriging with the omni-directional
variogram derived from all the data in each area for gold using the relative variogram derived from the log variogram. High grades were restricted
by capping the assays at a breakpoint based on the cumulative frequency curves. Estimation was done using search radii of 100 x 100 x 50 m
“blocks” oriented subparallel to the general strike and dip of the vein system in each area. A sector search, corresponding to the faces of the search
box with a maximum of two points per sector was used in estimation. A density of 2.68 based on within ‘vein density’ samples was used in the
resource estimate. Within each of the four areas there are approximately 20 to 40 veins in the vein swarm. Resources were estimated by kriging
using data from all veins in the swarm. In general, gold accounts for at least 80% of the value of contained metal at the project, so the variograms
for gold were used in estimation of the four other metals.
The veins at San Jose de Gracía have been historically mined for many years and historic mined volumes are not available. The one exception is the
approximate 42,000 tonnes of ore processed by DynaMéxico during its pilot production activities in 2003-2006. The resource table is not adjusted
for any historic mining. To validate that historic mining had not significantly reduced the resource, CAM reviewed the database for all assays
greater than 1 gram per ton gold that were next to missing values at the bottom of drill holes. Only four assays satisfying this criterion were found,
and on the basis of this review, Mr. Sandefur does not believe that significant mining has occurred within the volumes defined by the wireframes.
Servicios y Proyectos Mineros performed a database review and considers that a reasonable level of verification has been completed, and that no
material issues have been left unidentified from the drilling programs undertaken.
Mineral Resource Estimate and 43-101 Technical Report - Data Verification--Mr. Ramon Luna Espinoza (“Mr. Luna”) initially visited the San Jose de
Gracía Project in November 2010 and conducted site inspections at SJG in November 2011 and January 2012. Mr. Sandefur conducted a site
inspection of the SJG Project in January 2012. While at the Property in November 2011, Mr. Luna inspected the areas of Tres Amigos, La Prieta,
Gossan Cap, San Pablo, La Union, and La Purisima, and historic mining sites. In January 2012, Mr. Sandefur and Mr. Luna inspected the areas of
Tres Amigos, San Pablo, La Union, and La Purisima. Pictures of the areas were taken. Many of the drill pads for the drilling programs of 2007 to
2011 were clearly located and identified. Mr. Luna also inspected at San José de Gracía, the core logging and storage facilities, the geology offices,
the meteorological station, the plant nursery, and the mill. Mr. Sandefur also inspected the core logging and storage facilities.
The Company received from DynaMéxico on February 14, 2012, a National Instrument 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for San Jose de Gracía.
The NI 43-101 Resource Estimate was prepared by Mr. Robert Sandefur, BS, MSc, P.E., a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101, and a
senior reserve analyst for Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC, Lakewood, CO (“CAM”). The Resource Estimate concentrates on four separate main
vein systems at SJG: Tres Amigos, San Pablo, La Union, and La Purisima.
The mineral resource estimates prepared by Mr. Robert Sandefur for this Technical Report included Indicated Resources at Tres Amigos and San
Pablo. Table summaries of Indicated and Inferred Resources are contained in the 2012 DynaMéxico-CAM Mineral Resource Estimate. The Resource
Estimate has been filed, along with the Technical Report on SEDAR; but is not disclosed in this Form 10-K.
Water Concession
The Company has secured the Water Rights Concession for the area surrounding SJG. The Director of Water Administration of the National Water
Commission of México (CONAGUA) formally certified in writing the rights of DynaResource de México, S.A. de C.V. to legally “use”, exploit and
extract 1,000,000 cubic meters of water per year from the DynaMéxico extraction infrastructure located within the perimeter of the mining
concessions comprising the San Jose de Gracía Mining Property in Sinaloa State, México. CONAGUA determined that the DynaMéxico water rights
are not subject to any water rights concession or any other water extraction restriction. Water extracted by DynaMéxico will be subject to
applicable levies imposed by the Mexican tax authorities in accordance with current Mexican tax laws.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
$48M Damages Award to DynaMéxico
On October 5, 2015, DynaMéxico was awarded in excess of US $48 million in damages from Goldgroup Resources, Inc. the subsidiary of Goldgroup
Mining Inc. (“GGA.TO”), by virtue of a Sentencia Definitiva (the “Definitive Sentence”) issued by the Thirty Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court
of Justice of the Federal District of México (Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal), File number 1120/2014. The Definitive Sentence
included the considerations and resolutions by the Court, and additional Resolutions were also ordered in favor of DynaMéxico (together the
damages award and the additional Resolutions are referred to as, the “October 5, 2015 Resolution”).
The October 5, 2015 Resolution also declared:
(a) The AAA (American Arbitration Association) must “cease and desist” from the arbitration proceeding;
(b) The AAA does not have jurisdiction to hear any conflict and/or interpretation arising from the Earn In/Option
Agreement, dated September 1, 2006; and
(c) The AAA does not have jurisdiction to hear disputes arising between shareholders of DynaMéxico, which disputes do
not arise directly and immediately from the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006.
Rejection of Goldgroup Resources Inc. request to the Supreme Court of México
On July 3, 2019 an Official Ruling from The Supreme Court of México was issued to Reject the Request of Goldgroup Resources Inc.
(the “México Supreme Court Rejection to Goldgroup”). The Justices of the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of México issued a
Rejection Notice to Goldgroup Resources Inc., “due to the lack of legitimacy presented by Goldgroup”; and in issuing the Rejection Notice to
Goldgroup, the Supreme court thereby reverted the Amparo Appeal back to the México Circuit Court.
Final Legal Ruling in México (DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling)
On December 6, 2019 the 11th Federal Circuit Collegiate Court in México issued its Final Ruling (“the DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling”). The
DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling denied the Amparo challenge of Goldgroup Resources Inc. The DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling constitutes the Final
Appeal of Goldgroup Resources Inc.; and is Not subject to further appeal or protest.
The DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling is the result and culmination of 7 years of legal action performed by DynaMéxico and is the Final Ruling of the
11th Federal Circuit Collegiate Court. With this DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling issued, all matters before the Court in México with respect to
DynaMéxico and Goldgroup Resources Inc. are fully resolved and are no longer subject to appeal or reconsideration.
DynaMéxico Foreclosure and Recovery of All Remaining Shares of Goldgroup Resources
1. On February 20, 2020, a México City court issued its Final Judgment, effectively foreclosing on all of the remaining shares in DynaMéxico held
by Goldgroup Resources Inc. and awarding the shares to DynaMéxico (the “DynaMéxico Foreclosure Judgment”).
2. The DynaMéxico Foreclosure Judgment awarded to DynaMéxico 100% of the Shares of DynaMéxico previously owned by Goldgroup Resources
Inc. (a Subsidiary Company in México owned 100% by Goldgroup Mining Inc., Vancouver, BC., “GGA.TO”). Prior to the DynaMéxico
Foreclosure Judgment, Goldgroup Resources Inc. owned shares of DynaMéxico constituting 20% of the total outstanding shares of
DynaMéxico (the “Goldgroup Shares of DynaMéxico”). The Goldgroup Shares of DynaMéxico were held under Lien by DynaMéxico since
October 2016.
3. DynaUSA owns 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico. The remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico are held by
DynaMéxico as treasury shares.

DynaUSA and DynaMéxico file Recognition Claim in Dallas County, Texas to Recognize the $48M Foreign Judgment in the US.
On August 28, 2020 DynaUSA and DynaMéxico filed a Recognition Claim in Dallas County Texas USA, in order to register the $48M Foreign
Judgment against Goldgroup Resources Inc. in the US.
On November 6, 2020, the Mexican courts ruled the $48M USD judgement could be transferred to the U.S. to support the Company’s filing of
August 28, 2020.
Arbitration Ruling
In direct contradiction to the October 5, 2015 Definitive Sentence issued by court in México, on August 25, 2016 the American Arbitration
Association - International Centre for Dispute Resolution, Denver office (the “AAA”) issued an Arbitration Ruling (the “Arbitration Ruling”) in favor
of Goldgroup Resources Inc. against DynaMéxico and DynaResource, Inc. The Arbitration Ruling was the result of a proceeding in which neither
DynaMéxico nor DynaResource participated, since the Definitive Sentence issued by the court in México effectively prohibited their participation in
the Arbitration proceeding and should have prohibited Goldgroup Resources Inc. participation.
The Arbitration Ruling provides the following: (i) the Earn In/Option Agreement is still in force, and consequently Goldgroup may appoint two
directors to the DynaMéxico board, and may participate in the appointment of a fifth director; (ii) the DynaMéxico Management Committee is
reinstated, and must approve all budgets and expenditures; (iii) amounts expended by DynaMéxico that were not approved by the Management
Committee are subject to repayment by DynaResource; (iv) the issuance of additional shares by DynaMéxico (and consequent dilution of
Goldgroup’s equity interest) was in violation of the Earn In/Option Agreement; and (v) DynaResource and DynaMéxico are responsible for
Goldgroup’s costs and professional fees associated with the Arbitration Ruling.
Unlike most arbitration proceedings in the U.S., the Arbitration Ruling is not final. Since the Arbitration Ruling is subject to international rules, the
ruling may be vacated by U.S. courts, or simply not recognized by U.S. courts, on several grounds. Accordingly, both DynaMéxico and
DynaResource have timely requested relief from the United States Federal District Court in Colorado, via the filing of a Petition for Nonrecognition
of Foreign Arbitral Award and/or Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award (the “Petition for Nonrecognition”), and a supporting brief. The Petition for
Nonrecognition relies heavily upon the Mexican court’s Definitive Sentence, key excerpts of which appear immediately below.
The Mexican court has already ruled that “any controversy arising from the Earn In/Option Agreement must be brought and resolved
under Mexican Law and by competent Mexican Courts with proper jurisdiction.” Consequently, the monetary awards against
DynaResource – which are based upon a finding that the Earn In/Option Agreement is still in force – will not be enforceable if the
Mexican court rules that the Earn In/Option Agreement is terminated. The Company believes that the potential for the assessment of
a material monetary judgment against DynaResource is remote.
SIXTH: Pursuant to Article 1424 of the Commercial Code of México, the arbitration provision established
under clause 8.16 of the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated as of September 1, 2006, is ineffective
and impossible to execute.
SEVENTH: This Court declares that any controversy arising from the Earn In/Option Agreement must be
brought and resolved under Mexican Law and by competent Mexican Courts with proper
jurisdiction, in recognition of the waiver and exclusion of the arbitration clause (contained in the
Earn In/Option Agreement) by both parties.
EIGHT: This Court declares that the American Arbitration Association must abstain from hearing
arbitration procedure number 50 501 T 00226 14, or any other ongoing and/or future ongoing
arbitration already filed or to be filed by the defendant Goldgroup, based on the Earn In/Option
Agreement dated September 1, 2006.
NINTH: This Court declares that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear any
conflict and/or interpretation arising from the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006.
TENTH: This Court declares that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear
disputes arising between shareholders of DynaMéxico, which disputes do not arise directly and
immediately from the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006.
ELEVENTH: This Court declares that the American Arbitration Association does not have jurisdiction to hear any
matters where Koy Wilber Diepholz, who is the President of the Board of Directors of DynaMéxico,
and has been personally sued in relation to the arbitration clause established under clause 8.16 of
the Earn In/Option Agreement, dated September 1, 2006, since he signed the mentioned instrument
in representation of the Company and not in representation of the Company and not in his personal
capacity.
(a)The Arbitration Ruling contains an acknowledgement by the AAA that the AAA was named as a defendant in the legal demand
filed by DynaMéxico in the Thirty Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of México (the
“DynaMéxico Legal Demand”). The Arbitration Ruling also contains a statement that the AAA was not properly served notice of
the DynaMéxico Legal Demand;
(b) DynaMéxico obeyed the October 5, 2015 Court Order and did not attend the Arbitration hearing;
(c)DynaMéxico will pursue all legal remedies in order to obtain a full dismissal of the Arbitration Ruling;
(d)The October 5, 2015 Court Order and the $48 million USD award of damages against Goldgroup Resources Inc. remains in full
force and effect as issued. DynaMéxico is currently pursuing all available remedies in order to collect $48 million USD in
damages from Goldgroup Resources Inc.
Mercuria Energy Trading, S.A. (“Mercuria”) – Mercuria’s Failure to Perform
On December 8, 2019 Mercuria informed Mineras de DynaResource (“DynaMineras”) that it was terminating its mineral concentrates business.
DynaMineras commenced delivery of Concentrates to Mercuria in February 2017.
On March 16, 2020 DynaMineras was notified by Counsel for the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) that Mercuria had filed a
request for Arbitration.
On April 13, 2020, DynaMineras filed a response to Mercuria Energy Trading, S.A., claiming that Mercuria failed to perform numerous promises
made to DynaMineras to advance funds in the amount of $1.5M USD.; and further challenging amounts payable claimed by Mercuria in the
Arbitration.
The arbitration matter is in the disclosure phase.

DynaUSA and DynaMéxico filed Motion to Vacate Arbitration Ruling
On November 17, 2016, DynaUSA and DynaMéxico filed a Motion to Vacate the Arbitration Ruling in United States District Court, District of
Colorado.
Recommendation to Vacate Arbitration Ruling issued by United States Magistrate Judge
On February 13, 2018 a Recommendation to Vacate the Arbitration Ruling was issued by a United States Magistrate Judge of the United States
District Court, District of Colorado.
On May 9, 2019, the United States district court for the district of Colorado confirmed the August 2016 Arbitration award against DynaResource,
Inc. and DynaResource de México, S.A. de C.V. The district court’s decision overruled the recommendation previously issued by the magistrate
judge to sustain the DynaResource entities’ motion to vacate the arbitration award. Each of DynaResource, Inc. and DynaResource de México, S.A.
de C.V. continues to exercise all its rights, as appropriate, including an appeal.
On March 25, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado denied the motion by DynaUSA and DynaMéxico to alter or amend
its judgment (thereby confirming the August 2016 arbitration award), and denied DynaUSA and DynaMéxico’s motions for stay and judgment
pending appeal and to waive or reduce supersedes bond.
On April 10, 2020, DynaUSA and DynaMéxico appealed the March 25, 2020 ruling to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and in accordance with the
requirements of the appeal, posted a cash bond of $1,111,111 which is being held with the court.
Litigation(s) in México – Company as Plaintiff
The Company, and DynaMéxico have filed several legal actions in México against Goldgroup Mining Inc. and Goldgroup Resources Inc., and certain
individuals retained as agents of Goldgroup Mining Inc., or Goldgroup Resources. The Company and DynaMéxico are plaintiffs in the actions filed in
México and the outcomes are pending.
The Company believes that no material adverse change will occur as a result of the actions taken, and the Company further believes that there is
little to no potential for the assessment of a material monetary judgment against the Company for legal actions it has filed in México. For purposes
of confidentiality, the Company does not provide more specific disclosure in this Form 10-K.
ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
As the Company has no mines located in the United States or any of its territories, the disclosure required by this Item is not applicable.

CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS—INFORMATION CONCERNING PREPARATION OF RESOURCE AND RESERVE
ESTIMATES
The Company is an “OTC Reporting Issuer” as that term is defined in BC Multilateral Instrument 51-105, Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-
Counter Markets promulgated by the British Columbia Securities Commission.
In Canada, an issuer is required to provide technical information with respect to mineralization, including reserves and resources, if any, on its
mineral exploration properties in accordance with Canadian requirements, which differ significantly from the requirements of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to registration statements and reports filed by United States companies pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. As such, certain disclosures of mineralization under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar
information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC and not subject to Canadian
securities legislation.
While these terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities legislation (under National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), entitled
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the SEC does not recognize these terms. Investors in the United States are cautioned not to assume
that any part or all, of the mineral deposits in these categories, will ever be converted to reserves. In addition, inferred mineral resources have a
great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a measured
mineral resource, indicated mineral resource or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities
legislation, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, although they may form, in certain
circumstances, the basis of a “preliminary economic assessment” as that term is defined in NI 43-101. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume
that any part or all, of any reported measured, indicated, or inferred mineral resource estimates referred to in the DynaMéxico NI 43-101 Technical
Report and DynaMéxico 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV), are economically or legally mineable.
Under U.S. standards, as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has been
made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SJG
Property as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is without known reserves. Mineral resources which are not classified as mineral
reserves do not have “demonstrated economic viability.” The quantity of resources and the quality (grade) of resources reported as “Indicated” and
“Inferred” mineral resources in the DynaMéxico 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate compiled for DynaResource de México SA de CV, under
Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and filed by the Company with SEDAR, are not disclosed in this Form 10-K. There has been insufficient
exploration to define any mineral reserves on the SJG Property, and it is not certain if further exploration will result in the definition of mineral
reserves.

Company
The Company is a minerals investment, management, and exploration company, and currently conducting test mining and pilot milling operations
through an operating subsidiary in México, with specific focus on precious and base metals in México. The Company was incorporated in the State
of California on September 28, 1937, under the name West Coast Mines, Inc. In November 1998, the Company re-domiciled from California to
Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. (“DynaUSA”).
We currently conduct operations in México through our operating subsidiaries. We currently own 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaResource
de México, S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMéxico”), and DynaMéxico currently holds 20% of its outstanding shares recovered from Goldgroup Resources Inc.
DynaMéxico owns 100% of mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which comprise the San Jose de Gracía Property, in northern
Sinaloa State, México. We also own 100% of Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMineras”), the exclusive operator of the San José de
Gracía Project, under contract with DynaMéxico. DynaOperaciones is the exclusive management company for registered employees.
Project Improvements, Expansion and Increased Output (2017 To 2020)
The Company continues its business plan of operations at San Jose de Gracía, which is to improve, increase and expand test mining and pilot milling
operations and generally, to increase production of gold ounces. Since January 2015 startup of the test mining and milling activities, the Company
has increased daily output from an initial 75 tons per 24-hour operating day, to a current 200 tons per 24-hour operating day, and during first
quarter 2021 the Company expects to achieve production output of 300 tons per 24-hour operating day. (Note the Summary of Test Mining and
Pilot Mill Operations for 2018 to 2021 below).
Since January 2017, the Company has expended over $13.1 million USD in non-operating costs, generally classified as project improvements and
expansion costs which have been expensed in the company’s financial statements. These funds have been provided primarily from cash flows from
operations. An itemized list of these non-operating costs is described below:
Mill Expansion: $ 1,927,000
Tailings Pond Expansion 265,000
Machinery and Equipment 895,000
Mining Camp Expansion 146,000
Medical Facility 126,000
Mine Development - San Pablo 2,748,000
Mine Expansion - San Pablo East 915,000
Mine Expansion – Tres Amigos 1,599,000
SIG Mining Concessions 1,340,000
Surface Rights and Permitting 238,000
Debt Retirement 484,000
Legal Fees 2,465,000
Total $13,148,000
The Company is currently reporting all costs of mine operations, improvements, and expansion as expenses in accordance with United States
General Accepted Accounting Principal (GAAP) requirements. The result of expensing all costs is that the Company has accumulated a net loss
carry forward from México operations of $37 million USD which is available to offset future taxable earnings.

2020 44,218 5.65 87.31% 7,001 5,828
DynaMineras continued to increase its test underground mining activity and pilot milling operations in 2020; and projects the increased output
from to 300 tons per 24-hour operating /day from the mine and mill during 2021.
Test pilot operations in 2020 yielded 44,218 Tons mined and processed from underground test mining activity and pilot milling operations; and the
production of approximately 7,001 gross Oz Au, and net of dry weight adjustments at the buyer’s facilities, the production of approximately 5,828
Oz Au. The Company reports net revenue of $9,048,831 net of buyer’s price discount and refining and treatment costs.
Test pilot operations in 2019 yielded 66,031 Tons mined and processed from underground test mining activity and pilot milling operations; and the
production of approximately 10,646 gross Oz Au, and net of dry weight adjustments at the buyer’s facilities, the production of approximately 9,713
Oz Au. The Company reports net revenue of $11,612,722 net of buyer’s price discount and refining and treatment costs. In February 2020 the
Company transitioned mining activity from San Pablo to Tres Amigos in order to achieve the opening of the Tres Amigos Mine. The Company
determined it was best to preserve its remaining cash resources and redirect mining efforts to the opening of the Tres Amigos mine and the
upgrade of the Company’s mill with a goal of achieving 300 tons pilot mill production per 24-hour operating day. During this transition period,
limited pilot milling operations were achieved. The Company resumed pilot milling operations in July 2020. Therefore, overall revenue and expenses
related to mining and milling operations were significantly lower for the first six months of 2020 than the same period in 2019. Likewise, mine
expansion expenses are significantly higher.
DynaMineras expects to continue its test underground mining activity and pilot milling operations in 2021; and projects the output of 300 tons per
24-hour operating day from the mine and mill in 2021.
REVENUE. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9,048,831 and $11,612,722, respectively. The Company continued
the test mining and pilot mill processing at San Jose de Gracía, including the production and sale of precious metals concentrates. The YTD
decrease is a result on the company’s transition of test mining operations from San Pablo to Tres Amigos from March to June 2020. Revenue in the
second half of the year increased over 2019 due to the increase in processing capacity from Mill expansion, the higher grade from the opening of
the Tres Amigos mine and the increase in gold prices.
PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO SALES. Production costs related to sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,166,135
and $1,666,521, respectively. These are expenses directly related to the milling, packaging and shipping of gold and other precious metals product.
This represents a decrease in the cost per ton of milling ore. The YTD decrease was due to the Company’s ceasing mill operations from March to

MINE PRODUCTION COSTS. Mine production costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $2,370,972 and $3,557,850
respectively. These costs were directly related to the extraction of mine tonnage to be processed at the mill. The YTD decrease was a result of
decreased tonnage mined.
MINE EXPLORATION COSTS. Mine exploration costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,610,747 and $1,486,037,
respectively. These were the costs of extracting waste material to reach the materials to be extracted for processing. The YTD increase was a result
of opening the Tres Amigos mine.
MINE EXPANSION COSTS: Mine expansion costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $909,190 and $689,405, respectively.
These were the costs associated with the expansion of the mining facilities and the cost associated with preparing the Tres Amigos for production.
TRANSPORTATION. Transportation costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $528,423 and $816,504, respectively. These were
the costs of transporting the product to the customer for treatment and sale. The decrease is consistent with the overall decrease in production.
CAMP, WAREHOUSE AND SUPPORT FACILITIES. Camp, warehouse and support facility cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
were $2,036,610 and $2,547,910, respectively. These were the support costs of the mining facilities including housing, food, security and
warehouse operations. The decrease was a result of decreased activity at the camp during the shutdown of mining activity.
PROPERTY HOLDING COSTS. Property holding costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $137,377 and $446,806, respectively.
These costs were concessions taxes, leases on land and other direct costs of maintaining the property. The 2019 costs included settlement of prior
year’s concession for an amount in excess of the accrual. The current year costs consist only of core concessions and the reduced area of the
Francisco Arturo concession.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were
$2,996,073 and $2,053,083 respectively. These were the costs of operating the Company not directly associated with the mine operations including
management, accounting, and legal expenses. The year-to-date increase was largely a result of legal fees associated with the Company’s successful
recovery of the non-controlling stock and legal cost of the Company’s new financing.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). Other income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(2,685,878) and $793,803 respectively.
Included in this category in 2020 was interest expense of $(1,133,360), change in derivative of $(1,186,964), currency transaction loss of
$(361,127), and other expense of $(4,427). Included in this category in 2019 was interest expense of $(492,907), other income of $970, change in
derivative liability of $888,579 and currency transaction gain of $397,161. The increase in derivative liability is the result of the extension of stock
warrants and the issuance of new convertible debt and stock warrants as part of the Golden Post financing. Likewise, the increase in interest
expense is reflective of the Company’s increase in debt.
NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. The non-controlling interest portion of the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $61,589
and $62,511, respectively. This represented the non-controlling interest share of Dyna México’s loss. The 2020 allocation included only the non-
controlling interest’s share of the net loss for January and February as the non-controlling interest was eliminated at the end of February.
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). Comprehensive income (loss) includes the Company’s net income (loss) plus the unrealized currency
translation gain (loss) for the period. The Company’s other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of
unrealized currency gains (losses) of $100,582 and $(970,981), respectively. The YTD decrease is due to the variances in the peso exchange rates
throughout the two years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $(5,778,992), comprised of current assets of $6,818,412 and current liabilities of
$12,597,404. This represented a decrease of $2,422,622 from the working capital maintained by the Company of $(3,356,370) as of December 31,
2019. The primary reason for the decrease was the increase in derivative liabilities associated with the Company’s new financing.
17

Net cash provided by (used in) operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(2,421,108) compared to $(1,321,360) in the year ended
December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily the result of the Company’s increase in operating loss as a result of the Company’s suspension of
production mining and pilot milling operations during the first half of the year.
Net cash provided by (used) in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0 and $0, respectively. In 2020 and 2019
expenditures necessary for the expansion of mining operations totaling $168,806 and $639,199, respectively which would normally have been
included in this category were expenses due to the company’s lack of proven and probable reserves.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,594,323 compared to $(111,977) for the year
ended December 31, 2019. The increase represents the net proceeds from the Company’s Golden Post financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Plan of Operation
The Plan of operation for the next twelve months includes DynaMineras continuing the improvement and expansion of the test mining and pilot
milling operations at SJG. The Company commenced its testing activities in fall 2015 at the rate of approximately 100 tons per 24-hour operating
day from the mine and approximately the same output from the processing plant. Over the past five years, the Company has gradually increased its
output to approximately 200 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mines and processing plant. In 2021, the Company projects to complete its
phases of expansion to reach the output of approximately 300 tons per 24-hour operating day from the mine and the processing plant.
The Company funds its general and administrative expenses in the US. The Company’s operating subsidiaries, DynaMineras and DynaOperaciones,
receive monthly fees for management of SJG activities and personnel. These amounts are eliminated in consolidation. The Company believes that
cash on hand, and including cash flow generated from its current operations, is adequate to fund its ongoing general and administrative expenses
through 2021.
Capital Expenditures
The Company’s primary activities relate to the test mining and pilot milling operations of the SJG property through its 100% owned operating
subsidiary, DynaMineras. DynaMineras is conducting activities at SJG under the terms of the Exploitation Amendment Agreement (the “EAA”, or
“operating agreement”) with DynaMéxico.
No Known Reserves
The SJG property is without known reserves. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless a determination has
been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
Exploitation Amendment Agreement (“EAA”)
On May 15, 2013, DynaMineras entered into an Exploitation Amendment Agreement (“EAA”) with DynaMéxico. The EAA grants to DynaMineras the
right to finance, explore, develop and exploit the SJG Property, in exchange for: (A) Reimbursement of all costs associated with financing,
maintenance, exploration, development and exploitation of the SJG Property, which costs are to be charged and billed by DynaMineras to
DynaMéxico; and, (B) After Item (A) above, the receipt by DynaMineras of 75% of gross receipts received by DynaMéxico from the sale of all
minerals produced from SJG, to the point that DynaMineras has received 200% of its advanced funds; and, (C) after items (A) and (B) above; the
receipt by DynaMineras of 50% of all gross receipts received by DynaMéxico from the sale of all minerals produced from SJG, and throughout the
term of the EAA; and, (D) in addition to Items (A), (B), and (C) above, DynaMineras shall receive a 2.5% NSR (“Net Smelter Royalty”) on all
minerals sold from SJG over the term of the EAA. The total Advances made by DynaMineras to DynaMéxico as of December 31, 2014 is $4,025,000.
The EAA is the third and latest Amendment to the original Contract Mining Services and Mineral Production Agreement (the “Operating
Agreement”), which was previously entered into by DynaMineras with DynaMéxico in April 2005, wherein DynaMineras was named the Exclusive
Operating Entity at SJG. The Operating Agreement was previously amended in September 2006 (the “First Amendment”) and amended again at July
15, 2011 (the “Second Amendment”). The Term of the Second Amendment is 20 years, and the EAA (Third Amendment) provides for the
continuation of the 20 Year Term from the date of the Second Amendment (July 15, 2011).
18

Exclusive Operating Entity at San Jose de Gracía
Under agreement with DynaMéxico, Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (“DynaMineras”) has been named the exclusive operating entity at the
San Jose de Gracía Project. DynaResource owns 100% of DynaMineras.
DynaMéxico General Powers of Attorney
The Chairman-CEO of DynaUSA also serves as the President of DynaMéxico and as the President of DynaMineras. The President of DynaMéxico
holds broad powers of attorney granted by the shareholders of DynaMéxico which gives the current President significant and broad authority within
DynaMéxico.
Note Receivable and Investments in Affiliate
DynaResource Nevada, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“DynaNevada”), with one operating subsidiary in México, DynaNevada de México, S.A. de C.V.
(“DynaNevada de México”) have common officers, directors and shareholders. The total amount loaned by the Company to DynaNevada at
December 31, 2010 was $805,760. The terms of the Note Receivable provided for a “Convertible Loan,” repayable at 5% interest over a 3-year
period, and convertible at the Company’s option into Common Stock of DynaNevada at $0.25 / Share. On December 31, 2010, the Company
converted its receivable from DynaNevada into 3,223,040 Shares of DynaNevada; and as a result, the Company owns 19.92% of the outstanding
shares of DynaNevada. DynaNevada is therefore a related entity, and through its subsidiary in México (DynaNevada de México), (“DynaNevada de
México”), has entered into an Option agreement with Grupo México (“IMMSA”) in México, for the exploration and development of approximately
3,000 hectares in the State of San Luis Potosi (“the Santa Gertrudis Property”). The Company had a receivable from DynaResource Nevada, Inc. of
$71,465 and $73,976 at December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The Company has an investment balance in DynaResource Nevada, Inc. of
$70,000 and $70,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Stockholders DynaResource, Inc.
Irving, Texas
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of DynaResource, Inc. (the "Company") and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020,
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Prior Period Financial Statements
The financial statements of DynaResource, Inc. as of December 31, 2019, were audited by other auditors whose report dated June 9, 2020, and
expressed an unmodified opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Derivative Liabilities
As described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the derivative liabilities represent the embedded conversion features of the Series
C Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Notes Payable. The Company has classified the derivative liabilities as Level 3 liabilities and the fair
value of the liabilities are evaluated each reporting period. As of December 31, 2020, the derivative liabilities were $2,371,560. The derivative
liabilities include both quantitative and qualitative components. The calculation of the fair value of the derivative liabilities used a Black-Scholes
pricing model. Key components of the fair value calculation included: the annual volatility rate, the risk-free rate, the remaining term, and the fair
value of the underlying common stock.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the derivative liabilities is a critical audit
matter is: there was significant judgment and estimation used by management in determining the fair value of the derivative liabilities, which led to
an increased level of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the
derivative liabilities, including the qualitative component.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. These procedures included documenting the control environment in which judgements were made. These
procedures also included, testing the reasonableness of the assumptions management used in the Black-Scholes pricing model, recalculating the
change in fair value, and performing a stress-test on the assumptions.

DYNARESOURCE, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020 and 2019
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Activities, History and Organization
DynaResource, Inc. (The “Company”, “DynaResource”, or “DynaUSA”) was organized September 28, 1937, as a California corporation under the
name of West Coast Mines, Inc. In 1998, the Company re-domiciled to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. The Company is in
the business of acquiring, investing in, and developing precious metal properties, and the production of precious metals.
In 2000, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, DynaResource de México S.A. de C.V., chartered in México (“DynaMéxico”). This
Company was formed to acquire, invest in and develop resource properties in México. DynaMéxico owns a portfolio of mining concessions that
currently includes its interests in the San José de Gracía Project (“SJG”) in northern Sinaloa State, México. The SJG District covers 9,920 hectares
(24,513 acres) on the west side of the Sierra Madre mountain range. The Company currently owns 80% of the outstanding capital of DynaMéxico.
DynaMéxico currently holds 20% of the Shares of DynaMéxico as treasury shares, after complete foreclosure and recovery of those shares on
February 20, 2020 from Goldgroup Resources Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldgroup Mining Inc. Vancouver, BC (“Goldgroup”).
In 2005, the Company formed DynaResource Operaciones de San Jose De Gracía S.A. de C.V. (“DynaOperaciones”) as an operating subsidiary to
manage registered employees, and acquired effective control of Mineras de DynaResource, S.A. de C.V. (formerly Minera Finesterre S.A. de C.V.,
“DynaMineras”). The Company owns 100% of DynaMineras and 100% of DynaOperaciones.
The Company elected to become a voluntary reporting issuer in Canada in order to avail itself of Canadian regulations regarding reporting for
mining properties and, more specifically, National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”). This regulation sets forth standards for reporting resources in
a mineral property and is a standard recognized in the mining industry.
Significant Accounting Policies
The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of
internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among
other items that: 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a
timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for
the respective periods presented.
Basis of Presentation
The Company prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
Use of Estimates
In order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and determines whether contingent assets and
liabilities, if any, are disclosed in the financial statements. The ultimate resolution of issues requiring these estimates and assumptions could differ
significantly from the resolution currently anticipated by management and on which the financial statements are based.
Principles of Consolidation
The financial statements include the accounts of DynaResource, Inc., as well as DynaResource de México, S.A. de C.V. (100% ownership),
DynaResource Operaciones S.A. de C.V. (100% ownership) and Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (100% ownership). All significant inter-
company transactions have been eliminated. All amounts are presented in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated.
27

Non-Controlling Interest
The Company’s subsidiary, DynaResource de México S.A. de C.V, was 20% owned by Goldgroup Resources, Inc. until February 20, 2020 when the
Company recovered the shares as partial satisfaction of a legal judgement. See Note 10 for further details.
The Company accounted for this outside interest as a “non-controlling interest” through February 2020. A 20% share of operating income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss) was allocated to the non-controlling interest through the date of the recovery of the shares.
Investments in Affiliates
The Company owns a 19.95% interest in DynaResource Nevada, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“DynaNevada”), with one operating subsidiary in
México, DynaNevada de México, S.A. de C.V. (“DynaNevada de México”), together “DynaNevada”. The Company accounts for this investment using
the cost basis. The Company has significant influence over DynaNevada, but not control, due to the lack of a majority voting interest in the entity.
DynaNevada has been dormant for several years. DynaUSA has no plan or intention of future funding with DynaNevada nor are any other
transactions with DynaNevada contemplated at this time. The Company therefore accounts for this investment using the cost basis. The investment
was $70,000 and $70,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At times, cash
balances may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had
$1,507,278 of deposits in U.S. Banks in excess of the FDIC limit.
Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for accounts receivable is recorded when receivables are considered to be doubtful of collection. As of December 31, 2020, and
2019, respectively, no allowance has been made.
Foreign Tax Receivable
Foreign Tax Receivable is comprised of recoverable value-added taxes (“IVA”) charged by the Mexican government on goods and services rendered
to the company in Mexico and paid by the company. Under certain circumstances, these taxes are recoverable by filing a tax return and application
for reimbursement. IVA Amounts charged to and paid by the company are recorded and carried as receivables until the funds are collected by the
company. The total amounts of the IVA receivable as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were $2,179,914 and $1,297,387, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value and consist of mined tonnage, gravity and flotation concentrates, and gravity
tailings or flotation feed material. The inventories were $603,967 and $523,089 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
28

Proven and Probable Reserves (No Known Reserves)
The definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7 (“Industry Guide 7”). Proven reserves for which (1) quantity is
computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed
sampling and (2) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geological character is so well defined that size,
shape, depth and mineral content of the reserves are well-established. Probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality
are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are
farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high
enough to assume continuity between points of observations.
As of December 31, 2020, none of the Company's properties contain resources that satisfy the definition of proven and probable reserves. The
Company classifies the development of its properties, including the San Jose de Gracía Property, as exploration stage projects since no proven or
probable reserves have been established under Industry Guide 7.
Technical Report and Resource Estimate According to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (2012)
In 2012, DynaMéxico commissioned Servicios y Proyectos Mineros (“SPM”) for the production of Technical Report 43-101 (“43-101”) at San Jose de
Gracía. Additionally, DynaMéxico commissioned Mr. Robert Sandefur, a senior reserve analyst for Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC, Lakewood,
CO (“CAM”) to produce a mineral resource estimate for the 4 main vein systems at the property.
Property and Equipment
Substantially all mine development costs, including design, engineering, mine construction, and installation of equipment are expensed as incurred
as the Company has not established proven and probable reserves on any of its properties. Only certain types of mining equipment which has
alternative uses or significant salvage value, may be capitalized without proven and probable reserves. Depreciation is computed using the straight-
line method. Office furniture and equipment are being depreciated on a straight-line method over estimated economic lives ranging from 3 to
5 years. Leasehold improvements, which relate to the Company's corporate office, are being amortized over the term of the lease of 10 years.
Design, Construction, and Development Costs: Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related
costs to delineate an ore body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways,
shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines.
When proven and probable reserves as defined by Industry Guide 7 exist, development costs are capitalized, and the property is a commercially
minable property. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine
areas substantially in advance of current production would be capitalized. Costs of start-up activities and costs incurred to maintain current
production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations as incurred. Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations
upon abandonment. All capitalized costs would be amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on
recoverable ounces to be mined from proven and probable reserves.
Certain costs to design and construct mining and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves. As no
proven and probable reserves have been established on any of the Company's properties, design, construction and development costs are not
capitalized at any of the Company's properties, and accordingly, substantially all costs are expensed as incurred, resulting in the Company
reporting larger operating expenses than if such expenditures had been capitalized. Additionally, the Company does not have a corresponding
depreciation or amortization of these costs going forward since these expenditures were expensed as incurred as opposed to being capitalized. As a
result of these and other differences, the Company's financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of mining companies
that have established reserves as defined in Industry Guide 7.
29

Mineral Properties Interests
Mineral property interests include acquired interests in development and exploration stage properties, which are considered tangible assets. The
amount capitalized relating to a mineral property interest represents its fair value at the time of acquisition. When a property does not contain
mineralized material that satisfies the definition of proven and probable reserves, such as with the San Jose de Gracía Property, capitalized costs
and mineral property interests are amortized using the straight-line method once production begins. As of December 31, 2020, the mining interests
have been in the pilot production stage and therefore, no amortization has been expensed. Mining properties consist of 33 mining concessions
covering approximately 9,919 hectares at the San Jose de Gracía property (“SJG”), the basis of which are amortized on the unit of production
method based on estimated recoverable resources. If it is determined that the deferred costs related to a property are not recoverable over its
productive life, those costs will be written down to fair value as a charge to operations in the period in which the determination is made. The
amounts at which mineral properties and the related costs are recorded do not necessarily reflect present or future values.
Impairment of Assets: The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Mineral properties are monitored for impairment based on factors such as mineral
prices, government regulation and taxation, the Company's continued right to explore the area, exploration reports, assays, technical reports, drill
results and its continued plans to fund exploration programs on the property.
For operating mines, recoverability is measured by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows to the net book value. When the net book
value exceeds future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the excess of the net book value over fair
value. Fair value for operating mines is determined using a combined approach, which uses a discounted cash flow model for the existing
operations and a market approach for the fair value assessment of exploration land claims. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of
recoverable mineralized material, expected gold and silver prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production
levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The term "recoverable mineralized material"
refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after considering losses during processing and treatment of
mineralized material. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company's estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous
assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of
recoverable minerals, gold, silver and other commodity prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and
uncertainties.
The recoverability of the book value of each property is assessed annually for indicators of impairment such as adverse changes to any of the
following:
● estimated recoverable ounces of gold, silver or other precious minerals;
● estimated future commodity prices;
● estimated expected future operating costs, capital expenditures and reclamation expenditures.
A write-down to fair value will be recorded when the expected future cash flow is less than the net book value of the property or when events or
changes in the property indicate that carrying amounts are not recoverable. This analysis is completed as needed, and at least annually. As of the
date of this filing, no events have occurred that would require write-down of any assets. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, no indications of
impairment existed.
Asset Retirement Obligation
As the Company is not obligated to remediate the mining properties, no Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) has been established. Changes in
regulations or laws, any instances of non-compliance with laws or regulations that result in fines, or any unforeseen environmental contamination
could result in a material impact to the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation.
Pre-Pilot Production Costs
During 2016, the Company conducted rehabilitation activity at the San Pablo mine and refurbished the Pilot Mill Facility at San Jose de Gracía and,
in general prepared for test mining and pilot milling (“Pilot Production”) Operations. The costs associated with the rehabilitation, preparation, clean
up and facilitation of this process were expensed as pre-pilot production costs.
30

Property Holding Costs
Holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred. These costs include security
and maintenance expenses, lease and claim fees and payments, and environmental monitoring and reporting costs.
Exploration Costs
Exploration costs are charged to operations and expenses as incurred. Exploration, development, direct field costs and administrative costs are
expensed in the period incurred.
Transactions in and Translations of Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the subsidiaries of the Company is the Mexican Peso. As a result, the financial statements of the subsidiaries have been
translated from Mexican Pesos into U.S. dollars using (i) year-end exchange rates for balance sheet accounts, and (ii) the weighted average
exchange rate of the reporting period for all income statement accounts. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss).
The financial statements of the subsidiaries should not be construed as representations that Mexican Pesos have been, could have been or may in
the future be converted into U.S. dollars at such rates or any other rates.
Relevant exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements for the subsidiaries are as follows for the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2019 (Mexican Pesos per one U.S. dollar):
Dec 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2019
Current exchange rate Pesos 19.91 18.86
Weighted average exchange rate for the period
ended Pesos 21.47 19.25
The Company recorded currency transaction gains (losses) of $(361,127) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $397,161 for the year ended
December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 “Income Taxes” using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis of liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates
either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. The Company derives the
deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The
Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.
Income from the Company’s subsidiaries in México are taxed in accordance with applicable Mexican tax law.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
ASC 220 “Comprehensive Income” establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. The Company’s comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss),
consisting of unrealized net gains and losses on the translation of the assets and liabilities of its foreign operations.
31

Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted ASC 606 “Revenue from contracts with customers” on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The
Company generates revenue by selling gold and silver produce from its mining operations. The Company recognizes revenue for gold and silver
concentrate production, net of treatment and refining costs, when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control of the concentrate
to the customer. This is generally when the material is delivered to the customer facility for treatment and processing as the customer has the
ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the material and the customer has the risk of loss.
The amount of revenue recognized is initially recorded on a provisional basis based on the contract price and the estimated metal quantities based
on assay data. The revenue is adjusted upon final settlement of the sale. The chief risk associated with the recognition of sales on a provisional
basis is the fluctuations between the estimated quantities of precious metals based on the initial assay and the actual recovery from treatment and
processing.
As of December 31, 2020, there are $2,500,000 in customer deposit liabilities for payments received during the period for contracts expected to be
settled in 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 there was $0 and $1,750,000 of revenue recognized during the period from
customer deposit liabilities (deferred contract revenue) from prior periods, and $0 of customer deposits refunded to the customer due to order
cancellation.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there are no deferred contract costs or commissions.
We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs after the customer obtains control of the concentrate.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock options at fair value as prescribed in ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation”. The Company estimates the
fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and provides for expense recognition over the
service period, if any, of the stock option.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, payables and long-term debt. The carrying amount of cash, receivable and
payables approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value
due to the relationship between the interest rate on long-term debt and the Company’s incremental risk adjusted borrowing rate.
Per Share Amounts
Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings per Share”. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period is used to compute basic earnings (loss) per share. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average
number of shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares are additional common shares assumed
to be exercised. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of stock warrants, convertible preferred shares and convertible notes and are excluded
from the diluted earnings per share computation in periods where the Company has incurred a net loss, as their effect would be considered anti-
dilutive.
The Company had 3,391,855 warrants outstanding at December 31, 2020 which upon exercise, would result in the issuance of 3,391,855 shares of
common stock. Of these warrants 2,166,527 were exercisable at $2.05 per share and 1,225,308 were exercisable at $.01 per share. The Company
also had convertible debt instruments as of December 31, 2020 which, upon conversion at valuations from $2.00 to $2.50 per share, would result in
the issuance of 2,227,312 shares of stock.
The Company had 2,166,527 warrants outstanding at December 31, 2019 exercisable at $2.50 per share, which upon exercise, would result in the
issuance of 2,166,527 shares of common stock. The Company also had convertible debt instruments as of December 31, 2019 which, upon
conversion at a valuation of $2.50 per share, would result in the issuance of 335,250 shares of stock.

Related Party Transactions
FASB ASC 850 "Related Party Disclosures" requires companies to include in their financial statements disclosures of material related party
transactions. The Company discloses all material related party transactions. A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly
or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also
include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its
management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating
policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party
which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the
transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02— Leases (Topic 842). The update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. As
such, The Company was required to adopt these provisions as of the fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2019. The Company elected the available
practical expedients and adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, prospectively. The adoption of this standard resulted in the initial recognition
of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $878,605 and $891,023, respectively, with no material impact on the results of operations and cash
flows. See Note 10 for additional information regarding our leases.
NOTE 2 – INVENTORIES
The Company commenced underground test mining and pilot milling activities (“pilot production”) in the 2nd quarter of 2014. Rehabilitation of the
San Pablo Mine and refurbishing of the Pilot Mill Facility and construction of the adjacent tailings pond continued through 2016. Inventories are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value and consist of mined tonnage, gravity-flotation concentrates, and gravity tailings (or flotation feed
material). Inventory balances as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were as follows:
2020 2019
Mined Tonnage, Gold-Silver Concentrates, and/or Gravity Tailings (Flotation Feed Material) $ 603,967 $ 523,089

The Company purchased no equipment during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization has been provided over each asset’s estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization expense was $3,249 and
$3,255 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.
NOTE 4 – MINING CONCESSIONS
Mining properties consist of the San Jose de Gracía (“SJG”) concessions. Mining Concessions were $4,132,678 and $4,132,678 at December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
There was no depletion expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
NOTE 5 – INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE/RECEIVABLES FROM AFFILIATE/OTHER ASSETS
The Company owns 19.95% DynaResource Nevada, Inc. (“DynaNevada”), a Nevada Corporation, which owns 100% of one operating subsidiary in
México, DynaNevada de México, S.A. de C.V. (“DynaNevada de México”). DynaNevada is a related entity (affiliate), and through its subsidiary,
DynaNevada de México has entered into an Option agreement with Grupo México (IMMSA) in México, for the exploration and development of
approximately 3,000 hectares in the State of San Luis Potosi (“The Santa Gertrudis Property”). DynaNevada de México exercised the Option with
IMMSA in March 2010, so that DynaNevada de México now owns 100% of the Santa Gertrudis Property. In June 2010, DynaNevada de México
acquired an additional 6,000 hectares in the State of Sinaloa (the “San Juan Property”).
On December 31, 2010, the Company received 3,223,040 shares, which represents approximately 19.95% of the outstanding shares of
DynaNevada. At the time of the exchange, DynaNevada’s net book value was approximately $695,000, consisting of $30,000 of cash and the
remainder being unproven mining properties. Subsequent, to the exchange management determined the investment to be impaired due to lack of
development of the properties and incurred a charge to the income statement. Management estimated the value of the Company’s DynaNevada
shares as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to be $70,000 and $70,000, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had a receivable from DynaNevada de México of $71,465 and $73,976, respectively
for working capital advances. These amounts are included in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 6 – CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES
Notes Payable – Series I
In April and May 2013, the Company entered into note agreements with shareholders in the principal amount of $1,495,000, of which $340,000 was
then converted to preferred shares within the same year, netting to proceeds of $1,155,000 (the “Series I Notes”). The Series I Notes bear simple
interest at twelve and a half percent (12.5%), accrued for twelve months, and with the accrued interest to be added to the principal, and then
interest will be paid by the Company, quarterly in arrears. The holders of the Series I Notes (in aggregate) are also entitled to receive ten percent
(10%) of the net profits received by the Company, on the first fifty thousand tons processed through the mill facilities at San Jose de Gracía. Such
net profits (if any) are to be calculated after deducting “all expenses related to the production”, and after a prior deduction of thirty-three percent
(33%) from the net profits, to be deposited into a sinking fund cash reserve. To date, the Company has not produced any net profits as calculated in
accordance with the Series I Notes.
The Notes originally matured on December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, seven of the Series I Notes totaling $646,875 had subsequently
been extended to December 30, 2019. On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into agreements to extend seven outstanding notes totaling
$646,875 plus accrued interest totaling $34,277 for new total notes of $691,152 until December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019 Series I Notes

Company at $2.50 per share. At the time of conversion, the holder would receive a warrant to purchase additional common shares of the Company
for $7.50 per share, such warrant expiring one year from their conversion date.
NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES

when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The cumulative tax effect at the expected tax rate of 21% of
significant items comprising the Company’s net deferred tax amounts as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows:

The realization of deferred tax benefits is contingent upon future earnings and is fully reserved at December 31, 2020.
On December 11, 2013, the Mexican government enacted a tax reform that increased the effective tax rate applicable to the Company's Mexican
operations. The law, effective January 1, 2014, increased the future corporate income tax rate to 30%, created a 10% withholding tax on dividends
paid to non-resident shareholders and created a new Extraordinary Mining duty which is equal to 0.5% of gross revenues from the sale of gold,
silver and platinum. Furthermore, the reform introduced a Special Mining Duty of 7.5%. The Special Mining Duty is deductible for income tax
purposes. The Special Mining Duty is generally applicable to earnings before income tax, depreciation, depletion, amortization and interest. There
will be no deductions related to development type costs, but exploration and prospecting costs are deductible when incurred. Certain non-deducted
exploration expenditures incurred prior to January 1, 2014 are also deductible in the calculation of the Special Mining Duty. For the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no taxes payable under the 7.5% Special Mining Duty.
The Company or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and México. These tax returns are subject to examination by local
taxation authorities provided the tax years remain open to audit under the relevant statute of limitations. The following summarizes the open tax
years by major jurisdiction:
United States: Three years after utilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforward
México: 2016 to 2020
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to UTBs on the interest expense line and other expense line of the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related liability lines in the accompanying balance sheet.

Financing Agreement with Golden Post Rail, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company
1. On May 6, 2015, the Company, Golden Post Rail, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Golden Post”), and Mr. Koy W. (“K.D.”) Diepholz,
Chairman-CEO of the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”). Pursuant to the SPA, Golden Post acquired the
following securities:
a) 1,600,000 shares of Series C Senior Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred”) at a purchase price of $2.50 per share ($4M
USD), plus an additional 133,221 shares of Series C Preferred pursuant to anti-dilution provisions. The Series C Preferred is entitled to
receive dividends at the per share rate of four percent (4%) per annum, ranks senior (in priority) to the Common Stock, the Series A

an exercise price of $2.50 per share, and expiring June 30, 2020. The anti-dilution protections contained in the terms of the Series C
Preferred are essentially replicated in the Golden Post Warrant. The expiration of the Golden Post Warrant was extended on May 14, 2020,
pursuant to an additional financing agreement with Golden Post.
2. Pursuant to the SPA, the Company executed a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which Golden Post may require the Company to
register the shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred and the shares of Common Stock

Additional Financing Agreement with Golden Post Rail, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company, and with Shareholders of
DynaResource, Inc.
On May 14, 2020, the Company closed an additional financing agreement with Golden Post, and with certain individual shareholders of DynaUSA
(“DynaUSA Shareholders”), and related agreements. A summary of the transactions and related agreements are set forth below:
1. Pursuant to the May 14, 2020 Note Purchase Agreement (the “NPA”) among the Company, Golden Post Rail, LLC (the “Lead Purchaser”),
and the other parties listed on Exhibit A thereto (the “Remaining Purchasers”):
● Golden Post acquired the following securities:

Company’s common stock, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, and maturing on the 10-year anniversary of the date of issuance.
The Remaining Purchasers Warrants contain anti-dilution provisions.

2. Also pursuant to the NPA, the Company and the Lead Purchaser have agreed to amend the common stock purchase warrant dated June 30,
2015 (the “2015 Warrant”), issued to the Lead Purchaser in connection with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 6,
2015. The 2015 Warrant contemplates the purchase, upon exercise, of 2,166,527 shares (subject to adjustment) of the Company’s common
stock and matured June 30, 2020 (the “Termination Date”). The amendment to the 2015 Warrant provides that, following the expiration of
the 2015 Warrant pursuant to its terms, the Company will issue to the Lead Purchaser a new warrant (the “New Warrant”), substantially in
the same form of the 2015 Warrant, for the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that went unexercised on the Termination
Date, if any. The New Warrant has a maturity date of June 30, 2022.
3. As part of the transaction contemplated by the NPA, the Company executed an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
pursuant to which Golden Post may require the Company to register the shares of common stock which may be issued upon (i) the
conversion of the Series C Senior Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred”), (ii) the conversion of the Series D Preferred, and (iii)
the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2015 Warrant, the 2020 Warrant, and a compensatory warrant issued to the
Lead Purchaser on May 13, 2020 (described below under the heading “Compensatory Issuances”), including any additional shares of
common stock issuable pursuant to anti-dilution provisions of such securities.
4. Pursuant to the transaction contemplated by the NPA, the Company agreed to call a special meeting of Company stockholders, to be held
not later than July 14, 2020, to solicit stockholder approval of (a) an amendment of the Company’s certificate of incorporation to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock from 25,000,000 shares to 40,000,000 shares, and (b) an amendment of the Certificate of
Designations of the Series C Preferred, in order to (a) extend the maturity date of the Series C Preferred by an additional two (2) years, (ii)
add an equity cap in respect of the conversion of Series C Preferred into common stock of the Company, and (iii) add certain restrictions on
the ability of the Company to issue Series C Preferred.
The special meeting was properly called and held on July 13, 2020, whereby Company stockholders confirmed approval for each item
referenced in item 4 above.
5. Compensatory Issuances. On May 13, 2020, one business day prior to the NPA, the Company issued to the Lead Purchaser the following: (i)
a common stock purchase warrant for 2,306 shares, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, and maturing on the 7-year anniversary of the
date of issuance (the “Compensatory Warrant”); and (ii) 1,771 shares of Series C Preferred Shares. These issuances were occasioned by the
Company’s obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 6, 2015.
6. In order to accommodate the issuance of the additional 1,771 shares of Series C Preferred, on May 13, 2020 the Company filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Increase of Series C Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, to increase the number of shares of
preferred stock designated as Series C Preferred from 1,733,221 shares to 1,734,992 shares (“Certificate of Increase”).
(1) Also, on May 13, 2020, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of the Powers, Preferences and
Relative, Participating, Optional and Other Special Rights of Preferred Stock and Qualifications, Limitations and Restrictions thereof of Series D
Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, contemplating the authorization of 3,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred (“Certificate of Designation”).
The sale of the Golden Post Note, the Remaining Notes, the 2020 Warrant, the Remaining Purchasers Warrants, the Compensatory Warrant, and
the Series C Preferred was made pursuant to a privately negotiated transaction that did not involve a public offering of securities and, accordingly,
the Company believes that the transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof.
Each investor represented that it (A) is an “accredited investor” and (B) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
the investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquiring the securities acquired by such investor. All of the foregoing securities are
deemed restricted securities for purposes of the Securities Act.
Due to underlying anti-dilutive provisions contained in the Series C Preferred Shares and the Golden Post Warrant, the Company incurred
derivative liabilities. On May 14, 2020 in connection with the Series D Convertible Note financing, the expiration date for the Series C Preferred
Shares and the Golden Post warrants were extended to June 30, 2022. In addition, a new derivative liability was incurred due to the issuance of
warrants for kicker shares at December 31, 2019 the total derivative liability was $86,104 which included $37,038 for the Series C Preferred
shares, and $49,066 in connection with the Golden Post Warrants. At December 31, 2020 the total derivative liability was $2,371,560 which
included $601,313 for the Series C Preferred Shares, and $817,613 in connection with the Golden Post Warrants and $952,634 in connection with
the Series D Convertible Note Kicker Warrants. The deemed dividend for the years ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was
$173,499 and $173,320 respectively. As the Company has not declared these dividends, it is required only as an item “below” the net income (loss)
amount on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).
Due to the nature of this transaction as mandatorily redeemable, the preferred shares are classified as “temporary equity” on the balance sheet.

NOTE 9 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Transactions
Dynacap Group Ltd.
The Company paid $114,250 and $146,125 to Dynacap Group, Ltd. (“Dynacap”, an entity controlled by the CEO of the Company) for consulting and
other fees during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Advances from Goldgroup Mining Inc. (“Goldgroup”) to DynaMéxico
In 2014, Goldgroup advanced $111,500 to DynaMéxico and in 2013 Goldgroup advanced $120,000 USD to DynaMéxico. This total of $231,500 was
carried by DynaMéxico as a Due to Non-Controlling Interest. This balance was removed as part of the elimination of the non-controlling interest in
February 2020. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the balance of Due to Non-Controlling interest was $0 and $231,500, respectively.
NOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Concession Taxes
The Company is required to pay taxes in México in order to maintain mining concessions owned by DynaMéxico. Additionally, the Company is
required to incur a minimum amount of expenditures each year for all concessions held. The minimum expenditures are calculated based upon the
land area, as well as the age of the concessions. Amounts spent in excess of the minimum may be carried forward indefinitely over the life of the
concessions and are adjusted annually for inflation. Based on Management’s recent business activities and current and forward plans and
considering expenditures on mining concessions from 2002-2017 and continuing expenditures in current and forward activities, the Company does
not anticipate that DynaMéxico will have any difficulties meeting the minimum annual expenditures for the concessions ($388 – $2,400 Mexican
Pesos per hectare). DynaMéxico retains sufficient carry-forward amounts to cover over 10 years of the minimum expenditure (as calculated at the
2017 minimum, adjusted for annual inflation of 4%).
41

Leases
In addition to the surface rights held by DynaMéxico pursuant to the Mining Act of México and its Regulations (Ley Minera y su Reglamento),
DynaMineras maintains access and surface rights to the SJG Project pursuant to the 20-year Land Lease Agreement. The 20 Year Land Lease
Agreement with the Santa Maria Ejido Community surrounding San Jose de Gracía was dated January 6, 2014 and continues through 2033. It
covers an area of 4,399 hectares surrounding the main mineral resource areas of SJG and provides for annual lease payments on January 1st each
year by DynaMineras of $1,359,443 Pesos (approx. $72,000 USD), commencing in 2014. The Land Lease Agreement provides DynaMineras with
surface access to the core resource areas of SJG (4,399 hectares), and allows for all permitted mining and exploration activities from the owners of
the surface rights (Santa Maria Ejido community).
The Company leases office space for its corporate headquarters in Irving, Texas. In September 2017, the Company entered into a sixty-six-month
extension of the lease through 2023. As part of the agreement the Company received six months free rent as a finish out allowance. The Company
capitalized the leasehold improvement costs and amortized them over the rent abatement period as rent expense. The Company makes tiered lease
payments on the 1st of each month.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842, which requires recognition of a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases at the
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures
regarding the Company's leasing arrangements are also required. The Company adopted ASC 842 prospectively and elected the package of
transition practical expedients that does not require reassessment of (1) whether any existing or expired contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease
classification and (3) initial direct costs. In addition, the Company has elected other available practical expedients to not separate lease and non-
lease components, which consist principally of common area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an
initial term of 12 months or less.
The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has two operating leases - a six-
and one-half year lease for office space with a remaining term of twenty-four months and a twenty-year ground lease in association with its México
mining operations with a remaining term of thirteen years. Variable lease costs consist primarily of variable common area maintenance, storage
parking and utilities. The Company’s leases do not have any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
As the implicit rate is not readily determinable for most of the Company’s lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing

$48M USD Damages Awarded to DynaMéxico in México Litigation
On October 5, 2015, DynaResource de México SA de C.V. (“DynaMéxico”), was awarded in excess of $48 M USD (Forty-Eight Million Dollars) in
damages from Goldgroup Resources, Inc. (the “Goldgroup Damages”) by virtue of a Sentencia Definitiva (the “Definitive Sentence”) issued by the
Thirty Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of México (Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal), File
number 1120/2014. The Definitive Sentence included the considerations and resolutions by the Court, and additional Resolutions were also ordered
in favor of DynaMéxico (together the Goldgroup Damages and the additional Resolutions are referred to as, the “Oct. 5, 2015 Resolution”).
On October 5, 2016, the Thirty-Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of México (Tribunal Superior de Justicia del
Distrito Federal) approved a Lien (referred to by the court as an “Embargo”), in favor of DynaMéxico, upon Stock Certificates in the name of
Goldgroup Resources Inc. (“Goldgroup”). The Stock Certificates subject to the Lien (“Embargo”) constitute Shares of DynaMéxico (“the Goldgroup
DynaMéxico Shares”).
On August 24, 2017 a Federal Amparo Judge (“Juzgado de Distrito”) in the State of Vera Cruz, México, dismissed Goldgroup Resources Inc’s
Amparo Trial Challenge to the $48 M USD damages award previously granted in favor of DynaMéxico. Pursuant to the dismissal ruling, the $48M
USD damages award, previously granted to DynaMéxico by the Thirty-Sixth Civil Court of the Superior Court of Justice of the Federal District of
México on October 5, 2015, was effectively confirmed.
43

On May 27, 2019, The Eleventh Collegiate Court in Civil Matters of the First Circuit (“México Circuit Court”, and the Court of Final Appeal for
Goldgroup Resources Inc.) issued a written notice confirming it was ruling against the Amparo Appeal filed by Goldgroup Resources Inc. and in
Favor of DynaResource de México, S.A. de C.V. In an effort to stay the issuance of the Ruling by the México Circuit Court, Goldgroup Resources
Inc. filed a request to The Supreme Court of México to review the Amparo Appeal decision.
On July 3, 2019 an Official Ruling from The Supreme Court of México was issued to Reject the Request of Goldgroup Resources Inc. (the “México
Supreme Court Rejection to Goldgroup”). The Justices of the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of México issued a Rejection Notice to
Goldgroup Resources Inc., “due to the lack of legitimacy presented by Goldgroup”; and in issuing the Rejection Notice to Goldgroup, the Supreme
court thereby reverted the Amparo Appeal back to the México Circuit Court where the Official and Final Ruling from the México Circuit Court was
issued.
On December 6, 2019 the 11th Federal Circuit Collegiate Court in México issued its Final Ruling (“the DynaMéxico Final México Legal Ruling”).
The DynaMéxico Final México Legal Ruling is Favorable to DynaMéxico, and denies the Amparo challenge of Goldgroup Resources Inc., the
subsidiary of Goldgroup Mining Inc. (“GGA.TO”). The DynaMéxico Final México Legal Ruling constitutes the Final Appeal of Goldgroup Resources
Inc.; and is not subject to further appeal.
The DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling is the result and culmination of 7 years of legal action performed by DynaMéxico and is the Final Ruling of the
11th Federal Circuit Collegiate Court. With this DynaMéxico Final Legal Ruling issued, all matters before the Court in México with respect to
DynaMéxico and Goldgroup Resources Inc. in México are fully resolved and are no longer subject to appeal or reconsideration.
Legal Summary - Consequence of the DynaMéxico Final México Legal Ruling :
1. The $48,280,808.34 USD damages award (dated October 05, 2015) in favor of DynaMéxico and against Goldgroup Resources Inc.
is now Final. Goldgroup Resources’ challenge(s) to that award have been fully denied and the damages award is Final.
2. The Lien against the Shares of DynaMéxico owned by Goldgroup Resources Inc. (established October 5, 2016, the “Lien against
Goldgroup Shares”) is now fully confirmed, final, and enforceable.
3. Ownership of the shares of DynaMéxico held by Goldgroup Resources (currently representing 20% of the outstanding shares of
DynaMéxico) are subject to the lien against Goldgroup Shares.
DynaMéxico Foreclosure and Recovery of All Remaining Shares of Goldgroup Resources
1. On February 20, 2020, a México City court issued its Final Judgment, effectively foreclosing on all of the remaining shares in DynaMéxico held
by Goldgroup Resources Inc. and awarding the shares to DynaMéxico (the “DynaMéxico Foreclosure Judgment”).
2. The DynaMéxico Foreclosure Judgment awarded to DynaMéxico 100% of the Shares of DynaMéxico previously owned by Goldgroup Resources
Inc. (a Subsidiary Company in México owned 100% by Goldgroup Mining Inc., Vancouver, BC., “GGA.TO”). Prior to the DynaMéxico
Foreclosure Judgment, Goldgroup Resources Inc. owned shares of DynaMéxico constituting 20% of the total outstanding shares of
DynaMéxico (the “Goldgroup Shares of DynaMéxico”). The Goldgroup Shares of DynaMéxico were held under Lien by DynaMéxico since
October 2016.
3. DynaUSA owns 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico; DynaMéxico holds 20% of the outstanding shares of DynaMéxico as treasury
shares.
DynaUSA and DynaMéxico file Recognition Claim in Dallas County, Texas to Recognize the $48M Foreign Judgment in the US.
On August 28, 2020 DynaUSA and DynaMéxico filed a Recognition Claim in Dallas County Texas USA, in order to register the $48M Foreign
Judgment against Goldgroup Resources Inc. in the United States.
On November 6, 2020, the Mexican courts ruled the $48M USD judgement could be transferred to the U.S. to support the Company’s filing of

Appeal of U.S. Arbitration Award and Posting of Appeal Bond
On March 25, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado denied the motion by DynaUSA and DynaMéxico to alter or amend
its judgment (thereby confirming the August 2016 arbitration award), and, denied DynaUSA and DynaMéxico’s motions for stay and judgment
pending appeal and to waive or reduce supersedes bond.
On April 10, 2020, DynaUSA and DynaMéxico appealed the March 25, 2020 ruling to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and in accordance with the
requirements of the appeal, posted a cash bond of $1,111,111 which is being held with the court.
Mercuria Energy Trading, S.A. (“Mercuria”) – Mercuria’s Failure to Perform
On December 8, 2019 Mercuria informed Mineras de DynaResource (“DynaMineras”) that it was terminating its mineral concentrates business.
DynaMineras commenced delivery of Concentrates to Mercuria in February 2017.
On March 16, 2020 DynaMineras was notified by Counsel for the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) that Mercuria had filed a
request for Arbitration.
On April 13, 2020, DynaMineras filed a response to Mercuria Energy Trading, S.A., claiming that Mercuria failed to perform numerous promises
made to DynaMineras to advance funds in the amount of $1.5M USD.; and further challenging amounts payable claimed by Mercuria in the
Arbitration.
The arbitration matter is in the disclosure phase.
Litigation
The Company believes that no material adverse change will occur as a result of the legal actions taken, and the Company further believes that there
is little to no potential for the assessment of an adverse material monetary judgment against the Company for legal actions it has filed in México.
Further, the Company believes there is no legal basis for which to conduct arbitration proceedings.
Coronavirus Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread
throughout the United States of America. Efforts implemented by local and national governments, as well as businesses, including temporary
closures, are expected to have adverse impacts on local, national and the global economies. Although the disruption is currently expected to be
temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration and the related economic impact. Therefore, while we expect this matter to have an impact our
business, the impact to our results of operations and financial position cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
NOTE 11 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES
Preferred Series C Stock
As discussed in Note 8, the Company analyzed the embedded conversion features of the Series C Preferred Stock and determined that the stock
qualified as a derivative liability and is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as such since the host and the embedded instrument are not
clearly and closely related. The Company performed a valuation of the conversion feature. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the
guidance in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements”, to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible.
In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in
the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The Company considered the inputs in this valuation to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 and used an equity simulation model to
determine the value of the conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock based on the assumptions below:
2020 2019
Annual volatility rate 156% 144%
Risk free rate 0.13% 1.58%
Remaining Term 1.50 years 0.5 years
Fair Value of common stock $0.78 $0.47
45

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, an active market for the Company’s common stock did not exist. Accordingly, the fair value of
the Company’s common stock was estimated using a valuation model with level 3 inputs.
The below table represents the change in the fair value of the derivative liability during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Period Ended 2020 2019
Fair value of derivative (stock), beginning of period/year $ 37,038 $ 402,909
Change in fair value of derivative 276,547 (365,871)
Fair value of derivative on the date of extension 287,728 -
Fair value of derivative(stock), end of period/year $ 601,313 $ 37,038
Preferred Series C Warrants
As discussed in Note 8, the Company analyzed the embedded conversion features of the Series C Preferred Stock and determined that the Warrants
qualified as a derivative liability and is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as such since the host and the embedded instrument are not
clearly and closely related. The Company performed a valuation of the conversion feature. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the
guidance in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements”, to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

Fair value of derivative(warrants), end of period/year $ 817,613 $ 49,066

Series D Notes Kicker Warrants
As discussed in Note 8, the Company analyzed the conversion features of the Series D Notes and determined that the Warrants qualified as a
derivative liability. The fair value was required to be allocated among the notes, conversion features, and the warrants, and then remeasured at
each reporting date. The Company performed a valuation of the conversion feature. In performing the valuation, the Company applied the guidance
in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements”, to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date (exit price). To measure fair value, the Company incorporates assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability and utilizes market data to the maximum extent possible.

requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The Company considered the inputs in this valuation to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 and used an equity simulation model to
determine the value of conversion feature of the Series D Warrants based on the assumptions below:
2020
Annual volatility rate 156%
Risk free rate 0.13%
Remaining Term 10.00 years
Fair Value of common stock $ 0.78
For the year ended December 31, 2020, an active market for the Company’s common stock did not exist. Accordingly, the fair value of the
Company’s common stock was estimated using a valuation model with level 3 inputs.
The below table represents the change in the fair value of the derivative liability during the year ended December 31, 2020.

NOTE 13 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
described below:
Level 1 InputsQuoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
–
Level 2 InputsQuoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
– active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.
Inputs –
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Company’s financial assets were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs, with the
exception of cash, which was valued using Level 1 inputs. A description of the valuation of the Level 3 inputs is discussed in Note 11.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 Internal Control—
Integrated Framework) at December 31, 2020. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal
control over financial reporting were effective.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules
of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
We added additional internal controls to mitigate the material internal control weaknesses reported in the 2019 10K. These additional controls
consist of an additional review during the consolidation and SEC reporting process to review for items capitalized in the operating subsidiaries
which must be expensed for SEC reporting due to the lack of proven and probable reserves.
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules
of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.
