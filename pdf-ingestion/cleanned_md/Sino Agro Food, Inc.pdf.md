The Company has been severely impacted by the effects of COVID-19 “Pandemic 2020”, which effects continue to this day as such presently the
Company is no longer a fully reporting company and has dropped from quoting on OTCQX to OTC Pink sheet from September 2020 onward due
primarily to the Company’s auditors, which are located in Hong Kong, have been unable to do on-site inspections of the Company’s operations in
China due to COVID-19 restrictions to complete the audit of 2019 and 2020. So Basically SIAF is delinquent in its Form 10-Ks for fiscal year end

</Chart Analysis>
A summary of each business division and operations is described below:
1. Businesses Division:
· Fishery Division refers to the operations of Capital Award Inc. (“Capital Award” or “CA”) covering its engineering, technology and
consulting service management of fishery farms, technology transfers and seafood sales and marketing, fishery developments global (excluding
China) and agriculture developments global where;
Capital Award generates revenues from providing engineering consulting services as turnkey contractors to owners and developers of fishery
and agriculture projects that are being designed and engineered into turnkey contracts by Capital Award globally (excluding China) using its A
Power Module Technology Systems (“APM”) for fishery projects’ developments and using other agricultural technologies, knowhow and
patents expanded from the development of SJAP for agriculture development projects globally as follows:
(A). Engineering and Technology Services; via Consulting and Service Contracts (“CSC’s”) for the development, construction, and supply
of plant and equipment, and management of fishery (and prawn or shrimp) farms and related business operations. From January 2020 up to the
date of this annual report CA has not been able to do any fishery project or fishery project development due to the effects of the Pandemic
COVID-19 as such, there was no revenue generated from January 2020 to May 31st 2021. However, the Company and CA have been exploring
other possible business opportunities during the period and SIAF became the joint venture partner of the China Africa Joint Chamber of
Commerce and Industries (CAJCCI) which is a non-profit organization established in November 2016 by the China and Africa Governments to
plan and to implement agriculture projects and related developments in Africa through development fund of US$60 Billion every three years
provided by and granted by the China Government to Africa Nations in Agriculture industry projects and developments etc. In March 2021,
development project papers in (i). Development of Trading of exporting dried cassavas to China and exporting of plant and equipment from
China to Madagascar and developments of cassavas plantations and related value added processing and drying of cassavas on 100,000 acres of
land in Madagascar and (ii). Development of goat farms and related value added processing in Madagascar were submitted to CAJCCI and
Government of Madagascar; by early May 2021, both CAJCCI and the Government of Madagascar gave consents to both projects such that we
have obtained official invitation to go to Madagascar to initiate the Projects subjecting to the Pandemic COVID-19 situation and conditions will
be improved and controlled, we shall have our team members (including various professionals and professionals from CAJCCI) to assist our
current Madagascar management teams of two members in Madagascar to start up the Projects.
(B). Seafood Sales from CA’s projected farms; became a discontinued segment of operations from October 5, 2016 when Tri-way was
disposed to other third parties in term Tri-way was reclassified as an unconsolidated equity investee on same date.
5

l Corporate & Others Division refers to the trading segment of business operations of the Group named internally under corporate division of
Sino Agro Food, Inc., including import/export business and consulting and service operations provided to projects that are not included in the
above categories, and not limited to corporate affairs. Over the years up until end of fiscal year 2019 the corporate division imported mainly live
seafood from South Africa countries, Vietnam, Thailand, Russian and other nearby countries and frozen beef from Australia and South America
countries; however it is due to the interruptions and adverse impacts caused by the Pandemic COVID-19 made it impossible and unprofitable to
continue the imports of live seafood, and the poor political relationship between China and Australia in 2020 induced high risks on the imports
of Australian beef. The Corporate’s trading division based on standalone figures ended up with a loss of over $1.6 million as at 31.12 2020.
However, over the years the Company has built up a strong base of connections and customers in China that provides an unique opportunity to
the Company to develop an additional Trading Platform aiming to generate additional revenues, profits and most importantly positive cash
flows, so from July 2020 onward, the corporate division started to explore the opportunities of importing some of the China markets’ niche
products and managed to start to import from March 2021, frozen chicken (that China imports millions of metric tons annually) and pork
products (that China has been in shortage since the pandemic of European Swine Diseases occurred in 2018 disrupted the domestic supply of
pork estimated until year 2026), from Brazil, USA, Argentina and other South America countries and (ii). Dried agriculture products (i.e. Dried
Cassavas that has vast industrial and consumable food processing applications, that China has an annual short fall of over 4 million MT;
peanuts, cashew-nuts, Soybeans that China imports multiples of millions of MT annually, etc.) from South Africa Countries (i.e. Madagascar,
Ghana, Nigeria and Cote D’lovire etc.) and Brazil. Although in so far the Company achieved minimal financial impacts, (please refer to a
standalone Q1 2021 income statement of the Trading division attached in the later Chapter named Subsequent events). During months of
venturing into this trading activity, we experienced many teething problems and obstacles especially with the supplies of the said commodities
affected mainly by the said Pandemic situations causing much stringent and constant changes of importation regulations requiring much
tougher importation and cargoes release conditions and procedures, précised timely and orderly documentary presentation with the China
custom authority and extremely tight controls domestically disorientated all arrangements with domestic cold storages and logistic operations
etc. resulting in inconstancy of the supplies and untimely deliveries etc. Disregarding all of these difficult consequences and hardship, the
Company feels that persistence, tolerance and with time, the trading division will prevailed leading the Company into a positive cash path
targeting encourage performances to show starting from the early quarter 1 of fiscal year 2022. ’
Leasing and subcontracting Division:
Over the years, there has been significant capital expenditures (CPE) and working capital (WC) required for and employed on the developments,
expansion and operations of the minor operational activities that we managed to fund while our two core businesses (in the Cattle and beef of SJAP
and the Fishery of CA) were generating sufficient cash flows and incomes, however after the collapse of the SJAP’s business from 2016 and the
poor performances of the Mega farms from 2017 (“Crises”) for reasons mentioned in the earlier chapters and the previous Ks and Qs reports, the
Company is no longer in the position to support and to finance the growth of these minor operational businesses in the way as they were before the
Crises, therefore in order that capital spending could be kept within an affordable level, the Company decided to lease and sub-contract the
following operations to their respective operational managements from 1st October 2019 as such there are no sales revenue and income derived
from these operations but leasing and sub-contracting revenues and incomes thereon.
6

l The operation of Hunan Shenghua A Power Agriculture Co. Ltd. (“HSA”) is in manufacturing and sales of organic fertilizer. From 1st October
2019 the Company contracted out its manufacturing and sales of organic fertilizer to its operational management; as such income of HSA is
derived mainly from said management contract. Historically, HSA was developed to enhance more sales and profits of SJAP’s fertilizer due to
the availability of a direct cargo train service between Xining and Hunan having a station within close proximity to HSA’s operation site and
Hunan is a strong agricultural province producing big quantity of rice, tobaccos, tea and multiple varieties of produces that requires large
quantity of fertilizer (especially in organic fertilizer due to the Government’s direction to phase out the application of chemical fertilizer in
China). During the period of developing HSA’s business it was discovered that Hunan is big in aquaculture having many and large areas in
natural fresh water lakes where aquaculture of fresh water fish is a dominated industry, as such HSA developed a water soluble organic
fertilizer specially applied for and by the lake fishery farms to provide nutrients to the water plants and micro-organism for the sea animals etc.
Although it was an excellent product but aging receivables were always a big problems to HSA with the fishery operators, the constant up-keeps
and replacements of new production plants & equipment and the forever requirement of expending working areas and buildings to keep up with
the productivity and the long (i.e. over 60 days) period of fermentation of raw materials required huge capital funds (both in CPE and WC) that
the Company was not able to supply consistently and that was why HSA hasn’t reached its ultimate potential of becoming a multiple millions MT
per year producer. However HSA has a block of leased hilly land of 450 Chinese Mu, in which HSA developed 50 Mu originally for a cattle
station that was changed into a piggery (with the capacity to hold 4,000 pigs at a time and producing 10,000 heads of pigs per year) in 2017
after the collapse of the local cattle industry. It was necessary to cut half of the hill in the said 50 Mu to get enough leveled land to build the
said piggery, then it was discovered that the 450 Mu land consisting many fine sand hills. From 2018 onward the China Government stopped
most of the sand mining operations in the country so all of a sudden fine construction sand became a valuable commodity with 2019’s averaged
prices (of RMB245 / cubic meter or m3) jumped more than 12 times of 2017’s averaged prices. As such HSA is sitting on a block of valuable
property. But sand mining is restricted by the China Government Regulation so it is impossible to obtain any sand mining permits. By
September of 2020 the Company strategically designed a business plan for HSA to expand its piggery to produce 200,000 head of pigs per
annual using and developing the whole of said 450 Mu that will be financed ultimately by the fine sand recovered from said development’s
leveling activities. In this aspect, the related Project’s business plan (including all feasibility, viability and environmental studies) have been
prepared with approaches and dialogues have been made with a number of China owned entities aiming to attract enough investors to finance
the Project as soon as possible. Although currently the Pandemic effects hinder many businesses’ decisions making it difficult to predict any
tangible schedule for this Hunan Project, however, our management team members are working diligently on it hoping that soon a clearer road
will be opened to allow them to pick up momentum on the Project.
l Plantation Division refers to the operations of Jiangmen City Heng Sheng Tai Agriculture Development Co. Ltd. (“JHST”) in the HU Plantation
business where dragon fruit flowers (dried and fresh), crops of vegetables and immortal vegetables (dried) are sold to wholesale and retail
markets. JHST’s financial statements are consolidated into the financial statements of Macau EIJI Company Ltd. (“MEIJI”) as one entity. From
1st October 2019 the Company contracted out its plantation operation to its operational management; as such income of JHST is derived mainly
from said management contract. Over the years, the Company has tried many means to increase the performances of the plantation (of 1,250
Chinese Mu) but failed due mainly to the plantation is situated in an area subjecting to heavy rainfalls yearly that induced root diseases to the
dragon fruit plants stopping the yield of flowers. 1,250 Mu plantation is too small for growing of other selective fruit plants except for the
growing of cash crops (i.e. seasonal vegetables etc.), however growing of cash crops is labor intensive, so with the forever increases of labor
and operation costs in China and the seasonal unpredictable sales prices of cash crops, managements of the Company has yet to find a suitable
solution for JHST but keep on trying hoping that eventually a perfect solution will surface to revitalize JHST. In the meantime leasing and
contracting JHST ‘s operation to its existing operational management will limit the Company’s financing exposure in both CPE and WC
requirements from JHST.
l Cattle Farm Division refers to the operations of Cattle Farm 1 under Jiangmen City Hang Mei Cattle Farm Development Co. Ltd (“JHMC”)
where cattle are sold live to third party livestock wholesalers who sell them mainly to Guangzhou and Beijing livestock wholesale markets. The
financial statements of JHMC are consolidated into MEIJI as one entity along with MEIJI’s operation in the consulting and service for
development of other cattle farms (e.g., Cattle Farm 2) or related projects. From 1st October 2019 the Company contracted out its cattle
operation to its operational management; as such incomes of JHMC are derived mainly from said management contract. JHMC’s business
strategy in 2018 of changing into fattening of the Asian Yellow Cattle instead of the fattening of conventional breed of cattle (i.e. Angus and
Simantals etc.) proven to be a good strategic change increasing revenues and incomes each year ever since. However this cattle operation is too
small (with. Cattle Farm 1 and 2 operate on 500 Chinese Mu) coupling with the increasing of land and development costs making it extremely
difficult for the Company to finance its expansion plan at the moment as such by leasing and contracting JHMC’s cattle operation to its existing
operational management will provide the Company with a small but steady incomes each year and will limit capital funding to JHMC until such
time the Company is in a better financial position to consider JHMC’s expansion plan.

2. The Investees
SJAP: Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co., Ltd
l A fully integrated cattle and beef business was developed from 2008 under SJAP, (a joint venture company incorporated in China whereby SIAF
has an equity interest of 45% and the management controlling interest allowing the VIT arrangement with consolidated financial as a subsidiary
of SIAF until Q3 2019 when Mr. Solomon Lee resigned the Chairmanship from SJAP), and starting business (or income generated) operation
from 2010 (consisting of fertilizer manufacturing, pasture farms, farmers’ corporative, cattle rearing and growing, abattoirs or slaughter
operation, value added beef processing and packaging, primary livestock feed producing, industrial concentrated livestock feed manufacturing,
marketing networks with retails as well as wholesaling operation etc.); as such by 2016 this cattle and beef segmental business was producing,
processing and marketing over 20,000 heads of cattle per year managing more than 2,000 corporative farmers, 50,000 Chinese Mu (equivalent
to 8,500 acres) of pasteurized farm land, over 50,000 (square meter, m2)of operational buildings developed on over 400 Chinese Mu (equivalent
to about 70 acres) of Industrial and / or commercial zoned land in Huangyuen district of Xining City. In November 2015 the China Government
announced a Macro Economic Policy to allow the imports of cattle and beef from many developing and developed countries that impacted
adversely and directly to its local cattle and beef industry, all of a sudden the local cattle and beef industry was transformed from a protected
industry to a non-protected industry, as such SJAP was on a decline financially since 2016 that took SJAP 3 full years to stop the bleeding
capped the losses totaling to S$ 12 million as shown in SIAF’s 10K 31.12 2019 report. On September 30th 2019, Mr. Solomon Lee resigned as
the Chairman of SJAP resulting in categorization of SJAP as an Investor in Associate from a subsidiary status, and SJAP contracted out its
business operations to its existing management. However the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, SJAP again suffered badly with
further losses of $1.28 million that was saved by a Government Grant of $1.48 million netting incomes of $200,000 for 2020. It is because SJAP
became an investee of SIAF since 01102019 such that its 2020 financial is not detailed in SIAF’s annual report 2020 financial report but under
Others and Subsequent events of SIAF’s annual report 2020 a separated information memorandum shows SJAP’s 2020 Income Statement.

purchase and to sell its developed farms’ productions. In the land lease agreement, the land was allocated gradually ZSAPADL as and when
respective earlier lease holds to other farmers are expired such that there was a total of 1,350 Chinese Mu (equivalent to about 225 acres)
available for Phase (1) of the Project’s developments as of year 2015, however during 2018 and 2019, 250 Chinese Mu were given back to the
local Government by ZSAPADL for the constructions of highways and a Wet-Land Project involving part of the Project land netting about 1,100
Chinese acres (or the equivalent of less than 200 acres of the Project land available for project developments currently). This particular
project’s developments are planned over 10 years in multiple phases and subsequent stages etc. with construction to start in 2015 and
operation incomes to be generated from sometimes in 2017 aiming annual production over 100,000 MT by end of year 2025. By the mid-year
2017, we completed almost 85% of the development of two indoor APRAS farms (APM farms) each measuring 9,000 m2 totaling to 18,000m2 of
building areas on a block of land of 60 Chinese Mu (equivalent to 10 acres) and 165 open APRAS dams (ODRAS) on about 990 Chinese Mu
(equivalent to about 165 acres) of land (Phase 1 stage 1 development) that we called the “Mega Farm” or Aqua-farm 4 & 5 (AFF 4 & 5). In 2016
The Company’s carve-out of Tri-way resulting in categorization of Tri-way as an Investor in Associate from a subsidiary status. As such, the
Company’s fully owned subsidiary namely, Capital Award Inc. a company incorporated in Belize City, Belize (CA), retained its main business
activity in the sector of technology and engineering consulting and related services and Tri-way Industries Limited, a private company
incorporated in Hong Kong (Tri-way) has assumed all activity regarding aquaculture operations and the sale of all live fish and seafood products
produced by all developed APM farms as well as ODRAS Dams. Therefore as from October 1, 2016, all future fishery project development in
China using APM-RAS or ODRAS will be developed by Tri-way. CA has been hired by Tri-way as the Company’s turnkey contractor for its fishery
developments in China and to provide consultation respective of Tri-way’s operations. CA’s aim, in addition to providing quality service to Tri-
way in China, is expecting to expand its reach to introduce and help implement its APM-RAS and ODRAS plant and equipment and services,
worldwide.
To complete the transformation of Tri-way From October 5th 2016 we brought out the remaining 25% equity interest in “Jiangmen City A Power
Fishery Development Co. Ltd, China” (“JFD”) and sold the 100% equity interest in JFD to Tri-way (inclusive all original assets of its one farm
namely Aqua-Fish Farm 1(AFF 1) with other additional assets transferred from work in progress etc.) and converted JFD into a Wholly Owned
Foreign Entity (WOFE) such that Tri-way is holding 100% equity interest in JFD for $51.226 million; at the same time Triway acquired a Master
License from CA for the rights of future development and operation of our APRAS farms in China for $30 million and simultaneously (on October
5th 2016) JFD completed the acquisition: of the assets and operation from owners and investors of four other aquaculture farms (namely Aqua-farm
2, 3 and 4) for $215.56 Million such that the total transformation and acquisition cost of Tri-way at $340 million (in round figure) that were satisfied
by 100 million Tri-way shares at unit price of $3.40 / share capitalizing into fully paid-up capital of $340 million (or HK$2.635 billion). Our
corporation SIAF was to receive 36.6 million Tri-ways shares (or 36.6% of equity) for the sales of JFD and Master license for 23.89 million (or
23.89% equity) plus the conversion of the amount due from unconsolidated equity investee into equity interest during the fourth quarter of 2017,
which resulted in equity interest in Tri-way from 23.89% to 36.60%.
9

We announced our (good will) intension with the approval of Tri-way’s management of distributing 18.3% of Tri-way equity interest (about half of
SAIF’s holding) from our 36.6% equity interest to our shareholders and prepared a F1 for filing to SEC accordingly sometimes in 2018 . However
complication of USA taxation was one of the major issues that have not been resolved and at that time period Mr. Dan Ritchey was our CFO
responsible for the said distribution of Tri-way shares but he passed away on December 1st 2018 as such we were searching for a new CFO and
consequently, Mr. Solomon Lee (I) serves as the Company’s interim CFO that enhanced the delay in processing said distribution of Tri-way shares
to SIAF’s shareholders. Also 2019 was a traumatic year for the Corporation having lost the services of our most brilliant CFO, our long time
independent directors namely Mr. Nils Erik Sandberg and Mr. Anthony Soh who have been serving our Corporation since 2010, the recruitment
and reappointment of new directors and audit committee members in Mr. Colanukuduru Ravindran and Mr. Muson Cheung, the reorganization of
the Corporation’s other segmental operations; The Corporation’s common stocks were delisted from the Merkur Market (OSLO) from September
10th 2019, On September 30th 2019, the Company contracted out the following businesses’ operations to the existing management of the
corresponding operations: (i). SJAP’s integrated cattle activity to Mr. Zhao Y L, the legal representative and MD of SJAP, (ii). HSA’s manufacturing
of fertilizer to Mr. Lee Ping the existing manager of HSA and (iii). JHST’s plantation operation and MEIJI’s cattle operations to Mr. Fang Zhi Jun,
the existing manager of both operations, On September 30th 2019, Mr. Solomon Lee resigned as the Chairman of SJAP resulting in categorization
of SJAP as an Investor in Associate from a subsidiary status, the preparation of S1 and S4 for the IPO exercise of 2 million G Series Preferred
Shares of the Corporation to be listed on the OTCQX Market and the Derivative Complaint of Heng Ren and Co. etc. that involved lots of extra costs
in time, money and human resources of the Corporation such that it was not practically possible to carry out said distribution of Tri-way shares in
2019. Year 2020 is another disaster year for the Corporation due to the COVID-19 Pandemic incurring losses in excessive of $100 million (which is
an earlier estimate subjecting to final derivation of the segmental accounting departments)
Similarly Tri-way experienced extremely poor operational performances from its Mega Farm (AFF 4 & 5) and its incomes in 2017 to 2019 were
generated mainly from the operations of AFF 1, 2 , 3a & 3b and other sub-contracted farms:
In fact, the operation of the Mega Farms (AF4 and AF5 and the ODRAS dams) had a poor start and performed badly in 2017 and by the first half of
2018 and the end of 2018, their operations (under their operation company ZSAPADL) incurred debts over $4.5 million and $4 million respectively,
due primarily to i). Unsuccessful management coordination resulting in low productivity and sales of products, (ii). Over spending on capital
expenditure on Phase (1) Stage (1) of the Mega Farm Project which exceeded the original budget of $50 million by more than 60%, as a result, it
limited available cash-flow to support the needs of working capital that affected the overall production and sales leading to, there were not enough
funds to complete some of the supporting facilities needed by the APM farms (i.e., the external filtration systems, lighting, electrical wiring,
external drainages for waste water and connection and fitting for the supply of fresh water etc.), supporting external water dams and waste water
treatment dams, the heating facility and part of the internal filtration systems that made it difficult for the farms to carry out their production
efficiently, (iii). The production operation of the Mega Farms started prematurely before all the completion of their construction & development
works, (iv) The two APM farms are the biggest indoor farms that we have ever built, and we didn't have enough experienced personnel to support
their operation, (v). Guangzhou experienced a very hot summary in 2017 that killed and retarded many stocks in the open dams (ODRAS dams) and
one of the big typhoons during August 2017 caused flooding that washed away hundreds of tons of fish and prawns in the open dams that would
have been ready for harvest in September & October of 2017. Also, the extremely strong Typhoon in September 2018 caused power stoppage that
killed hundreds of tons of stock including some valuable brood stock.
However, by August 2019, efforts of the Company and Tri-way trying to revitalize Aqua-farm 4 and 5 failed due primarily to the lack of capital
funding to continue to support farms’ developments and the necessity in adding new talents into the existing management teams to carry out the
revitalization works, the Company and Tri-way finally decided to cease operation of Aqua-farm 4 and 5 during September 2019. Again the COVID-
19 Pandemic of 2020 is a complete write-off for AFF 1, 2,and 3 as well as to Tri-way’s sub-contracted farms incurring losses over $77 million for the
year (subjecting to final figures of their respective accounting departments) due completely to the impacts of the pandemic causing all farms to
stop work for over 7 months without sufficient workers, feed, supplementary, medications, transportation and maintenances etc. to keep the live
stocks going and they all died during the period calculating to multiple million pieces (equivalent to multiple of thousand metric tons). It will cost
over $80 million and a minimum of two years to replace said live stocks. As such Tri-way’s current operations are concentrating on rebuilding of
brood stocks, the production of fingerling and nursery stocks and repairing the damages etc. It is anticipating that under current conditions, the
Triway’s fishery operation recovery will be a tall order and will take a long period before recovery.

3. Industry Overview
This section discusses the industry in which the Company operates. Certain of the information in this section relating to market environment,
market developments, growth rates, market trends, industry trends, competition and similar information are estimates based on data compiled by
professional organizations, consultants and analysts, in addition to market data from other external and publicly available sources.
Economic outlook in China
China’s economy is at present second only to that of the United States. Due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic, China's GDP growth was only
2.3%, the slowest pace in more than four decades. Growth has slowed significantly following the COVID19 outbreak in early 2020. Based on the
World Bank’s classification, China has had a remarkable period of rapid growth shifting from a centrally planned to a market based economy.
Today, China is an upper middle-income country that has complex needs for all kinds of consumer goods, including food.
Agriculture in China
Agriculture is a vital industry in China, employing over 300 million farmers. China ranks first in worldwide farm output, primarily producing rice,
wheat, potatoes, tomato, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, cotton, oilseed and soybeans and also the largest consumer of many agricultural
products, such as pork, rice and soybeans. Although accounting for only 10 percent of arable land worldwide, it produces food for 20 percent of the
world's population. While China generally has been successful in meeting its rapidly rising demand for food and grains by increasing domestic
production, it has emerged as a leading global importer of several agricultural commodities, including cotton, soybeans, vegetable oils, and animal
hides. As its domestic agricultural production has grown, China has also become the largest exporter in global markets for several horticultural
products, including mandarin oranges, apples, apple juice, garlic and other vegetables.
China’s increasingly important position in global agricultural markets followed decades of gradual growth in domestic food production and
consumption. After the introduction of market-based reforms in 1978 that included the elimination of the collective production system and
relaxation of government direction over certain farmer production and marketing decisions, Chinese agricultural output grew significantly.
Between 1978 and 2008, China almost doubled its production of grains (rice, wheat and corn) and quadrupled its production of meats; the
production of fruit and milk was about 30 times greater in 2008 than in 1978. During these three decades, population growth of about 1 percent
annually, coupled with annual per capita income growth of eight percent, fueled a large increase in demand for more and higher-value agricultural
products, especially by China’s large and growing middle class. China’s rapid growth in food consumption was largely met by domestic production
growth, enabling it to remain self-sufficient in most major commodities. However, China is also now the world's largest agricultural importer,
surpassing both the European Union (EU) and the United States in 2019 with imports totaling $133.1 billion.
11

China’s support for agriculture
China’s government support for agriculture is low compared to that of developed countries, such as the United States and European Union, but in
line with that of other rapidly growing economies, according to USITC. As measured by the OECD’s PSE1, the amount of support provided to
Chinese farmers was low (and sometimes negative) during the 1990’s, but gradually rose during the period 2008-2010. Compared with other
countries at a similar level of development, including Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa, China’s support for farmers falls in the middle of the
range. China’s PSE reflects changes in the central government’s policy priorities from grain self-sufficiency and low consumer prices toward a
stronger focus on raising farm household incomes, according to USITC. Government support to China’s agricultural sector indicates that Chinese
policymakers are placing a renewed emphasis on the rural economy. Indirect support, in the form of general services, is very high relative to
similar support programs in other countries, due largely to investments in agricultural infrastructure. General services include modern research
and extension services, food safety agencies, and agricultural price information services, most of which provide benefits to producers and
consumers throughout the economy. Compared with direct payments to farmers, general services support is less production-distorting to the
sector.
Agricultural consumption
China is a major global consumer of agricultural products. It consumes one-third of the world’s rice, one-fourth of all corn, and half of all pork and
cotton, and it is the largest consumer of oilseeds and most edible oils. The traditional Chinese diet centers around staple foods (mainly grains and
starches), which account for nearly half of the daily caloric intake. Average Chinese per capita consumption recently stabilized at approximately
3,000 calories per day, one of the highest levels among Asian countries.
Chinese food consumption is influenced by factors such as population size and demographics, income, food prices, and general preferences. Per
capita income growth and urbanization are the two factors most responsible for altering recent consumption patterns in China. Rising income
translates into higher per capita food consumption, while increasing urbanization is driving diversification of food choices because of greater
availability and choice offered through increasingly diverse sales outlets.
Chinese consumers generally fall into one of three categories: rural consumers; urban low-income consumers; or urban high-income consumers.
Although urban high-income consumers can afford to buy more and better-quality food, the ubiquity of food outlets in cities means that nearly every
urban resident, regardless of income, has available an increasingly diverse food selection. Compared to rural diets, urban diets contain less grain
and more non-staple items, including processed and convenience foods. Rural migrants to cities tend to adopt the urban diet.
Expenditure on food
Food is the largest class of household expenditure for all Chinese income groups; even housing takes a smaller share of average household income,
according to USITC. As income rises, the absolute amount of food expenditure increases, although the share of income spent on food falls. Urban
residents spend substantially more on food than their rural counterparts, according to USITC. Higher incomes lead to an increase in both the
quantity and quality of food demanded. However, while demand for higher quantities of food appears to level off in the top income households,
demand for higher-quality foods continues to rise with income.
The market for aquatic products and aquaculture in China
The information in this section regarding aquatic and aquaculture, including graphs, is taken from the USDA’s GAIN Report Number: CH12073 per
12/28/2012 unless otherwise stated.2
1OECD: PSE is defined as the estimated monetary value of transfers from consumers and taxpayers to farmers, expressed as a percentage of gross
farm receipts (defined as the value of total farm production at farmgate prices), plus budgetary support.
2Definition of terms: China’s definition of aquatic products includes both cultured (farm-raised) and wild caught products; aquatic products include
fish, shrimp/prawn/crab, shellfish, algae, and other. Aquatic catch production is total volume of both fresh and seawater wild caught aquatic
products; Aquaculture production is the total volume of both fresh and seawater cultured (farmed) aquatic products. This report will use Chinese
terminology to maintain consistency between Chinese statistics and product categories. Total aquatic trade statistics below do not include fishmeal.
12

Total Aquatic Products Production
China has the world’s largest aquatic production and its market share of the world’s fish production has risen from 7 percent in 1961 to 37 percent
by 2012. China alone accounted for 62.5 percent of the aquaculture production in the world by volume in 2015. Aquaculture represents more than
71.9 percent of the total fish production in China. Total 2015 aquatic production in China increased 4.38 percent to reach 47.9 million tons,
compared to the 45.8 million tons in 2014, per the FAO.
Fish production accounts for 59 percent of the total aquatic production, followed by shellfish and crustaceans at 22.6 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. Fish production is, according to the USDA, expected to continue its upward growth trend to reach 34.5 million tons in 2012, up from
33 million tons in 2011 and 31.3 million tons in 2010.
In 2011, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces profited from favorable coastal locations and abundant freshwater
resources/facilities to rank as the top four aquatic production areas. In terms of freshwater cultured production, Hubei, Guangdong, and Jiangsu
provinces are the largest producers.
According to @2020 undercurrent news, China’s seafood imports increased by 39% to $15bn in 2018. China has the largest aquaculture industry in
the world, accounting for approximately two-thirds of total cultivated aquatic products worldwide. In 2020, output of the Marin culture segment
in China is estimated to total 22.3 million tons, up 4.7% from 2019.
The market for meat in China
China is by far the world’s largest producer and consumer of meat which includes pork, poultry and beef. Historically, this situation did not have a
large impact on the rest of the world, as China, for the most part, maintained self-sufficiency in meat. However, since 2007 the situation has
changed dramatically. China has gradually turned into a net importer of meats. In 2019, China consumed around 28% of the global meat supply.
World meat production was 340 million tons in 2017.3 Global trade in meat is projected to be 20% higher in 2027, representing a slowing down of
meat trade growth to an annual average of 1.5% compared to 2.9% during the previous decade.4 Meat imports into Asia account for 56% of global
trade, and poultry will constitute more than half of this additional import demand. China’s meat production reached 86.60 million tons in 2018,
where total meat production in the United States amounted to 47.06 million tons in 2018.
With strong economic growth and the improvement of living standards, the demand for beef in China is rising.5 China’s animal feed market is
projected to grow at a CAGR of over 16% till 2019.6

6 China Animal Feed Market Forecast and Opportunities, 2019
13

There are several other specific market drivers which underpin the increase in demand for red meat. One driver is the improved living standard in
China which stimulates the growth of beef markets since beef often sells at a much higher price and traditionally has been more expensive than
what most people can afford. Another is the fact that Chinese people’s dietary structure is becoming more diversified and reasonable, bringing
larger amount of beef consumption since beef has nutritional benefits. Lastly, a gradual lowering of import taxes is likely to support sufficient
supply of cattle.
Feed grain prices are projected to remain low during 2018-2027. The year 2017 was affected by numerous outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) around
the world which resulted in a slower increase in world output. China, the second largest producer after the United States, was particularly affected
by several outbreaks over the last years. Thus, China can expect a return to historical trend growth in poultry production from 2018 onwards.
Globally, the share of meat output traded is expected to remain constant at around 10%, with most of the increase in volume coming from poultry
meat. The projected production growth in developing countries remains insufficient to satisfy demand grown, particularly in Asia and Africa. As a
result, import demand is expected to remain strong.7
Market drivers
The improvement of living standard stimulates the growth of beef markets:
Traditionally, Chinese people eat pork and chicken to satisfy their desire for meat. This is largely due to the much higher price of beef which goes
beyond normal people’s affordable level. With the improvement of living standards, Chinese people have begun the upgrade of their consumption of
meat, and began to eat more beef.
Chinese people’s dietary structure becomes more diversified and reasonable, bringing larger amount of beef consumption:
At present, Chinese people are changing their diet patterns to higher and richer nutrition. From a nutritional perspective, beef not only contains
high unsaturated fatty acids and high protein, it also has low fat and lots of nutrition, which makes it perfect for the healthy diet. Thus, in the
future, beef is expected to replace some parts of the market shares in pork, chicken and other meats.8
The market for fertilizer in China
Sales of fertilizers are expected to be supported by healthy expansion of agricultural activities as the amount of sown areas continues to grow and
rural income levels rise. Farmers will continue to register steadily increasing incomes, the result of growing crop prices and government subsidies
designed to supplement their revenues and reduce their material costs. Subsidies aimed directly at cutting the cost of fertilizers is expected to
encourage additional use. In addition, rising crop prices have encouraged farmers to invest in fertilizers to further boost crop yields. Advances will
also be driven by increases in the acreage of sown land dedicated to growing cash crops. However, increasing demand for organic food and
improved understanding of the correct application of fertilizers is expected to prevent demand from rising at a faster pace.

14

In value terms, fertilizer demand is expected to grow from over $195 billion in 2016 to over $245 billion in 2020.9 Faster value growth will be
driven by strong demand for higher value multi-nutrient fertilizers. In addition, advances will be supported by continued growth in fertilizer prices
as the cost of natural gas, oil, coal, and other raw materials continues to increase.
Demand for fertilizer nutrients in China is projected to grow 4.4 percent annually through 2015 to 98.1 million metric tons. Nutrient demand will
be stimulated by increasing use of higher nutrient level products as income levels grow in rural areas in China. In addition, government efforts to
promote multi-nutrient fertilizers will also support gains in fertilizer nutrient demand. Accounting for more than three-fourths of total fertilizer
demand in 2010, single-nutrient fertilizers will remain the larger product type through 2015, despite a relatively low growth rate of 2.1 percent per
year. Sales of single nutrient fertilizers will continue to be supported by their relatively low prices.
The size, growth and composition of fertilizer demand in the six regions that make up China vary considerably. The Central-South and Central-East
will remain the two largest regional fertilizer markets. Due to the comparatively high income levels in the Central-South and Central-East ¨¨which
enable residents to afford more expensive food items ¨ demand for cash crops such as fruits and vegetables will rise in these regions, which in turn
will fuel demand for fertilizer. Sales in the Northeast and Northwest regions will outpace the average through 2015, benefiting from the Great
Western Development Strategy, the Northeast Revitalization Policy, and increasing income levels for farmers.10
In 2006, the central government started a program intended to partially compensate farmers for price increases in fuel, fertilizer and other
agricultural inputs. In the case of fertilizers, government support is part of several separate programs targeting fertilizer producers, with cost
reductions being passed along to farmers purchasing the input.
Fish production accounts for 59 percent of the total aquatic production, followed by shellfish and crustaceans at 22.6 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. Fish production is, according to the USDA, expected to continue its upward growth trend to reach 34.5 million tons in 2012, up from
33 million tons in 2011 and 31.3 million tons in 2010.
In 2011, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces profited from favorable coastal locations and abundant freshwater
resources/facilities to rank as the top four aquatic production areas. In terms of freshwater cultured production, Hubei, Guangdong, and Jiangsu
provinces are the largest producers.
According to @2019 undercurrent news, China’s seafood imports increased by 44% to $12bn in 2018. In the twelve months to the end of December
2018, China imported CNY 787bn worth of seafood, according to Chinese customs data.

World meat production was 323 million tons in 2017.11 Global trade in meat is projected to be 20% higher in 2027, representing a slowing down of
meat trade growth to an annual average of 1.5% compared to 2.9% during the previous decade.12 Meat imports into Asia account for 56% of global
trade, and poultry will constitute more than half of this additional import demand. China’s meat production reached 86.60 million tons in 2018,
where total meat production in the United States amounted to 47.06 million tons in 2018.

4Material Agreements
Joint Venture Agreements
The Company has two types of SFJVCs established under Chinese law:
· Contractual Joint Ventures (“CJV”); and
· Equity Joint Ventures (“EJV”).
Of the five Chinese joint venture project companies which are CJVs or EJVs, four are CJVs (JFD, JHMC, JHST and SJAP) and one is an EJV (HSA).19
The main difference between an EJV and a CJV is that in a CJV, the obligation of capital contribution shall be determined by the contractual parties
themselves. The proportions of capital contribution do not have to be fixed between the Chinese and foreign parties. Profit distribution and risk
sharing ratio shall also be determined by the contracting parties themselves which do not have to be the same proportions as the parties’ capital
contribution or shareholding therein. The capital contributing parties may specify their profit and risk sharing ratio only and may or may not
specify their shareholdings in the CJV. One party may make capital contribution by way of non-monetary assets such as rights in lands, factories
and machineries etc. while the other party may make capital contribution by way of cash.
In an EJV, the shareholders contribute capital and operate business jointly, and share profits, risks and losses in proportion to their equity
contributions. Foreign investor’s capital contribution shall not be less than 25 percent of the total registered capital.
The Company engages in projects based on consulting and service agreements (as described under “Consulting and Services Agreements” below),
whereby the Company can choose whether the cooperation shall continue under a consulting and service agreement or be acquired by the
Company.
Consulting and Services Agreement
Consulting and service (“C&S”) agreements are important for the operation of the Company’s subsidiaries and partners. Only the Company’s
subsidiaries SJAP and HSA do not and have not operated under C&S agreements.
19According to the official documents of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary JHMC, the registered capital of such subsidiary is USD 2 million that
was paid in full by year ended 31 December 2014. As of the date of this Annual Report, MEIJI, a subsidiary of the Company, has contributed USD
400,000 of the subscribed capital, whereas USD 1.6 million of the subscribed capital has not been paid. Moreover, according to the official
documents of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary HSA, the registered capital of such subsidiary is USD 2.5 million and shall be paid in full no later
than 18 July 2013. As of the date of this Annual Report, MEIJI, a subsidiary of the Company, has contributed USD 865,000 of the subscribed capital,
whereas USD 234,500 of the subscribed capital has not been paid by the Chinese owner. The aforementioned deadlines can be re-arranged by all
the promoters. If no new deadline is agreed upon, failure by MEIJI to make full payment may lead to the other promoters making full payment of
the capital contribution on MEIJI’s behalf and requesting MEIJI to compensate for their payment and losses.

Initially, agriculture and aquaculture investors invite the Company to act as a developer and project manager of an agribusiness or food-related
project. If the management of the Company sees the proposal as interesting, the Company carries out an in-depth study of the target company
including legal due diligence, business plan, budget and projected financial information. The Company makes the decision through a resolution of
the Board of Directors. If the Company determines to proceed, the Chinese investor forms a private Chinese company dedicated to the project and
the parties sign a C&S agreement.
The Company acts as the project manager providing turnkey services to the Chinese developer of the project, meaning that the Company builds the
project using its technology, systems, know-how, and management expertise and systems. As such, the Company’s expenditure in the project
includes the Company’s own administration and operational expenses provided for and incurred in the project (charged and recorded under the
Company’s general and administrative operation expenses), which are billed to the Chinese developer. All other development expenditures
(inclusive of the Company’s subcontractors’ and sub-suppliers’ costs and the Company’s marked up profits) are billed to the Chinese developer who
will pay accordingly.
When the C&S Project Company initiates production the Company acts as the sole marketer of food products and as the supplier for the C&S
Project Company under the terms and conditions of the C&S agreement. The Company acts as the selling supplier and buying wholesaler to the
company supplying items such as feed, young cattle, and RAS technological components and buys mature prawns, sleepy cod, eels and live cattle.
The Company earns a gross profit of between 10-15% based on the C&S Project Company’s revenue on this exclusivity.
The C&S Project Company will remain wholly-owned by the Chinese developer until the Company exercises the acquisition option and subsequently
converts the company into an SFJVC where the Chinese investor remains as a minority shareholder. The acquisition price is normally determined in
accordance with the book value of the Chinese company as of the acquisition date. Consideration will normally consist partly of cash and partly of
project loans owed by the Chinese investor, which offset and decrease the purchase proceeds in the corresponding amount. Generally, the
agreements that the Company has entered into governing the formation of the unincorporated companies into SFJVCs do not regulate the maturity
date for the formation of SFJVC. The date for the formation of the SFJVC is generally left to the discretion of the Company, based on the
development and profitability of the relevant project.
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has entered into ten C&S agreements. A portion of the C&S agreements contain an acquisition
premium clause, in which the accumulated C&S project development fees billed by the Company will be paid in addition to the equity book value at
the time of acquisition. In the event that either of the investors decides to sell all or part of its equity in the SFJVC to any third party, a portion of
the agreements require the selling investor to obtain prior consent of the other investor before such sale and to grant the right of first refusal to the
other investor on the like terms for the intended sale.
As of October 1, 2016, when Tri-way became the developer and operator of all fishery C&S Projects formerly under SIAF, CA’s new role is one of
turnkey operator appointed by and working on behalf of Tri-way.
Land leases
Private ownership of land is not permitted in China. Therefore, the Company leases land that is either collectively owned land or state owned land,
through land use rights. Corporate entities and individuals may own the property (buildings) erected on the land.
19

Land use rights may be transferred, but they are based on agricultural contracts and cannot be changed arbitrarily to non-agricultural purposes.
The lease term varies from 27 to 60 years. There are certain uncertainties (e.g., lease term may not exceed 30 years and all transfers have not yet
been registered correctly) in respect of certain leased land due to the fact that not all requirements have been fulfilled or not yet registered.
However, the Company believes it is protected against these uncertainties through its agreements with the relevant local Chinese partners and
relevant registration processes have been initiated. The Company’s subsidiary HSA has acquired land use rights for state owned land located in
OuChi Village, FengHuo Town, LinLi County, Hunan Province. However, HSA has not obtained a land use right certificate for such land, which
therefore, for the time being, cannot be lawfully mortgaged or transferred. Moreover, the Company’s subsidiary CA has entered into a Rural Land
Management Rights Sub-Sales Agreement for the acquisition of the contractual operating and use rights of 202 mu of collective owned land located
in Da San Dui Wei You Nan Village, Shenwan Town, Zhongshan City for a period of 30 years. However, the transfer procedures for the land in
question have not been completed. CA is not an enterprise registered in mainland China and therefore, according to Chinese law, cannot acquire
the contractual operating and use rights of collective owned land. The Company is currently negotiating with Beijing Hengxintianyi Investment
Guarantee Co. Ltd. to designate a subsidiary of the Company in China for the purpose of entering into a new Rural Land Management Rights Sub-
Sales Agreement.
License Rights
Through the past 10 years (from 2007 to present) the Company has improved and modified the Recirculating Aquaculture System (“RAS”)
originally pioneered in Germany into a unique system designed for indoor systems referred to as A Power Module (“APM indoor”) and an outdoor
module called open dam RAS (“ODRAS”). We provide two types of licenses under this technology namely, a Developer License permitting a fishery
project license to utilize the technology in its design of the APM indoor or ODRAS farms, and an Operator license permitting the use of APM-indoor
or ODRAS technology at their respective farms. Each license is granted a 50-year term per assigned module unit for a one-time fee of $50,000 per
license, that is a $50,000 fee for rights to the Developer license and a $50,000 fee for rights to the Operator license for 50 years per developed
module.
On November 12, 2008, the Company’s subsidiary TRW entered into an agreement with the inventor of a patent, Mr. Shan Dezhang, concerning the
sale and purchase of the master license rights of a patent registered in China with patent number ZL200510063039.9.
On May 15, 2009, Tri-way (as licensor) entered into a sub-license agreement with SJAP (as licensee) concerning the sub-licensing of the above-
mentioned patent (ZL200510063039.9). For further information on the aforementioned agreements, please refer to the section entitled
“Intellectual Property Rights” above.
5. Government regulation:
Regulation of M&A and Overseas Listings
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce (the “MOFCOM”), the State Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”), the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (the “SAIC”), the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”), jointly issued the Regulations
on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and
was amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for
purposes of the overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain
the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.
On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official Website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose
vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC. The application of this new PRC regulation
remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval
requirement.
20

The M&A Rules also establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more
time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control
transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise.
In February 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and
Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (“Circular 6”), which established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions
of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors
having “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire “de facto control” of
domestic enterprises with “national security” concerns. In August 2011, the MOFCOM promulgated the Rules on Implementation of Security
Review System (the “MOFCOM Security Review Rules”), to replace the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on Matters Relating to
the Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by the
MOFCOM in March 2011. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, which came into effect on September 1, 2011, provide that the MOFCOM will look
into the substance and actual impact of a transaction and prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring
transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions.
On October 23, 2019, the SAFE issued the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange to Further the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade
and Investment, which cancelled restrictions on the use by foreign-invested companies that are not investment companies of their capital funds for
equity investments.
Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (the “FX
Regulations”), which were last amended in August 2008. Under the FX Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items,
including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account
items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the
SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. On August 29, 2008, the SAFE issued a notice, Circular 142, regulating the
conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires
that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within
the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, the
SAFE increased its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign
currencies. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without the SAFE’s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if
the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines. As a result, Circular
142 may significantly limit our ability to transfer cash or other assets from The Company and/or our other non-PRC subsidiaries into our
subsidiaries in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business expansion and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds into RMB to invest
in or acquire any other PRC companies, or establish other variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in the PRC.
21

Dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas shareholder are deemed income of the shareholder and are taxable in the PRC. Pursuant to the
Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase or
remit foreign currency, subject to a cap approved by the SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of the SAFE.
Foreign currency transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE
and other relevant PRC governmental authorities.
In October 2005, the SAFE promulgated the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Corporate Financing
and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (“Circular 75”). Under Circular 75, which was issued by SAFE effective
November 1, 2005, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for
the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to the
registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore
enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the
capital of the offshore company. Moreover, Circular 75 applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who, prior to November 1, 2005, had
established or acquired control of offshore companies that had made onshore investments in the PRC prior to were required to complete the
relevant registration procedures with the local SAFE branch by March 31, 2006.
Since May 2007, the SAFE has issued a series of guidance to its local branches with respect to the operational process for the SAFE registration
under Circular 75. The guidance provides more specific and stringent supervision of the registration required by Circular 75. For example, the
guidance imposes obligations on onshore subsidiaries of an offshore entity to make true and accurate statements to the local SAFE authorities
regarding any shareholder or beneficial owner of the offshore entity who is a PRC citizen or resident. Untrue statements by the onshore
subsidiaries will lead to potential liability for the subsidiaries and, in some instances, for their legal representatives and other related individuals.
Under the relevant rules, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the
foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including increases in its registered capital, payment of dividends and other
distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and capital inflows from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties
under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. PRC residents who control our company from time to time are required to register with
the SAFE in connection with their investments in us.
On December 25, 2006, the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”) issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control and
related Implementation Rules were issued by the SAFE on January 5, 2007. Both became effective on February 1, 2007. Under these regulations,
all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan, or similar plan participated in by onshore
individuals may be conducted only with approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign
Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company (“Offshore Share Incentives
Rules”), which was issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted
shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and to comply with a series of other
requirements. If we, or the PRC employees of ours who hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares fail to comply with these
registration or other procedural requirements, we, and/or such employees may be subject to fines and other legal sanctions.
22

The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986),
which was amended in October 2000, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001). Under these regulations,
foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC
accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their
accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the
enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which
became effective as of January 1, 2008, and was amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide
written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law
and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the
implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one
month after its implementation.
On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into
effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
As of December 31, 2020, we had entered written employment contracts with three of our employees.
Income Tax
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress approved and promulgated the Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”). On December 6,
2007, the State Council approved the Implementing Rules. Both the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules became effective on January 1, 2008.
Under the EIT Law and the Implementing Rules, which superseded the previous Income Tax Law, the enterprise income tax rate for both domestic
companies and foreign invested enterprises is unified at 25%. On December 26, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Circular on
Implementation of Enterprise Tax Transition Preferential Policy, or the Preferential Policy Circular. The EIT Law, its Implementing Rules and the
Preferential Policy Circular provide a five-year transitional period for certain entities that had enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25%
under the previous Income Tax Law and were established before March 16, 2007, during which period the applicable enterprises income tax rate
shall gradually increase to 25%.
On April 14, 2008, the Administration Measures for Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises, or the Recognition Measures, were
jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Finance, and the SAT, which sets out the standards and process for
granting the high and new technology enterprises status. According to the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules as well as the Recognition
Measures, enterprises which have been granted the high and new technology enterprises status shall enjoy a favorable income tax rate of 15%. The
new EIT Law and its Implementation Rules also provide that “software enterprises” enjoy a two-year income tax exemption starting from the first
profit making year, followed by a reduced tax rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years.
23

The EIT Law also provides that an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign country or region but whose “de facto management body” is in
the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its
global income. The Implementing Rules merely defines the location of the “de facto management body” as “the place where the exercising, in
substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC
company is located.” The SAT issued the Circular regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax
Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria
for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. The SAT
issued the Bulletin regarding the Administrative Measures on the Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises
(Interim) on July 27, 2011, which became effective on September 1, 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This
bulletin clarifies matters including resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although both
Circular 82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not companies like us, the determining criteria set
forth in Circular 82 and the bulletin may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in
determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Based on a
review of surrounding facts and circumstances, the Company does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be
considered a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history of the EIT Law, should the
Company be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax
rate of 25% retroactive to January 1, 2008.
The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a Foreign Invested Enterprise (an “FIE”) to its immediate
holding company outside of China if such immediate holding company is considered a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place
within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China,
unless such immediate holding company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding
arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the previous law. The State of Nevada, where the Company is incorporated, does
not have such tax treaty with China. The SAT further promulgated a circular, or Circular 601, on October 27, 2009, which provides that the tax
treaty benefits will be denied to “conduit” or shell companies without business substance and that a beneficial ownership analysis will be used
based on a “substance-over-form” principle to determine whether to grant the tax treaty benefits. Most our subsidiaries in China are directly held
by our non-Chinese subsidiaries. If we are regarded as a non-resident enterprise and our non-Chinese subsidiaries are regarded as resident
enterprises, then our non-Chinese subsidiaries may be required to pay a 10% withholding tax on any dividends payable to us. If our non-Chinese
subsidiaries are regarded as non-resident enterprises, then our PRC subsidiaries may be required to pay a 5% withholding tax for any dividends
payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, however, it is still unclear at this stage whether Circular 601 applies to dividends from our PRC
subsidiaries paid to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, and if our non-Chinese subsidiaries were not considered as “beneficial owners” of any dividends
from their PRC subsidiaries, whether the dividends payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%.
The EIT Law and its Implementation Rules have tried to scrutinize transactions between related parties. Pursuant to the EIT Law and its
Implementation Rules, the tax authorities may impose mandatory adjustment on tax due to the extent a related party transaction is not in line with
arm’s-length principle or was entered with a purpose to reduce, avoid or delay the payment of tax. On January 8, 2009, the SAT issued the
Implementation Measures for Special Tax Adjustments (Trial), which clarifies the definition of “related party” and sets forth the tax-filing disclosure
and documentation requirements, the selection and application of transfer pricing methods, and transfer pricing investigation and assessment
procedures.
24

On December 10, 2009, the SAT issued a circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax Collection on Income Derived from
Equity Transfer by Non-resident Enterprise, or Circular 698. Pursuant to Circular 698, non-resident enterprises should declare any direct transfer
of equity interest of PRC resident enterprises and pay taxes in accordance with the EIT Law and relevant laws and regulations. For an indirect
transfer, if the effective tax rate for the transferor (a non-PRC-resident enterprise) is lower than 12.5% under the law of the jurisdiction of the
direct transferred target, the transferor is required to submit relevant transaction materials to PRC tax authorities for review. If such indirect
transfer is determined by PRC tax authorities to be a transaction without any reasonable business purpose other than for tax avoidance, the gains
derived from such transfer will be subject to PRC income tax.
On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued a Public Notice [2015] No. 7, or Public Notice 7, to supersede existing provisions in relation to the
Indirect Transfer as set forth in Circular 698, while the other provisions of Circular 698 remain in force. Public Notice 7 introduces a new tax
regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Public Notice extends its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfer as
set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of immovable property in China and assets held under the establishment and
place in China of a foreign company through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Public Notice 7 also addresses the
transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company widely. In addition, Public Notice 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular
698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings. However,
it also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they have to make self-assessment on whether the
transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.
The PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 to make adjustments to the taxable
capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the equity interests transferred and the cost of investment. We may pursue
acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise
Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and
Public Notice 7, our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.
6. RISK FACTORS.
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information in
this Annual Report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and our future growth prospects would suffer. Under these circumstances, the share price and value of our common stock could decline
and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report are the only material risks and
uncertainties that we presently know to be facing our company.
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements anticipate future events or future financial performance. This
Annual Report also contains market data related to our business and industry. This market data includes projections that are based on a number of
assumptions. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from projections based on them. As a result, our markets may
not grow at the rates projected by these data, or at all. The failure of these markets to grow at these projected rates may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.
25

Currently, we conduct our business operations in the People’s Republic of China. As China’s economy and its laws, regulations and policies may and
do differ from those found in the West, and change continually, we face certain risks that are summarized in this section.
Risks Related to Our Company
Subsequent to the Tri-way carve-out, the number of direct major customers associated with SIAF subsidiaries has been reduced.
Subsequent to the Tri-way carve-out, the number of direct major customers associated with SIAF subsidiaries has been reduced, with the
concentration of major customers now handled through the SJAP and SIAF/CA’s import/export trading division (the “Corporate Division”) via its
main distribution agent, Shanghai Virgo Trading Co. Ltd. (“Virgo”) such that a loss of business with Virgo will have an adverse effect on SIAF’s
Corporate Division operational performance. The Corporate Division accounted for 8.2% of consolidated revenues during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2018.
We may be unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, and as a result we may be unable to
accurately report our financial results.
Our reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems. If we
fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we could experience delays or inaccuracies in reporting our financial
information, or non-compliance with SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. This could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and result in a
loss of public confidence in our management, which could, among other things, cause our stock price to drop.
Because we will require additional financing to expand our vertically integrated operations according to our business plan and
growth strategy, our failure to obtain necessary financing will impair our growth strategy; in addition, the risks of vertical integration
are significant.
As of December 31, 2018, we had net working capital of $175,208,848, including cash and cash equivalents of $4,950,799. Our capital
requirements to accomplish our planned vertically integrated development and growth plan of our business are significant.
In most developed countries, risks of agriculture operations are shared to a certain degree by different sectors in the industry. For example:
· Research and development are often initiated and supported by government departments;
· Primary producers are mainly concerned with the growing risks of the produce;
· Marketing companies assume the risks of marketing the produce;
· Trading houses sell the produce and assume the credit risks of the sales; and
· Logistics companies assume the risks of transporting the produce.
However, as a vertically integrated operator, we must assume all the above-mentioned risks. China is a developing country; compared to other
developed nations, its agriculture industry is not modern. Thus, management believes that it is essential for us to develop our business operation in
a vertically integrated manner so that we can achieve reasonable profit margins for our products. We believe that the multiple layers of profits
generated through vertical integration may compensate to some degree for the variety of risks that we face through the multiple operations;
however, the overall risks are much greater. At the same time, our five year plan for vertically integrated developments is not fully completed, and
the remaining developments may require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these vertically
integrated developments could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.
26

To accomplish the objectives discussed above and to execute our business strategy, we need access to capital on appropriate terms. We currently
have no commitments with any third party to obtain such additional financing and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the requisite
additional financing on any terms and, if we are able to raise additional funds, it may be necessary for us to sell our securities at a price which is at
a significant discount from the market price and on other terms which may be disadvantageous to us. In connection with any such financing, we
may be required to provide registration rights to the investors and pay damages to the investors in the event that the registration statement is not
filed or declared effective by specified dates. The price and terms of any financing which would be available to us could result in both the issuance
of a significant number of shares and significant downward pressure on our stock price. We cannot assure you that our business objectives,
particularly over the longer term, will be met on a timely basis, if at all. Consequently, we may be unable to meet fixed obligations and expenses
that will be generated in the operation of our business, whether as presently in existence or as proposed. Any failure to obtain requisite financing
on acceptable terms could have material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects.
No assurance of successful expansion of operations.
Our significant increase in the scope and the scale of our operations, including the hiring of additional personnel, has resulted in significantly
higher operating expenses. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase. Expansion of our operations may also make
significant demands on our management, finances and other resources. Our ability to manage the anticipated future growth, should it occur, will
depend upon a significant expansion of our accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation and subsequent
improvement of a variety of systems, procedures and controls. We cannot assure that significant problems in these areas will not occur. Failure to
expand these areas and implement and improve such systems, procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with our
business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that attempts to
expand our marketing, sales, manufacturing and customer support efforts will succeed or generate additional sales or profits in any future period.
As a result of the expansion of our operations and the anticipated increase in our operating expenses, along with the difficulty in forecasting
revenue levels, we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations.
We may be unable to successfully expand our production capacity, which could result in material delays, quality issues, increased
costs and loss of business opportunities, which may negatively impact our product margins and profitability.
Part of our future growth strategy is to increase our production capacity to meet increasing demand for our goods. Assuming we obtain sufficient
funding to increase our production capacity, any projects to increase such capacity may not be constructed on the anticipated timetable or within
budget. We may also experience quality control issues as we implement any production upgrades. Any material delay in completing these projects,
or any substantial cost increases or quality issues in connection with these projects could materially delay our ability to bring our products to
market and adversely affect our business, reduce our revenue, income and available cash, all of which could harm our financial condition.
27

Our business and operations are growing rapidly. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results
could be harmed.
We have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our operations. This has placed, and may continue to place, significant
demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and
services could suffer, which could negatively affect our operating results. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our
operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. These systems improvements may require significant
capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our
financial position.
If the Chinese government were to change its presently favorable policy toward the agriculture industry, we would no longer enjoy
our present tax-related privileges, which would materially and adversely impact our sales performance, margins, and net profit and
our costs structure.
As producers active in the agriculture industry, our subsidiaries are presently exempt from income tax and enjoy various incentive grants and
subsidies given by the Chinese government. If the Chinese government were to change its presently favorable policy toward the agriculture
industry, we would no longer enjoy our present tax-related privileges, which would materially and adversely impact our sales performance,
margins, and net profit and our costs structure. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, quick changes of policies by the Chinese
government. If we do not effectively and efficiently manage our growth on time due to lack of capital, we could suffer adversely from the
consequences of any such policy changes.
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to adequately protect, or uncertainty regarding validity, enforceability
or scope of them could undermine our competitive position and reduce the value of our products, services and brand, and litigation to
protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.
We attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements. As a
result, our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets to us. Various events outside of
our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property
protection may not be available in China and other countries in which our products are sold. Also, although we have registered our trademark in
China, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights
could harm our business or our ability to compete and hurt our results of operation. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and
time consuming. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect
our intellectual property rights. But due to the relative unpredictability of the Chinese legal system and potential difficulties to enforce a court’s
judgment in China, there is no guarantee that litigation would result in a favorable outcome. Furthermore, any such litigation may be costly and
may divert our management’s attention from our core business. An adverse determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely
to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation. Although we are not aware of any of such litigation, we have no insurance coverage against
the litigation costs so we would be forced to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties. All foregoing factors could harm
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us
to do business and harm our operating results.
28

We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined against us, could adversely
affect our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties.
Our success mainly depends on our ability to use and develop our technology and product designs without infringing upon the intellectual property
rights of third parties. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violations of other intellectual property rights of
third parties. Holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our product offerings may be unknown to us, which
may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms. There may also be technologies licensed to us and that we rely
upon that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such
technologies. In addition, although we endeavor to ensure that companies that work with us possess appropriate intellectual property rights or
licenses, we cannot fully avoid the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of components used in our products or by
companies we work with in cooperative research and development activities. Our current or potential competitors may have obtained or may obtain
patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. The defense of intellectual property claims, including
patent infringement suits, and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming, and may significantly divert the
efforts and resources of our technical personnel and management. These factors could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our
business operations and result in our customers or potential customers deferring, canceling or limiting their purchase or use of our products, which
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We rely on highly skilled personnel and the continuing efforts of our executive officers and, if we are unable to retain, motivate or
hire qualified personnel, our business may be severely disrupted.
Our performance largely depends on the talents, knowledge, skills, know-how and efforts of highly skilled individuals and in particular, the
expertise held by our chief executive officer, Solomon Lee. His absence, were it to occur, could impact development and implementation of our
projects and businesses. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel
for all areas of our organization. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new technology developers and to
retain and motivate our existing contractors. If one or more of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions,
we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Therefore, our business may be severely disrupted, and we may incur additional expenses to
recruit and retain new officers. In addition, if any of our executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some customers.
Our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other
catastrophes.
Our financial and operating performance may be affected adversely by epidemics, bad weather conditions, natural disasters and other
catastrophes. Our HU plantation and Mega Farm is situated in Enping district and Zhongshan district which are subject to flooding, especially
during the typhoon season (from July through September); for examples we lost many live fish and prawns grown in our open dam area of 450 Mu
at the Zhongshan Mage Farm due to flooding in 2017 and again the same farm lost most of its fish breed stocks due to power stoppage caused by
the typhoon; meanwhile, at Enping’s HU Plantation we lost all the winter cash crops planted during August 2018 and 50 Mu of nursery herbal tea
plants and 200 Mu of passion fruit tree planted during Q2 2018.
We do not expect to encounter any epidemics in our aquaculture fishery farms in districts of the Guangdong Province or cattle farms in Huangyuan
District of the Qinghai Province. However in the event of epidemics, we expect that our marine animals and our cattle will be quarantined until
such time as a sanitary certificate for clean bill of health is obtained, before any of our products will be sold. In an extreme situation where our
products would fail to obtain the sanitary certificate, they will be destroyed subject to the direction of the Inspection Authorities of the Agriculture
Department of China. There is compensation granted by the Chinese government for the destruction of our products but only for a fraction of our
cost of production; as such the Company will bear virtually all losses under such circumstances.
If we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.
Although we have no present plans for any specific acquisitions, in the event that we make acquisitions, we could have difficulty integrating the
acquired companies’ personnel and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for
us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the
negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks
described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:
29

· difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;
· potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;
· difficulty of incorporating acquired rights or products into our existing business;
· difficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities;
· difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
· potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;
· potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and
existing customers;
· effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;
· potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool,
reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from
actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition.
Our business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems
encountered in connection with these acquisitions, many of which cannot be presently identified, these risks and problems could disrupt our
ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.
We face significant competition, including changes in pricing.
The markets for our products are both competitive and price sensitive. Many competitors have significant financial, operations, sales and marketing
resources, plus experience in research and development, and compete with us by offering lower prices. Competitors could develop new
technologies that compete with our products to achieve a lower unit price. If a competitor develops lower cost superior technology or cost-effective
alternatives to our products and services, our business could be seriously harmed.
The markets for some of our products are also subject to specific competitive risks because these markets are highly price competitive. Our
competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. If they do so again, we may be forced to respond by lowering our
prices. This would reduce sales revenues and increase losses. Failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may also impact sales and
aggravate losses.
Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do.
Our products compete and will compete with similar if not identical products produced by our competitors. These competitive products could be
marketed by well-established, successful companies that possess greater financial, marketing, distribution personnel, and other resources than we
do. Using said resources, these companies can implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to
specific marketing efforts by competitors. They can introduce new products to new markets more rapidly. In certain instances, competitors with
greater financial resources may be able to enter a market in direct competition with us, offering attractive marketing tools to encourage the sale of
products that compete with our products or present cost features that consumers may find attractive.

Risks Related to our Industry
Our agricultural assets are situated in three provinces in China and crop disease, severe weather, natural disasters and other
conditions affecting the environment, including the effects of climate change, could result in substantial losses and weaken our
financial condition.
Our agricultural operations are situated in Qinghai Province, Hunan and Guangdong Province. Qinghai Province in particular is subject to
occasional periods of drought. Crops require water in different quantities at different times during the growth cycle. The limited water resource at
any given point can adversely impact production. In Qinghai our cropping and pasture land presently comprises over 5,000 acres, an area too big
and too costly to afford drip irrigation systems for our crops. In Hunan, the district of Linli where we have over 300 acres of crop and pasture land
may from time to time be subject to flooding that could affect our agriculture production. In Enping, Guangdong, our HU Plants are very
susceptible to dry and wet seasonal variation that could also affect our agriculture production.
Crop disease, severe weather conditions, such as floods, droughts, windstorms and hurricanes, and natural disasters, may adversely affect our
supply of one or more products, reduce our sales volumes, increase our unit production costs or prevent or impair our ability to ship products as
planned. Since a significant portion of our costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year, volume declines due to production
interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs, which could result in substantial losses and weaken our financial
condition. We may experience crop disease, insect infestation, severe weather and other adverse environmental conditions from time to time.
Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change.
An occurrence of such an event might result in material disruptions to our operations, to the operations of our customers or suppliers, resulting in a
decline in the agriculture industry. There can be no assurance that our facilities or products will not be affected by any such occurrence in the
future, which occurrence may lead to adverse conditions to our operations and financial results.
Prices of agricultural products are subject to supply and demand, a market condition which is not predictable.
Because our agricultural products are commodities, we are not able to predict with certainty what price we will receive for our products.
Additionally, the growth cycle of such products in many instances dictates when such products must be marketed to achieve the maximum
profitability. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices throughout the industry affected. Conversely, shortages
may drive the prices higher. Shortages often result from adverse growing conditions which can reduce the availability of the agricultural products
affected. Since multiple variables can affect supply and demand, we cannot accurately predict or control from year to year what prices, either
favorable or unfavorable, it will receive from the market.
In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand
and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other
reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand
for our products. However, even if market prices are unfavorable, some of our agricultural products which are ready to be, or have been, harvested
must be brought to market promptly. A decrease in the selling price received for our products due to the factors described above could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
31

We could realize losses and suffer liquidity problems due to declines in sales prices for our agriculture products.
Sales prices for agricultural products are difficult to predict. It is possible that sales prices for our products will decline in the future, and sales
prices for other agricultural products may also decline. In recent years, there has been increasing consolidation among food retailers, wholesalers
and distributors. A significant portion of our costs is fixed, so that fluctuations in the sales prices have an immediate impact on our profitability. Our
profitability is also affected by our production costs, which may increase due to factors beyond our control.
We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.
The sales of our products may involve the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized personnel, product
contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, or residues introduced during the growing, packing,
storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all
material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including internal product safety policies, we cannot be sure that consumption of our
products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a
product liability claim is unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely
affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image. We do not maintain product liability insurance.
We may not be successful in the implementation of our new technologies and new products, and our new products may not be widely
accepted.
Our new technologies such as our drip irrigation system for precision agriculture or the introduction, testing and promotion of new agricultural
varieties, must be able to adapt to local conditions. The term “drip irrigation” refers to a system whereby the exact amount of water is supplied to
the plants’ roots at the correct moment. On the one hand, there exists the failure risk due to not being suitable for the local environment and
market conditions; on the other hand, there are risks of loss of competitive advantages due to the rising of producing similar products enterprises
and other enterprises that follow to produce the similar products.
We are a holding company whose subsidiaries are given certain degree of independence and our failure to integrate our subsidiaries
may adversely affect our financial condition.
According to the specific characteristics of agricultural production in China, we have given our subsidiary companies and their farms a certain
degree of independency in decision-making. On one hand, this independency increases the sense of ownership at all levels, on the other hand it has
also increased the difficulty of the integration of operation and management, which has resulted in increased difficulty of management integration.
In the event we are not able to successfully manage our subsidiaries this will result in operating difficulties and have a negative impact on our
business.
32

One or more distributors could engage in activities that harm our brand and our business.
Our products are sold primarily through distributors, who are responsible for ensuring that our products have the appropriate licenses to be sold to
farmers in their provinces, and are stored at the correct temperature to ensure freshness and meet shelf life terms. If distributors do not obtain the
appropriate licenses, their sales of our products in those provinces may be illegal, and we may be subject to government sanctions, including
confiscation of illegal revenues and a fine of between two and three times the amount of such illegal revenues. Unlicensed sales in a province may
also cause a delay for our other distributors in receiving a license from the authorities for their provinces, which could further adversely impact our
sales. In addition, distributors may sell our products under another brand licensed in a particular province if our product is not licensed there. If
our products are sold under another brand, the purchasers will not be aware of our brand name, and we will be unable to cross-market other seed
varieties or other products as effectively to these purchasers. Moreover, our ability to provide appropriate customer service to these purchasers
will be negatively affected, and we may be unable to develop our local knowledge of the needs of these purchasers and their environment.
Furthermore, if any of our distributors sell inferior seeds produced by other companies under our brand name, our brand and reputation could be
harmed, which could make marketing of our branded seeds more difficult. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of the occurrence
of any of the potential violations by our distributors described above.
The PRC agricultural market is highly competitive and our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are
unable to compete effectively.
The agricultural market in China is highly fragmented, largely regional and highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase and intensify
within the sector. We face significant competition in our lines of business. Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and
development and other resources than we have. Competition may also develop from consolidation within our industry in China or the privatization
of producers that are currently operated by local governments in China. Our competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry
consolidation and acquisition opportunities than we are. The reform and restructuring of state-owned equity in enterprises involved primarily in
producing sectors will likely lead to the reallocation of market share in the agriculture industry, and our competitors may increase their market
share by participating in the restructuring of state-owned agriculture companies. Such privatization would likely result in increased numbers of
market participants with more efficient and commercially viable business models. As competition intensifies, our margins may be compressed by
more competitive pricing and we may lose our market share and experience a reduction in our revenues and profit.
We may not possess all of the licenses required to operate our business, or we may fail to maintain the licenses we currently hold.
This could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
We are required to hold a variety of permits and licenses to conduct business in China. We may not possess all of the permits and licenses required
for each of our business segments. In addition, the approvals, permits or licenses required by governmental agencies may change without
substantial advance notice, and we could fail to obtain the approvals, permits or licenses required to expand our business. If we fail to obtain or to
maintain such permits or licenses, or if renewals are granted with onerous conditions, we could be subject to fines and other penalties and be
limited in the number or the quality of the products that we could offer. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Related to Doing Business in China
Under PRC law, we are required to obtain and retain permits and business licenses, and our failure to do so would adversely impact
our ability to conduct business in China.
We hold various permits, business licenses, and approvals authorizing our operations and activities, which are subject to periodic review and
reassessment by the Chinese authorities. Standards of compliance necessary to pass such reviews change from time to time and differ from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, leading to a degree of uncertainty. If renewals, or new permits, business licenses or approvals required in connection
with existing or new facilities or activities, are not granted or are delayed, or if existing permits, business licenses or approvals are revoked or
substantially modified, we may not be able to continue to operate our facilities which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. If new
standards are applied to renewals or new applications, it could prove costly for us to meet these new standards.
33

The PRC economic cycle may negatively impact our operating results.
We believe that the rapid growth of the PRC economy before 2008 generally led to higher levels of inflation. We believe that the PRC economy has
more recently experienced a decrease in its growth rate. We believe that a number of factors have contributed to this deceleration, including
appreciation of the RMB, the currency of China, which has adversely affected China’s exports. In addition, we believe the deceleration has been
exacerbated by the recent global crisis in the financial services and credit markets, which has resulted in significant volatility and dislocation in the
global capital markets. It is uncertain how long the global crisis in the financial services and credit markets will continue and the significance of the
adverse impact it may have on the global economy in general or the Chinese economy in particular. Slowing economic growth in China could result
in weakening growth and demand for our products, which could reduce our revenues and income. In the event of a recovery in the PRC, renewed
high growth levels may again lead to inflation. The government’s attempts to control inflation may adversely affect the business climate and growth
of private enterprise. In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected if prices for our products rise at a rate that is insufficient to
compensate for the rise in inflation.
Currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business, including limiting our ability to
convert Chinese Renminbi (RMB) into foreign currencies and, if the RMB were to decline in value, reducing our revenue in U.S.
dollar terms.
The exchange rate of the RMB is currently managed by the Chinese government. On July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank of China, with the
authorization of the State Council of the PRC, announced that the RMB exchange rate would no longer be pegged to the U.S. Dollar and would float
based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. According to public reports, the governor of the People’s Bank has
stated that the basket is composed mainly of the U.S. Dollar, the European Union Euro, the Japanese Yen and the South Korean Won. Also
considered, but playing smaller roles, are the currencies of Singapore, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Russia, Australia, Canada and Thailand. The
weight of each currency within the basket has not been announced.
The initial adjustment of the RMB exchange rate was an approximate 2% revaluation from an exchange rate of 8.28 RMB per U.S. Dollar to 8.11
RMB per U.S. Dollar. The People’s Bank announced that the daily trading price of the U.S. Dollar against the RMB in the inter-bank foreign
exchange market would float within a band of 0.3% around the central parity published by the People’s Bank, while trading prices of non-U.S.
Dollar currencies against the RMB would be allowed to move within a certain band announced by the People’s Bank. The People’s Bank has stated
that it will make adjustments of the RMB exchange rate band when necessary according to market developments as well as the economic and
financial situation. In a later announcement published on May 18, 2007, the band was extended to 0.5%. Since July 2008, the RMB has traded at
6.83 RMB per U.S. Dollar. Recent reports indicate an upward revaluation in the value of the RMB against the U.S. Dollar may be allowed. The
People’s Bank announced on June 19, 2010 its intention to allow the RMB to move more freely against the basket of currencies, which increases the
possibility of sharp fluctuations in the value of the RMB in the near future and thus the unpredictability associated with the RMB exchange rate.
However the RMB in 2018 is very sensitive to and influenced by its political situation with USA illustrated by its multiple changes in depreciation
and appreciation against the US$ during the past year.
Despite this change in its exchange rate regime, the Chinese government continues to manage the valuation of the RMB. The value of our common
stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the
RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our
business or results of operations.
34

The income statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the
U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue,
operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the
translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our
international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries’
financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In
addition, we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency. Changes in
the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss.
Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into
any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may
be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC
exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.
Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us and we may have limited legal recourse under PRC law if
disputes arise under our contracts with third parties.
Since 1979, we believe PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in
China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all
aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretation and enforcement of
these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some
of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, sometimes we may not be aware of our
violation of these policies and rules until sometime after violation.
The Chinese government has enacted laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign
investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is
limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. The resolution of these matters may be
subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular
matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under PRC law, in
either of these cases, are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent
these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
Under the PRC EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of the PRC. Such classification could result in tax
consequences to the Company or our non-PRC resident shareholders.
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress approved and promulgated a new tax law, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or “EIT Law,”
which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. An
enterprise established outside of China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it can
be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define “de facto
management bodies” as a managing body that in practice exercises “substantial and overall management and control over the production and
operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the enterprise; however, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would deem our
managing body as being located within China. Due to the short history of the EIT Law and lack of applicable legal precedents, the PRC tax
authorities determine the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company on a case-by-case basis.
35

If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax
consequences could follow. First, we could be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25 percent on our worldwide taxable income, as well
as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Second, under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid between “qualified
resident enterprises” are exempt from enterprise income tax. As a result, if we are treated as a PRC “qualified resident enterprise,” all dividends
paid from our Chinese subsidiaries to us would be exempt from PRC tax.
Finally, the new “resident enterprise” classification could result in a situation in which a 10% PRC tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-
PRC stockholders that are not PRC tax “resident enterprises” and gains derived by hem from transferring our common stock, if such income is
considered PRC-sourced income by the relevant PRC authorities. In such event, we may be required to withhold a 10% PRC tax on any dividends
paid to non-PRC resident stockholders. Our non-PRC resident stockholders also may be responsible for paying PRC tax at a rate of 10% on any gain
realized from the sale or transfer of our common stock in certain circumstances. We would not, however, have an obligation to withhold PRC tax
with respect to such gain.
Moreover, the SAT released Circular Guoshuihan No. 698 (“Circular 698”) on December 15, 2009 that reinforces the taxation of non-listed equity
transfers by non-resident enterprises through overseas holding vehicles. Circular 698 addresses indirect share transfers as well as other issues.
Circular 698 is retroactively effective from January 1, 2008. According to Circular 698, where a foreigner (non-PRC resident) who indirectly holds
shares in a PRC resident enterprise through a non-PRC offshore holding company indirectly transfers equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise
by selling the shares of the offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country or jurisdiction where the effective tax burden is less
than 12.5 percent or where the offshore income of his, her, or its residents is not taxable, the foreign investor is required to provide the PRC tax
authority in charge of that PRC resident enterprise with certain relevant information within 30 days of the transfer. The tax authorities in charge
will evaluate the offshore transaction for tax purposes. In the event that the tax authorities determine that such transfer is abusing forms of
business organization and a reasonable commercial purpose for the offshore holding company other than the avoidance of PRC income tax liability
is lacking, the PRC tax authorities will be able to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer under the doctrine of substance over form. A
reasonable commercial purpose may be established when the overall international (including U.S.) offshore structure is set up to comply with the
requirements of supervising authorities of international (including U.S.) capital markets. If the SAT’s challenge of a transfer is successful, it may
deny the existence of the offshore holding company that is used for tax planning purposes and subject the seller to PRC tax on the capital gain from
such transfer. Since Circular 698 has a relatively short history, there is uncertainty as to its application. We (or a foreign investor) may become at
risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 or to establish that we (or
such foreign investor) should not be taxed under Circular 698, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations (or such foreign investor’s investment in us).
If any such PRC taxes apply, a non-PRC resident stockholder may be entitled to a reduced rate of PRC taxes under an applicable income tax treaty
and/or a foreign tax credit against such stockholder’s domestic income tax liability (subject to applicable conditions and limitations). Prospective
investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of any such taxes, the effects of any applicable income
tax treaties, and any available foreign tax credits.

Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may
materially adversely affect us.
In October 2005, the SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through
Special Purpose Companies by Residents inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75. The policy announced in this notice required PRC
residents to register with the relevant SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company, or SPV, for
the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents. Failure to
comply with the requirements of Circular 75 and any of its internal implementing guidelines as applied by SAFE in accordance with Notice 106 may
result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also result in the
SPV’s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or
liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out of China.
We requested our shareholders who are PRC residents to make the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under Circular 75
and other related rules. We attempt to comply, and attempt to ensure that our shareholders who are subject to these rules comply, with the
relevant requirements. However, we cannot provide any assurances that our shareholders who are PRC residents will comply with our request to
make any applicable registrations, and nor can we provide any assurances that our shareholders who are PRC residents will be able to obtain such
applicable registration or comply with other requirements required by Circular 75 or other related rules or that, if challenged by government
agencies, the structure of our organization fully complies with all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover, because
of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it
will affect our business operations or future strategies. Failure by such PRC resident shareholders or future PRC resident shareholders to comply
with Circular 75 or other related rules, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident shareholders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our
overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions or pay dividends, or affect our ownership
structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.
Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall
economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our competitive
position.
Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in
China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:
· the amount of government involvement;
· the level of development;
· the growth rate;
· the control of foreign exchange; and
· the allocation of resources.
37

While the Chinese economy has grown significantly in the past 20 years, we believe the growth has been uneven, both geographically and among
various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the
allocation of resources. We believe some measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example,
our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax
regulations that are applicable to us.
The Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the Chinese
government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of
productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in
China is still owned by the Chinese government. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through
the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential
treatment to particular industries or companies.
Contract drafting, interpretation and enforcement in China involve significant uncertainty.
We have entered into numerous contracts governed by PRC law, many of which are material to our business. As compared with contracts in the
United States, contracts governed by PRC law tend to contain less detail and to not be as comprehensive in defining contracting parties’ rights and
obligations. As a result, contracts in China are more vulnerable to disputes and legal challenges. In addition, contract interpretation and
enforcement in China is not as developed as in the United States, and the result of any contract dispute is subject to significant uncertainties.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to disputes under our material contracts, and if such disputes arise, we cannot assure
you that we will prevail.
The application of PRC regulations relating to the overseas listing of PRC domestic companies is uncertain, and we may be subject to
penalties for failing to request approval of the PRC authorities prior to listing our shares in the U.S.
As mentioned above, on August 8, 2006, six PRC government agencies, i.e., MOFCOM, the SAIC, the CSRC, SAFE, the State-Owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission (“SASAC”) and SAT, jointly issued the New M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8,
2006. The New M&A Rules purport, among other things, to require offshore “special purpose vehicles” that are (1) formed for the purpose of
overseas listing of the equity interests of PRC companies via acquisition and (2) are controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies and/or PRC
individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of their securities on overseas stock exchanges. On September 21,
2006, pursuant to the New M&A Rules and other PRC Laws, the CSRC published on its official website relevant guidance with respect to the listing
and trading of PRC domestic enterprises’ securities on overseas stock exchanges (the “Related Clarifications”), including a list of application
materials regarding the listing on overseas stock exchanges by special purpose vehicles. We were and are not required to obtain the approval of
CSRC under the new M&A Rules in connection with this transaction because we were and are not a special purpose vehicle formed or controlled by
PRC individuals.
However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforcement of these rules, and CSRC has yet to
promulgate any written provisions or formally to declare or state whether the overseas listing of a PRC-related company structured similar to ours
is subject to the approval of CSRC. Any violation of these rules could result in fines and other penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or
limitations on remitting dividends outside of China, and other forms of sanctions that may cause a material and adverse effect to our business,
operations and financial conditions.
38

The New M&A Rules also established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities by
foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any
change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise that owns well-known trademarks or China’s
traditional brands. We may grow our business in part by acquiring other businesses. Complying with the requirements of the New M&A Rules in
completing this type of transaction could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including CSRC approval, may delay or inhibit
our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.
We may face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to issue equity compensation to our directors and employees and
other parties who are PRC citizens or residents under PRC law. The grant of stock options under any incentive plan that we adopt in
the future would require registration with SAFE.
On April 6, 2007, SAFE issued the “Operating Procedures for Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of An Overseas Listed Company,” also known as “Circular 78”. It is not clear whether Circular 78 covers all
forms of equity compensation plans or only those that provide for the grant of stock options. For any equity compensation plan which is so covered
and is adopted by a non-PRC listed company after April 6, 2007, Circular 78 requires all participants who are PRC citizens to register with, and
obtain the approval of, SAFE prior to their participation in any such plan. In addition, Circular 78 also requires PRC citizens to register with SAFE
and make the necessary applications and filings if they participate in an overseas listed company’s covered equity compensation plan prior to April
6, 2007. As of the date of this filing, we have not adopted any incentive plans, but may do so in the future. Any such plan may grant equity
compensation, including, but not limited to, stock options, to our PRC employees and/or directors. The grant of any equity compensation under such
a plan to a PRC citizen, however, may under Circular 78 require the PRC citizen to register with and obtain approval of SAFE. We believe that the
registration and approval requirements contemplated in Circular 78 will be burdensome and time consuming. If it is determined that our such a
plan, or any equity compensation grant under such a plan, is subject to Circular 78, failure to comply with such provisions of Circular 78 may
subject us and any recipients thereof to fines and legal sanctions and prevent us from being able to grant equity compensation to our PRC
employees and/or directors. In that case, our ability to compensate our employees and directors through equity compensation would be hindered
and/or prevented.
Capital outflow policies in the PRC may hamper our ability to remit income to the United States.
The PRC has adopted currency and capital transfer regulations. These regulations may require that we comply with complex regulations for the
movement of capital and as a result we may not be able to remit all income earned and proceeds received in connection with our operations or from
the sale of our operating subsidiary to the U.S. or to our stockholders.
Our operations and assets in the PRC are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties.
Government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of the PRC may adopt policies that have the effect of hindering private
economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance that the government of China will not significantly alter its policies
from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform. In addition, a
substantial portion of productive assets in China remains government-owned. For instance, all lands are state or rural collective economic
organizations owned and leased to business entities or individuals through governmental grants of the land use rights. The grant process is
typically based on government policies at the time of the grant, which could be lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect our
business. The government of China also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling
payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Uncertainties may arise as a result of
changing governmental policies and measures. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of
confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency, the nationalization or other
expropriation of private enterprises, as well as adverse changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
39

Our use of the allocated land may be subject to challenges in the future.
All land use rights that we own are land use rights relating to allocated land. The local governmental authorities have granted such land use rights
to us for free use or at a discounted levy rate given our contribution to the development of the local economy. However, pursuant to the Catalogue
on Allocated Land issued by the Ministry of Land Resources of the PRC (the “Catalogue”), the land use rights for allocated land may only be
granted to those specific projects which are in compliance with the Catalogue, subject to the approval of the competent governmental authorities.
We, as a privately owned agricultural producer, may not be qualified to be granted such land use rights for allocated land according to the
Catalogue. Consequently, our use of such land may be subject to challenge in the future, and the legal consequences could include the confiscation
of such land by the governmental authorities or a demand that we pay a market price for purchasing the land use rights for such land and
converting the allocated land use right to a granted land use right.
Because Chinese law governs almost all of our material agreements, we may not be able to enforce our legal rights within China or
elsewhere, which could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities, or capital.
Chinese law governs almost all of our material agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce any of our material agreements or
that remedies will be available outside of China. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in China may not be as certain in
implementation and interpretation as in the United States. Our inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our current or future
agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. It will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and
enforce liabilities against our officers, directors and assets based in China.
Substantially all of our assets will be located in the PRC and all of our officers and our present directors reside outside of the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for United States investors to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to
enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal
securities laws. Moreover, we have been advised that China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments of courts with the United States. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and China would
permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties of the federal securities laws.
We do not have insurance coverage.
We currently do not purchase property insurance for our properties, including raw materials, semi-manufactured goods, manufactured goods,
buildings and machinery equipment, livestock, and we currently do not carry any product liability or other similar insurance, nor do we have
business liability or business disruption insurance coverage for our operations in the PR. There is no insurance covering risks incurred through
seasonal variation consequences. In this respect, we as an engineering based company have qualified personnel and staffs to manage and to limited
the happenings of these relevant risk factors; however there is no guarantee that accidents will not happen, and if they happen, the consequences
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Because our cash and cash equivalent are held in banks that do not provide capital guarantee insurance, the failure of any bank in
which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business.
Banks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. A significant portion of our assets are in the
form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC, and in the event of bank failure, we may not have access to, or may lose entirely, our funds on
deposit. Depending upon the amount of cash we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to such cash deposits could impair our
operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business.
40

Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or
other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may
compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time
to time in the PRC. We cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held
responsible. If our employees or agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Labor laws in the PRC may adversely affect our results of operations.
On June 29, 2007, the PRC government promulgated a new labor law, namely, the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, or the New Labor Contract Law,
which became effective on January 1, 2008. The New Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly affects the cost
of an employer’s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires that certain terminations be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event
we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the New Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to effect such changes
in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our
financial condition and results of operations.
Your ability to bring an action against us or against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, will be
limited because we conduct substantially all of our operations in the PRC and because the majority of our directors and officers
reside outside of the United States.
We are a Nevada holding company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all current operations
are conducted in the PRC. In addition, all but one of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States.
Substantial portions of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Thus, it may be difficult to effect service of process within
the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws against us and our officers and directors, none of whom are residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose
assets are located outside of the United States. It is also uncertain whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S.
courts. Our PRC legal counsel has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil
Procedures Law. Courts in the PRC may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures
Law based on treaties between the PRC and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. The PRC does not
have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States.
In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and
officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or the public interest. It is uncertain
whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.
41

Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock
Volatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.
Stock markets, in general, have experienced in recent months, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market
price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. This
increased volatility, coupled with depressed economic conditions, could continue to have a depressing effect on the market price of our common
stock. The following factors, many of which are beyond our control, may influence our stock price:
· the status of our growth strategy including the building of our new production line with any proceeds we may be able to raise in the future;
· announcements of technological or competitive developments;
· regulatory developments in the PRC affecting us, our customers or our competitors;
· announcements regarding patent or other intellectual property litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors or updates with
respect to the enforceability of patents or other intellectual property rights generally in the PRC or internationally;
· actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;
· changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;
· changes in the economic performance or market valuations of our competitors;
· additions or departures of our executive officers;
· release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding common stock; and
· sales or perceived sales of additional shares of our common stock.
In addition, the securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the
operating performance of particular companies. Any of these factors could result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of
our common stock and could cause our stockholders to incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we were involved in a class action
suit or other securities litigation, it would divert the attention of our senior management, require us to incur significant expense and, whether or
not adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
One of our directors and officers controls a majority of our common stock and his interests may not align with the interests of our
other stockholders.
Solomon Lee, our chairman, chief executive officer and president, controls our company and beneficially owns in excess of 50.1% of our issued and
outstanding common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because
investors often perceive a disadvantage in owning shares in a company with one or several controlling stockholders. Furthermore, our directors
and officers, as a Company, have the ability to significantly influence or control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all
of our assets. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that could deprive
our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our
common stock. In addition, without the consent of Mr. Lee, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us.
Mr. Lee may cause us to take actions that are opposed by other stockholders as his interests may differ from those of other stockholders.
42

Future issuances of capital stock may depress the trading price of our common stock.
Any issuance of shares of our common stock (or common stock equivalents) after the date hereof could dilute the interests of our existing
stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the
future for a number of reasons, including financing our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic
collaborations or other transactions).
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common
stock, and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future
sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.
We believe that the price of our shares in the OTC QX markets is adversely affected by the current stigma associated with Chinese companies
quoted or listed publicly in the United States.
Although we managed to maintain our liquidity to a certain degree, our share price has suffered. Many Chinese companies suffer from this stigma,
which tends to affect both market prices and liquidity, and our company is no exception. Reasons with varying degrees of legitimacy explain this
stigma, including but not limited to: (i) investors’ experience of losses suffered in the course of investing in other Chinese companies, (ii) the
difficulty some Chinese companies have had in preparing auditable financial statements, and (iii) the difficulty in enforcing US judgments in foreign
courts generally. All of these have contributed to a negative perception by some US investors regarding all Chinese companies publicly traded on
US markets. Regardless of the reasons for this perception, if it continues over a sustained period of time our market prices may continue to trade
below net tangible asset value per share. This would increase risk that our shareholders could lose the funds they invested in our company. It could
also impact our ability to maintain our growth plan on schedule, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.
The issuance of any of our equity securities pursuant any equity compensation plan we may adopt may dilute the value of existing
stockholders and may affect the market price of our stock.
In the future, we may issue to our officers, directors, employees and/or other persons equity based compensation under any equity compensation
plan we may adopt to provide motivation and compensation to our officers, employees and key independent consultants. The award of any such
incentives could result in an immediate and potentially substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could result in a decline in the value of
our stock price. The exercise of these options and the sale of the underlying shares of common stock and the sale of stock issued pursuant to stock
grants may have an adverse effect upon the price of our stock. In addition, if the holders of outstanding convertible securities convert such
securities into common stock, you will suffer further dilution.
43

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract
and retain qualified board members.
We are a public company and subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and
financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls for financial reporting. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our management report on the
effectiveness of our internal controls structure and procedures for financial reporting. Section 404 compliance may divert internal resources and
will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. If we fail to maintain compliance under Section 404, or if in the future
management determines that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to
sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market should we in the future be listed on this market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.
Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any failure
of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to
implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an
adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors. We may need to hire a number of additional employees with public accounting
and disclosure experience in order to meet our ongoing obligations as a public company, particularly if we become fully subject to Section 404 and
its auditor attestation requirements, which will increase costs. Our management team and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount
of time to new compliance initiatives and to meeting the obligations that are associated with being a public company, which may divert attention
from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our shares of common stock may be thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.
We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Our common stock is currently
traded on the OTC QX where the shares have historically been thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our
common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent.
This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock
analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we
came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase
or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we have become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of
several days, weeks or months when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large
and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot assure you
that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be
sustained or not diminish.
We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.
The stock market in general, and the shares of early stage companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These
fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies involved. If these fluctuations occur in
the future, the market price of our shares could fall regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the
market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If the market price
or volume of our shares suffers extreme fluctuations, then we may become involved in this type of litigation, which would be expensive and divert
management’s attention and resources from managing our business.
As a public company, we may also from time to time make forward-looking statements about future operating results and provide some financial
guidance to the public markets. Our management has limited experience as a management team in a public company and as a result projections
may not be made timely or set at expected performance levels and could materially affect the price of our shares. Any failure to meet published
forward-looking statements that adversely affect the stock price could result in losses to investors, stockholder lawsuits or other litigation,
sanctions or restrictions issued by the SEC.
44

Securities analysts may elect not to report on our common stock or may issue negative reports that adversely affect the stock price.
At this time, to our knowledge no securities analysts provide research coverage of our common stock, and securities analysts may not elect not to
provide such coverage in the future. It may remain difficult for our company, with its small market capitalization, to attract independent financial
analysts that will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect
the stock’s actual and potential market price. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that
industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more analysts elect to cover our company and then downgrade the stock, the
stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market,
which, in turn, could cause our stock price to decline. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

We do not own any of the land mentioned in the table above
Land ownership in China
In China, nearly all land is owned by the Central Government or local village collectives, which grant “usufructuary” rights (i.e., the right to use and
enjoy the derived benefits for a period of time) in the form of land use rights. This is similar to “leasehold” land rights in the United States.
Corporate entities and individuals may own the property (buildings) erected on Government land. Land use rights may be transferred, but they are
based on agricultural contracts, and cannot be changed arbitrarily to non-agricultural purposes.
In general, the Government owns all land. In urban areas, the land is owned directly by the central Government. In rural and suburban areas, the
local village collectives, usually through the villagers’ collective economic organization, or the village committees, own the agricultural land.
Uncultivated land in mountain and other remote areas is also Government-owned. Corporate entities and individuals may own the enhancements
(buildings, fences, and other structures) erected on Government land.
As such, any transferrable rights to the land are in the form of usufructuary rights (i.e., the right to use and enjoy the benefits derived therefrom for
a period of time).
There are several types of usufructuary rights. These include the right to land contractual management (granted by local village collectives for
agriculture land), the right to use of construction land (state land in urban areas), etc. The right to land contractual management allows a party the
rights to possess, utilize, and obtain profits from agricultural land. This right is transferrable, but this land use right is based on agricultural
household contracts and cannot be changed arbitrarily to non-agricultural purposes.
A usufructuary right properly granted in accordance with the laws may be transferred, leased, or mortgaged in accordance with the laws and the
terms of the land-grant contract.
1. A lease confers on the recipient the same right to use and enjoy the benefits, except for the right to own the building erected by the recipient and
the right to transfer. In case of government acquisition of the land, the compensation paid by the government for the building will go to the lessor,
unless the lease agreement states otherwise. The Agreement for the 109.79MU land of HSA is stated to be a lease agreement but the terms therein
seem to suggest that HSA is being granted a Management Right.
46

2 & 3. Land Use Rights and Management Rights confer the same right to use and enjoy the benefits. “Land Use Right” is one granted by the State
and usually used in the context of urban land, whereas local village collectives grant “Management Rights” and the term usually applies to rural
land.
4. The term Land Use Right relates to the right to use the land and enjoy the benefits derived there from, whereas Building Ownership Right relates
to the right to ownership of the building erected on the land concerned. SJAP was granted a Land Use Right by the State for the land (state-owned
land), and a Building Ownership Right for the buildings erected thereon.
As producers active in the agriculture industry, our subsidiaries are presently exempt from income tax and enjoy various incentive grants and
subsidies given by the China Government. If the Chinese government were to change its presently favorable policy toward the agriculture industry,
we would no longer enjoy our present tax-related privileges, which would materially and adversely impact our sales performance, margins, and net
profit and our costs structure. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, quick changes of policies by the Chinese government. If we
do not effectively and efficiently manage our growth on time due to lack of capital, we could suffer adversely from the consequences of any such
policy changes.

A summary of each business division and operations is described below:
Businesses Division:
¨ Fishery Division refers to the operations of Capital Award Inc. (“Capital Award” or “CA”) covering its engineering, technology and consulting
service management of fishery farms, technology transfers and seafood sales and marketing, where;
Capital Award generates revenues from providing engineering consulting services as turnkey contractors to owners and developers of fishery
projects that are being designed and engineered into turnkey contracts by Capital Award in China using its A Power Module Technology
Systems (“APM”) as follows:
(A). Engineering and Technology Services; via Consulting and Service Contracts (“CSC’s”) for the development, construction, and supply of
plant and equipment, and management of fishery (and prawn or shrimp) farms and related business operations. From January 2020 up to the
date of this annual report CA has not been able to do any fishery project or fishery project development due to the effects of the Pandemic
COVID-19 as such, there was no revenue generated from January 2020 to May 31st 2021. However, the Company and CA have been exploring
other possible business opportunities during the period and SIAF became the joint venture partner of the China Africa Joint Chamber of
Commerce and Industries (CAJCCI) which is a non-profit organization established in November 2016 by the China and Africa Governments to
plan and to implement agriculture projects and related developments in Africa through development fund of US$60 Billion every three years
provided by and granted by the China Government to Africa Nations in Agriculture industry projects and developments etc. In March 2021,
development project papers in (i). Development of Trading of exporting dried cassavas to China and exporting of plant and equipment from
China to Madagascar and developments of cassavas plantations and related value added processing and drying of cassavas on 100,000 acres of
land in Madagascar and (ii). Development of goat farms and related value added processing in Madagascar were submitted to CAJCCI and
Government of Madagascar; by early May 2021, both CAJCCI and the Government of Madagascar gave consents to both projects such that we
have obtained official invitation to go to Madagascar to initiate the Projects subjecting to the Pandemic COVID-19 situation and conditions will
be improved and controlled, we shall have our team members (including various professionals and professionals from CAJCCI) to assist our
current Madagascar management teams of two members in Madagascar to start up the Projects.
(B). Seafood Sales from CA’s projected farms; became a discontinued segment of operations from October 5, 2016 when Tri-way was
disposed to other third parties in term Tri-way was reclassified as an unconsolidated equity investee on same date.
51

l Corporate & Others Division refers to the trading segment of business operations of the Group named internally under corporate division of
Sino Agro Food, Inc., including import/export business and consulting and service operations provided to projects that are not included in the
above categories, and not limited to corporate affairs. Over the years up until end of fiscal year 2019 the corporate division imported mainly live
seafood from South Africa countries, Vietnam, Thailand, Russian and other nearby countries and frozen beef from Australia and South America
countries; however it is due to the interruptions and adverse impacts caused by the Pandemic COVID-19 made it impossible and unprofitable to
continue the imports of live seafood, and the poor political relationship between China and Australia in 2020 induced high risks on the imports
of Australian beef. The Corporate’s trading division based on standalone figures ended up with a loss of over $1.6 million as at 31.12 2020.
However, over the years the Company has built up a strong base of connections and customers in China that provides an unique opportunity to
the Company to develop an additional Trading Platform aiming to generate additional revenues, profits and most importantly positive cash
flows, so from July 2020 onward, the corporate division started to explore the opportunities of importing some of the China markets’ niche
products and managed to start to import from March 2021, frozen chicken (that China imports millions of metric tons annually) and pork
products (that China has been in shortage since the pandemic of European Swine Diseases occurred in 2018 disrupted the domestic supply of
pork estimated until year 2026), from Brazil, USA, Argentina and other South America countries and (ii). Dried agriculture products (i.e. Dried
Cassavas that has vast industrial and consumable food processing applications, that China has an annual short fall of over 4 million MT;
peanuts, cashew-nuts, Soybeans that China imports multiples of millions of MT annually, etc.) from South Africa Countries (i.e. Madagascar,
Ghana, Nigeria and Cote D’lovire etc.) and Brazil. Although in so far the Company achieved minimal financial impacts, (please refer to a
standalone Q1 2021 income statement of the Trading division attached in the later Chapter named Subsequent events). During months of
venturing into this trading activity, we experienced many teething problems and obstacles especially with the supplies of the said commodities
affected mainly by the said Pandemic situations causing much stringent and constant changes of importation regulations requiring much
tougher importation and cargoes release conditions and procedures, précised timely and orderly documentary presentation with the China
custom authority and extremely tight controls domestically disorientated all arrangements with domestic cold storages and logistic operations
etc. resulting in inconstancy of the supplies and untimely deliveries etc. Disregarding all of these difficult consequences and hardship, the
Company feels that persistence, tolerance and with time, the trading division will prevailed leading the Company into a positive cash rich path
targeting encourage performances to show starting from the early quarter 1 of fiscal year 2022. ’
Leasing and subcontracting of operations:
Over the years, there has been significant capital expenditures (CPE) and working capital (WC) required for and employed on the developments,
expansion and operations of the minor operational activities that we managed to fund while our two core businesses (in the Cattle and beef of SJAP
and the Fishery of CA) were generating sufficient cash flows and incomes, however after the collapse of the SJAP’s business from 2016 and the
poor performances of the Mega farms from 2017 (“Crises”) for reasons mentioned in the earlier chapters and the previous Ks and Qs reports, the
Company is no longer in the position to support and to finance the growth of these minor operational businesses in the way as they were before the
Crises, therefore in order that capital spending could be kept within an affordable level, the Company decided to lease and sub-contract the
following operations to their respective operational managements from 1st October 2019 as such there are no sales revenue and income derived
from these operations but leasing and sub-contracting revenues and incomes thereon.
52

l The operation of Hunan Shenghua A Power Agriculture Co. Ltd. (“HSA”) is in manufacturing and sales of organic fertilizer. From 1st
October 2019 the Company contracted out its manufacturing and sales of organic fertilizer to its operational management; as such income of
HSA is derived mainly from said management contract. Historically, HSA was developed to enhance more sales and profits of SJAP’s fertilizer
due to the availability of a direct cargo train service between Xining and Hunan having a station within close proximity to HSA’s operation site
and Hunan is a strong agricultural province producing big quantity of rice, tobaccos, tea and multiple varieties of produces that requires large
quantity of fertilizer (especially in organic fertilizer due to the Government’s direction to phase out the application of chemical fertilizer in
China). During the period of developing HSA’s business it was discovered that Hunan is big in aquaculture having many and large areas in
natural fresh water lakes where aquaculture of fresh water fish is a dominated industry, as such HSA developed a water soluble fertilizer
specially applied for and by the lake fishery farms to provide nutrients to the water plants and micro-organism for the sea animals etc. Although
it was an excellent product but aging receivables were always a big problems to HSA with the fishery operators, the constant up-keeps and
replacements of new production plants & equipment and the forever requirement of expending working areas and buildings to keep up with the
productivity and the long (i.e. over 60 days) period of fermentation of raw materials required huge capital funds (both in CPE and WC) that the
Company was not able to supply consistently and that was why HSA hasn’t reached its ultimate potential of becoming a multiple millions of MT
per year producer. However HSA has a block of leased hilly land of 450 Chinese Mu, in which HSA developed 50 Mu originally for a cattle
station that was changed into a piggery (with the capacity to hold 4,000 pigs at a time and producing 10,000 heads of pigs per year) in 2017
after the collapse of the local cattle industry. It was necessary to cut half of the hill in the said 50 Mu to get enough land leveled to build the
said piggery, then it was discovered that the 450 Mu land consisting many fine sand hills. From 2018 onward the China Government stopped
most of the sand mining operations in the country so all of a sudden fine construction sand became a valuable commodity with 2019’s averaged
prices (of RMB245 / cubic meter or m3) jumped more than 12 times of 2017’s averaged prices. As such HSA is sitting on a block of valuable
property. But sand mining is restricted by the China Government Regulation so it is impossible to obtain any sand mining permits. By
September of 2020 the Company strategically designed a business plan for HSA to expand its piggery to produce 200,000 head of pigs per
annual using and developing the whole of said 450 Mu that will be financed ultimately by the fine sand recovered from said development’s
leveling activities. In this aspect, the related Project’s business plan (including all feasibility, viability and environmental studies) have been
prepared with approaches and dialogues have been made with a number of China owned entities aiming to attract enough investors to finance
the Project as soon as possible. Although currently the Pandemic effects hinder many businesses’ decisions making it difficult to predict any
tangible schedule for this Hunan Project, however, our management team members are working diligently on it hoping that soon a clearer road
will be opened to allow them to pick up momentum on the Project.
53

l Plantation Division refers to the operations of Jiangmen City Heng Sheng Tai Agriculture Development Co. Ltd. (“JHST”) in the HU Plantation
business where dragon fruit flowers (dried and fresh), crops of vegetables and immortal vegetables (dried) are sold to wholesale and retail
markets. JHST’s financial statements are consolidated into the financial statements of Macau EIJI Company Ltd. (“MEIJI”) as one entity. From
1st October 2019 the Company contracted out its plantation operation to its operational management; as such income of JHST is derived mainly
from said management contract. Over the years, the Company has tried many means to increase the performances of the plantation (of 1,250
Chinese Mu) but failed due mainly to the plantation is situated in an area subjecting to heavy rainfalls yearly that induced root diseases to the
dragon fruit plants stopping the yield of flowers. 1,250 Mu plantation is too small for growing of other selective fruit plants except for the
growing of cash crops (i.e. seasonal vegetables etc.), however growing of cash crops is labor intensive, so with the forever increases of labor
and operation costs in China and the seasonal unpredictable sales prices of cash crops, managements of the Company has yet to find a suitable
solution for JHST but keep on trying hoping that eventually a perfect solution will surface to revitalize JHST. In the meantime leasing and
contracting JHST ‘s operation to its existing operational management will limit the Company’s financing exposure in both CPE and WC
requirements from JHST.
l Cattle Farm Division refers to the operations of Cattle Farm 1 under Jiangmen City Hang Mei Cattle Farm Development Co. Ltd (“JHMC”)
where cattle are sold live to third party livestock wholesalers who sell them mainly to Guangzhou and Beijing livestock wholesale markets. The
financial statements of JHMC are consolidated into MEIJI as one entity along with MEIJI’s operation in the consulting and service for
development of other cattle farms (e.g., Cattle Farm 2) or related projects. From 1st October 2019 the Company contracted out its cattle
operation to its operational management; as such incomes of JHMC are derived mainly from said management contract. JHMC’s business
strategy in 2018 of changing into fattening of the Asian Yellow Cattle instead of the fattening of conventional breed of cattle (i.e. Angus and
Simantals etc.) proven to be a good strategic change increasing revenues and incomes each year ever since. However this cattle operation is too
small (with. Cattle Farm 1 and 2 operate on 500 Chinese Mu) coupling with the increasing of land and development costs making it extremely
difficult for the Company to finance its expansion plan at the moment as such by leasing and contracting JHMC’s cattle operation to its existing
operational management will provide the Company with a small but steady incomes each year and will limit capital funding to JHMC until such
time the Company is in a better financial position to consider JHMC’s expansion plan.

Investments in investees:
SJAP: Up until 1st October 2019, cattle and beef divisional operation of our partially owned subsidiary Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture
Co., Ltd. (“SJAP”) in manufacturing and sales of organic fertilizer, bulk livestock feed, concentrated livestock feed, and the sales of live cattle
inclusive of: (a) cattle that are not being slaughtered in our own slaughter house operated by Qinghai Zhong He Meat Products Co., Limited
(“QZH”) are sold live to third party livestock wholesalers, and (b) cattle that are sold to QZH and slaughtered and deboned and packed by QZH; and
the sales of meats deboned and packed by QZH that are sold to various meat distributors, wholesalers and super market chains and our own retail
butcher stores. QZH is a fully owned subsidiary of SJAP; as such, the financial statements of these three companies (SJAP, QZH and HSA) are
consolidated into our wholly owned subsidiary, A Power Agro Agriculture Development (Macau) Limited (“APWAM”), as one entity. SJAP and QZH
are both variable interest entities over which we exercise significant control. As of December 30, 2017, QZH was derecognized as variable interest
entity and its operating profit and/or loss no longer accretive to the Company’s 41.25% holding in SJAP, a variable interest entity. More details
related to QZH’s discontinuance of operations is delineated throughout other sections of this report. In November 2015 the China Government
announced a Macro Economic Policy to allow the imports of cattle and beef from many developing and developed countries that impacted adversely
and directly to its local cattle and beef industry, all of a sudden the local cattle and beef industry was transformed from a protected industry to a
non-protected industry, as such SJAP was on a decline financially since 2016 that took SJAP 3 full years to stop the bleeding capped the losses
totaling to S$ 12 million as shown in SIAF’s 10K 31.12 2019 report. On September 30th 2019, Mr. Solomon Lee resigned as the Chairman of SJAP
resulting in categorization of SJAP as an Investor in Associate from a subsidiary status, and SJAP contracted out its business operations to its
existing operational management, as such it is not a variable interest entity and SJAP was reclassified as an unconsolidated equity investee and
SJAP’s cattle and beef operation is discontinued on same date.
However in 2020 it is due to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, SJAP again suffered badly with further losses of $1.28 million that was
saved by a Government Grant of $1.48 million netting profit of $200,000 for 2020. It is because SJAP became an investee of SIAF since 01102019
such that its 2020 financial is not detailed in SIAF’s 10K 2020 financial report but under Chapter of Subsequent events of SIAF’s 10K 2020 a
separated information memorandum attached showing SJAP’s 2020 Income Statements. Before the Pandemic COVID-19 events in 2019, a
revitalization plan was developed between the company SIAF, SJAP and the Xining Government aiming to rebuild, turn and reorganize SJAP into
one of the biggest cattle and beef operating complexes of the Country. The business and development plan of the Project is summarized as follows:
(i). The local Government of Huangyuan district Xining (where SJAP’s core operations are located), agreed in principle to grant an additional 450
Chinese Mu zoned commercial land to SJAP such that together with SJAP’s existing land bank of 415 Chinese Mu zoned commercial and industrial
land amounting to a total of 865 Chinese Mu of land collectively for the said project’s developments, (ii). The Project is to develop multiple
wholesaling and retailing centers and outlets, cold storages and warehouses facilities, logistics and distribution and servicing establishments,
abattoirs and value added processing factories and facilities, e-commerce centers and other supporting community services etc. to cater for 4
million heads of locally breed (long hair wild cattle) grown annually in the Huangyuan county and Xining Districts, (iii). The Project is to be
developed in multiple phases for completion in 5 years with cash flows and revenues to be generated from Phase (2) of the development starting
from the beginning of year 3, and its equity structure is planned to be shared between the China Central and local Government owned entities,
SJAP and a number of Public Companies listed on the China Stock Exchange, (iv). Financing of the Project is planned to be shared between the
possible future development grants and incentives provided by the Central and local Governments, the shareholders of the Project Company and
SJAP’s assets and operations etc. and the final exit plan is to list SJAP in the Main Board of China Stock Exchange sometimes within the
development period of 5 years. It is a huge project creating many businesses opportunities for the up-stream and down-stream industries and
associated activities, tens of thousands of employment opportunities and social impacts etc., involving multiple of tens of billion dollars in capital
expenditure and generating multiple of hundreds of billion dollars per year in various sales and servicing revenues and incomes etc. as such the
drafting of its comprehensive business and related development plan is still in progress and on-going after it has been interrupted, changed,
amended and reproduced a number of times due to the change of situations and conditions impacted and up-sets caused by the Pandemic COVID-
19 and in reality there have been a number of progresses making positive steps (i.e. most of the relevant government departments, investor,
potential up-stream and down-stream participators, heads of many labor unions and society committees, potential construction contractors and
core materials suppliers etc. of the Project were introduced to the Project and consenting with the Project’s overall aim and directions and their
involvements in the Project, the allocation of Project land is progressing having constant dialogues between SJAP and the Government’s land
department, progresses have been made with a number of banking channels, property sales and marketing advisors, progress on the study of
environmental impacts and various related viability and feasibility studies etc. All concerned parties are hoping for the right economics conditions

TWL: Up until 5th October 2016, our divisional fishery production and sales operation was with our fully owned subsidiary Tri-way Industries
Limited (TWL or Tri-way, a private company incorporated in Hong Kong ) and our 75% owned subsidiary Jiangman Fishery Development Co. Ltd.
(JFD, a limited liability company incorporated in China) operating one indoor APM farm in Enping District, Enping City. On 5th October 2016 we
carve out Tri-way that became an unconsolidated investee of the Company resulted with the Company owning 36.6% equity interest in Tri-way
derived from (i) 23.89% as a result of retained interest in Tri-way, and (ii) 12.71% acquired in exchange for outstanding debt owed to the Company
at the time. An independent appraisal was obtained to determine fair value, and this appraisal resulted in a one-time (deemed) gain of USD 56.9
million for SIAF. In reference to the press release dated January 17, 2017, wherein the Company had indicated that legal due diligence had been
completed in relation to the carve-out of its aquaculture operations, the announcement that legal due diligence had been performed had been
released in conjunction with what had been the main announcement, which was SIAF wishing to convey to its shareholders that JFD had been
officially registered as a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise of Tri-way, making it legally eligible for SIAF shareholders to now own shares of Tri-
way, directly. Many information related to Tri-way (The unconsolidated investee of the Company) were reported and / or recapped in respective
10K and 10Q since 2016 onward to this 2020 10K report.
Somehow, the extremely poor operational performances of its Mega Farm (AFF 4 & 5) and its incomes in 2017 to 2019 were generated mainly from
the operations of AFF 1, 2 , 3a & 3b and other sub-contracted farms. Coupling the said poor performances of the Mega farm, impacts of the COVID-
19 Pandemic of 2020 caused a complete write-off for AFF 1, 2,and 3 as well as to Tri-way’s sub-contracted farms incurring losses over $77 million
for the fiscal year of 2020 causing all farms to stop work for over 7 months without sufficient workers, feed, supplementary, medications,
transportation and maintenances etc. to keep the live stocks going and they all died during the period calculating to multiple million pieces
(equivalent to multiple of thousand metric tons). It is estimated that it will cost over $80 million in Capital Expenditures and Working Capital and
two years to replace said live stocks and to bring the fishery operation of the said Aqua-farms back to the revenue and income generated in fiscal
year 2019. Currently Tri-way is in a very poor financial situation as such it is not practically possible for Tri-way to revitalize and to rebuild its
operations in a hurry but to reduce its operations and to concentrate its efforts on rebuilding of brood stocks, the production of fingerling and
nursery stocks and repairing the damages etc. It is anticipating that under current conditions, Tri-way will take a long period to recovery. However
what had happened to Tri-way doesn’t mean the end of the road for Tri-way, because (i) China is the world biggest aquaculture producer and aqua-
products consumers, therefore our APRAS technology and its in-door APM farms and ODRAS dams are the niche of the aquaculture industry of
China and many other developing countries of the world, our aqua-farms have proven track records of performances and sustainable viability and
the quality live seafood produced by our aqua-farms have already established market niches in the China markets etc. and (ii) Tri-way has been
working closely with the Company on business plans since July 2020 based on improving revenues, profits and in turn cash flows strategically to
lead Tri-way into its recovery path as soon as possible. Although it is difficult to materialize any prediction or plan under the current environment
affected by the Pandemic COVID-19, however managements of Tri-way are trying relentlessly and continuously to overcome all obstacles
encountered so far and beyond aiming to recover within the shortest time possible.

Note (16A): Analysis of other payables (current liabilities):
As of December 31, 2019, we have other payables totaling $42,514,342, comprised of the following:
(1). Straight note payable of $29,367,999 represents a 10.5% Convertible Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $33,300,000 issued on
August 29, 2014. On July 18, 2018, the Company and the note holder entered into a restructuring agreement regarding the settlement of the Note
as follows:
(i) 50% in cash settlement of $15,589,000 to be paid in monthly installments.
(ii) The other 50% balance of $15,589,000 to be settled by the issuance of 5,196,333 common shares of the Company and 400,000 shares of Tri-
way Industries Limited.
As of the date of this report, the Company has paid $4 million with $11,589,000 remaining owed on the $15,589,000 balance.
February 3, 2019 the said repayment of $4 million was readjusted to $3.69 million.
We filed an 8-K on December 12, 2019 to state that we received a notice of default (the “Notice”) from ECAB on December 12, 2018 contending
that a new Note was in default because (i) SIAF had not made repayments on the new Note in the manner prescribed by its terms, and (ii) of
certain other unspecified events of default. While ECAB stated in the Notice that it has not elected to accelerate the right to repayment of the
entire principal amount, including accrued but unpaid interest on the ECAB Note, it reserves the right to do so.
67

Prior to receipt of the Notice from ECAB, the Company was attempting to reach a negotiated settlement with ECAB. Notwithstanding receipt of the
Notice, the Company hopes to continue to work with ECAB to settle its obligations under the ECAB Note. The Company intends to vigorously
defend its position should a mutually amicable resolution prove unattainable.
Subsequently, Note 1 would be matured on February 28, 2020 the Company intends to offer the settlement of the note to the accredited investors
based on the following understanding, terms and conditions:
(i). The earlier understanding of the restructured indebtedness is to be carried as follows: (a) SIAF issues 5,196,333 shares of its common stock and
transfer 400,000 shares of TRW to the note holder; and (b) SIAF is to pay the revised promissory note in the principal amount of $15,589,000 to the
note holder.
(ii). It is the Company’s intension for the said 5,196,333 shares of its common stocks to be converted into the G Series Preferred Stocks at
conversion ratio of the offer of the Initial Public Offer stated in the registration statement filed with SEC targeting on or before June 30, 2021.
(iii). There were 500,050 Common Shares of the Company loaned to the said accredited investor on (Date: July 22, 2014) valued at US$18.10 /
share as security for the accredited investors to secure their investors to invest on the Bond prior to the completion of a registration statement filed
with SEC on June 2014 to allow the official issuing of additional common stocks to ECAB’s BOND investors, and that ECAB would return back the
loaned stocks back to the Company upon the time the said accredited investor invested the balance of the Note 1 proceed of (US$ 13,362,550)
needed to complete the disbursement of the total loan proceed of US$25,000,000 on or before (Date: February 28th 2015). However the said
investor sold the said loaned 500,050 common stocks of the Company in between the period (Date: February to March 2015) and invested part or
the full sum from the sales proceeds of said 500,050 common stock of the Company (of US$10,500,000) back to the Company as part of the Note
1’s disbursement to the Company making total disbursement sum of US$22,137,450.00 being advanced to the Company on or before 30th
June 2015, and in turn, the investor did not return the said 500,050 common stocks of the Company to the Company and didn’t help the Company to
complete the said registration statement by not giving the Company the Debenture Agreement requested by SEC and needed to complete said
registration statement with SEC.
(iv). In order that the principal amount of $15,589,000 of the cash settlement sum mentioned above may be settled amicably between the
accredited investor and the Company, the sales proceeds (of US$13,362,550.00) from the sales of the 500,050 shares loaned in good faith to ECAB
must be taken into consideration and be deduced from the said principal amount before this bond arrangements can be settled.
68

(2). As of the date of this report we have other payables due to various third parties totaling $8,932,314.60, comprising the following:
(i). A loan was granted by a friendly third party on October 12, 2017 for $6 million that was recorded at later date by a loan agreement executed on
February 18, 2019 for $6,301,480 (inclusive of an additional loan of $301,480 granted by the same third party on February 2, 2019. This loan is to
be re-paid in 3 tranches inclusive of accrued interest calculated to time of repayments comprising Tranche (1) for $2,300,000, Tranche (2) for
$2,350,000 and Tranche (3) for $2,746,702 on August 31, 2019, October 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, respectively, for total repayment

$812,028.60 for year 2019 and 2020 respectively making total loan repayments inclusive accrued interest calculated to $8,932,314.60 as at
December 31st 2020.
(ii). A number of friendly third parties granted various advances and extended debts to the Company during the past years, and as at the date of
this report the total loan and debts recorded under other payables of the Company’s account amounting to $9,345,811 collectively that in general
do not have fixed terms of repayments and interest. However it was due to the hardship caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic 2020 to the Company,
the said friendly third parties agreed to write off the debt of $9,345,811 by accepting other friendly Triway members’ offers to compensate them
with Tri-way shares from their own holdings (Settlement arrangement). Therefore as at December 31st 2020 the Company has no more debt due to
the said friendly third parties and a promise note from one of the friendly third party for an amount of $1,757,858.30 due to the Company for
receiving extra Tri-way shares under the Settlement arrangement.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of SIAF, its subsidiaries Capital Award, CS, CH, TRW, MEIJI, JHST, JFD,
JHMC, HSA, APWAM, SAFS and its variable interest entities SJAP and QZH. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated Financial Statements
from the effective date of acquisition.
71

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Company adopted the accounting pronouncements relating to business combinations (primarily contained in ASC Topic 805 “Business
Combinations”), including assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies. These pronouncements established principles and
requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquire as well as provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the
business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination. In addition, these pronouncements eliminate the distinction between contractual and non-contractual
contingencies, including the initial recognition and measurement criteria and require an acquirer to develop a systematic and rational basis for
subsequently measuring and accounting for acquired contingencies depending on their nature. Our adoption of these pronouncements will have an
impact on the manner in which we account for any future acquisitions.
NON - CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company adopted the accounting pronouncement on non-controlling interests in consolidated financial statements, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance is
primarily contained in ASC Topic “Consolidation”. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this standard has not had material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods
covered thereby. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s
accounting policies in certain areas. The following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: determinations of the
useful lives of assets, estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of
long-lived assets, estimates of the reliability of deferred tax assets and inventory reserves.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 605. Sales revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) the ability to collect is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally satisfied at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title passes to
the customer. Service revenue is recognized when services have been rendered to a buyer by reference to the stage of completion. License fee
income is recognized on the accrual basis in accordance with the underlying agreements.
72

Government grants are recognized upon (i) the Company has substantially accomplished what we must be done pursuant to the terms of the
policies and terms of the grant that are established by the local government; and (ii) the Company receives notification from the local government
that the Company has satisfied all of the requirements to receive the government grants; and or (iii) the amounts are received.
Multiple-Element Arrangements
To qualify as a separate unit of accounting under ASC 605-25“Multiple Element Arrangements”, the delivered item must have value to the customer
on a standalone basis. The significant deliverables under the Company’s multiple-element arrangements are consulting and service under
development contract, commission and management service.
Revenues from the Company's fishery development services contract are performed under fixed-price contracts. Revenues under long-term
contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”). Under the percentage-of-completion
method, the Company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognized that
profit over the contract term. The percentage of costs incurred determines the amount of revenue to be recognized. Payment terms are generally
defined by the installation contract and as a result may not match the timing of the costs incurred by the Company and the related recognition of
revenue. Such differences are recorded as either costs or estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of
costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.
The Company determines a customer’s credit worthiness at the time an order is accepted. Sudden and unexpected changes in a customer’s
financial condition could put recoverability at risk.
The percentage of completion method requires the ability to estimate several factors, including the ability of the customer to meet its obligations
under the contract, including the payment of amounts when due. If the Company determines that collectability is not assured, we will defer revenue
recognition and use methods of accounting for the contract such as the completed contract method until such time as the Company determines that
collectability is reasonably assured or through the completion of the project.
73

For fixed-price contracts, the Company uses the ratio of costs incurred to date on the contract (excluding uninstalled direct materials) to
management's estimate of the contract's total costs, to determine the percentage of completion on each contract. This method is used as
management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progression of these contracts. Contract costs included all direct
material, subcontract and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as supplies, tool repairs and depreciation. The
Company accounts for maintenance and repair services under the guidance of ASC 605 as the services provided relate to construction work.
Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in job
performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability arising from contract penalty, change orders and final contract settlements may result in
revisions to the estimated profitability during the contract. These changes, which include contracts with estimated costs in excess of estimated
revenues, are recognized as contract costs in the period in which the revisions are determined. Profit incentives are included in revenues when
their realization is reasonably assured. At the point the Company anticipates a loss on a contract, the Company estimates the ultimate loss through
completion and recognizes that loss in the period in which the possible loss was identified.
The Company does not provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the customers can claim warranty directly
from product manufacturers for defects in equipment or products. Historically, the Company has experienced no warranty claims.
The Company’s fishery development consultancy services revenues are recognized when the relevant services are rendered, and are subject to a
Chinese business tax at a rate of 0% of the gross fishery development contract service income approved by the Chinese local government.
4. COST OF GOODS SOLD AND SERVICES
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct purchase cost of merchandise goods, and related levies. Cost of services consists primarily of direct
cost and indirect cost incurred to date for development contracts and provision for anticipated losses on development contracts.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING
Shipping and handling costs related to cost of goods sold are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0 and $156,103 for
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
ADVERTISING
Advertising costs are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0, and $956,056 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research and development expenses are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0 and $855,167 for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
74

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. Cash and
cash equivalents kept with financial institutions in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are not insured or otherwise protected. Should any of
those institutions holding the Company’s cash become insolvent, or the Company is unable to withdraw funds for any reason, the Company could
lose the cash on deposit on that institution.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable
and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Terms of the sales vary. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification
basis.
The standard credit period of the Company’s most of customers is three months. Any amount that has an extended settlement date of over one year
is classified as a long term receivable. Management evaluates the collectability of the receivables at least quarterly.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) and net realizable value. Costs incurred in bringing each
product to its location and conditions are accounted for as follows:
• raw materials - purchase cost on a weighted average basis;
• manufactured finished goods and work-in-progress - cost of direct materials and labor and a proportion of manufacturing overhead based on
normal operation capacity but excluding borrowing costs; and
• retail and wholesale merchandise finished goods - purchase cost on a weighted average basis.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Such costs include the cost of
replacing parts that are eligible for capitalization when the cost of replacing the parts is incurred. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and
depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each year.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
75

Milk cows 10 years
Plant and machinery 5 - 10 years
Structure and leasehold improvements 10 - 30 years
Mature seed and herbage cultivation 20 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 2.5 - 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 - 10 years
An item of property and equipment is removed from the accounts upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on disposal of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the item) is included in the consolidated statements of income in the period the item is disposed.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is an asset representing the fair economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually
identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the end of the company’s fiscal year, or when
impairment indicators arise. The Company uses a fair-value-based approach to test for impairment at the level of each reporting unit. The Company
directly acquired MEIJI, which is engaged in Hu Plantation. As a result of this acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of
$724,940. This goodwill represents the fair value of the assets acquired in these acquisitions over the cost of the assets acquired.
PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES
The Company has determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of products is completed. Master license of
stock feed manufacturing technology was acquired and the costs of acquisition were capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological
feasibility had been established. Proprietary technologies are intangible assets of finite lives. Proprietary technologies are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated lives of 25 years.
An aromatic cattle-feeding formula was acquired and the costs of acquisition are capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological
feasibility has been established. Cost of acquisition on aromatic cattle-feeding formula is amortized using the straight-line method over its
estimated life of 20 years.
The cost of sleepy cod breeding technology license is capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological feasibility has been established.
Cost of granting sleepy cod breeding technology license is amortized using the straight-line method over its entitled life of 25 years.
Bacterial cellulose technology license and related trademark are capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological feasibility has been
established. Cost of license and related trademark is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated life of 20 years.
76

Management evaluates the recoverability of proprietary technologies on an annual basis of the end of the company’s fiscal year, or when
impairment indicators arise. As required by ASC Topic 350 “Intangible - Goodwill and Other”, the Company uses a fair-value-based approach to test
for impairment.
CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
Construction in progress represents direct costs of construction as well as acquisition and design fees incurred. Capitalization of these costs ceases
and the construction in progress is transferred to property and equipment when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the assets for
their intended use are completed. No depreciation is provided until construction is completed and the asset is ready for its intended use.
LAND USE RIGHTS
Land use rights represent acquisition of land use right rights of agriculture land from farmers and are amortized on the straight line basis over the
respective lease periods. The lease period of agriculture land is in the range from 10 years to 60 years. Land use rights purchase prices were
determined in accordance with the PRC Government’s minimum lease payments of agriculture land and mutually agreed between the company and
the vendors. No independent professional appraiser performed a valuation of land use rights at the balance sheet dates.
CORPORATE JOINT VENTURE
A corporation formed, owned, and operated by two or more businesses (ventures) as a separate and discrete business or project (venture) for their
mutual benefit is considered to be a corporate joint venture. Investee entities, in which the company can exercise significant influence, but not
control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the company’s share of the earnings or
losses of these companies is included in net income.
A loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized as a charge to operations. Evidence of a loss in value might
include, but would not necessarily be limited to absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to
sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY
An entity (investee) in which the investor has obtained less than a majority-owned interest, according to the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB). A variable interest entity (VIE) is subject to consolidation if a VIE is an entity meeting one of the following three criteria as elaborated in
ASC Topic 810-10, Consolidation.
77

(a) the equity-at-risk is not sufficient to support the entity's activities;
(b) as a group, the equity-at-risk holders cannot control the entity; or
(c) the economics do not coincide with the voting interests.
If a firm is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the holdings must be disclosed on the balance sheet. The primary beneficiary is defined as the person
or company with the majority of variable interests.
TREASURY STOCK
Treasury stock consists of a Company’s own stock which has been issued, but is subsequently reacquired by the Company. Treasury stock does not
reduce the number of shares issued but does reduce the number of shares outstanding. These shares are not eligible to receive cash dividends.
Accounting for excesses and deficiencies on treasury stock transactions is governed by ASC 505-30-30.
State laws and federal agencies closely regulate transactions involving a company’s own capital stock, so the purchase of outstanding shares and
converting them into treasury shares must have a legitimate purpose. Some of the most common reasons for purchasing outstanding shares are as
follows:
(i) to meet additional stock needs for various reasons, including newly implemented stock option plans, the issuance stock for convertible bonds or
convertible preferred stock, or a stock dividend;
(ii) to eliminate the ownerships interests of a stockholder;
(iii) to increase the market price of the stock that returns capital to shareholders; and
(iv) to potentially increase earnings per share of the stock by decreasing the shares outstanding on the same earnings.
The Company has adopted the cost method of accounting for treasury stock shares. The purchase of outstanding shares is treated as a temporary
reduction in shareholders’ equity in view of the expectation to reissue the shares instead of retiring them. When the Company reissues the treasury
shares, the temporary account is eliminated. The cost of treasury stock shares reacquired is charged to a contra account, in this case a contra
equity account that reduces the stockholder equity balance.
78

INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The provision for income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred taxes area accounted for using the balance sheet
liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income taxes are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case
the deferred tax is also adjusted in the equity accounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. ASC 740 also prescribes a more-
likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. ASC
740 also provides guidance related to, among other things, classification, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and
disclosure requirements. Any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded in tax expense.
5. POLITICAL AND BUSINESS RISK
The Company's operations are carried out in the PRC Accordingly, the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations may be
influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC's economy. The Company's operations
in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western
Europe. The Company's results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-
inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment”, long-lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company reviews the carrying amount of its
long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment, at the end of each fiscal year. An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash
flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the carrying amount of such asset is considered not recoverable, the asset is
adjusted to its fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flow.
79

EARNINGS PER SHARE
As prescribed in ASC Topic 260 “Earning per Share,” Basic Earnings per Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential
dilutive instruments such as stock options and warrants. The effect of stock options on diluted EPS is determined through the application of the
treasury stock method, whereby proceeds received by the Company based on assumed exercises are hypothetically used to repurchase the
Company’s common stock at the average market price during the period.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic (loss)/earnings per share attributable to Sino Agro Food, Inc. and subsidiaries common
stockholders amounted to $(2.24) and $(0.21), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, diluted (loss)/earnings per share
attributable to Sino Agro Food, Inc. and its subsidiaries’ common stockholders amounted to $(2.24) and $(0.21), respectively.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company is the Chinese Renminbi (RMB). For those
entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollars, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date; shareholder equity is translated at historical rates and items in the statements of income and of cash flows are translated at the
average rate for the period.
Because cash flows are translated based on the weighted average translation rate, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the
statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances in the balance sheets. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of equity.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020
Translation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income as incurred. The balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity
as of December 31 2020 and December 31, 2019 were translated at RMB6.52 to $1.00 and RMB6.98 to $1.00, respectively. The average translation
rates applied to the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
December 31 2019 were RMB6.90 to $1.00 and RMB6.87 to $1.00, respectively.
80

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019
Translation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency are included in the statements of income and comprehensive income as incurred. The balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity
as of December 31 2019 and December 31, 2018 were translated at RMB6.98 to $1.00 and RMB6.86 to $1.00, respectively. The average translation
rates applied to the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
December 31 2018 were RMB6.87 to $1.00 and RMB6.61 to $1.00, respectively.
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
ASC Topic 220 “Comprehensive Income” establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in stockholders’ equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The comprehensive income for all periods presented includes both the reported net
income and net change in cumulative translation adjustments.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS
PRC state managed retirement benefit programs are defined contribution plans and the payments to the plans are charged as expenses when
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company adopts both ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” and ASC Topic 505-50,”Equity-Based Payments to Non-
Employees” using the fair value method in which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from employees and non-
employees. Stock compensation for stock granted to non-employees has been determined in accordance with this accounting standard and the
accounting standard regarding accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with
selling goods or services, as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measured. This accounting standard allows the “simplified” method to determine the term of employee options when other information is not
available. Under ASC Topic 718 and ASC Topic 505-50, stock compensation expenses is measured at the grant date on the value of the option or
restricted stock and is recognized as expenses, less expected forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
81

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of
its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in
fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Company does not expect any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-
09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The
guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the
customers. The new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the company
has made when applying the guidance. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition
method. We finalized our analysis and the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which generally requires
companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This guidance will be
effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new standard
effective January 1, 2019. We have selected a lease accounting system and we are in the process of implementing such system as well as evaluating
the use of the optional practical expedients. While we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies, will be subject to the
new standard. We will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will
increase our total assets and liabilities.
82

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than
Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than
inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will adopt the new standard effective
January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers
involving assets other than inventory, new deferred tax assets, and other liabilities for amounts not currently recognized under U.S. GAAP. Based
on transactions up to December 31, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-
18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash
equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new
standard effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition approach for all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a
Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and
activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize
an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated
to that reporting unit. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We
do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt,
as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position, operating results or statements of cash flows.

6. GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Regulation of M&A and Overseas Listings
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce (the “MOFCOM”), the State Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”), the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (the “SAIC”), the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”), jointly issued the Regulations
on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and
was amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for
purposes of the overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain
the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.
On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official Website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose
vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC. The application of this new PRC regulation
remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval
requirement.
The M&A Rules also establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more
time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control
transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise.
In February 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and
Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (“Circular 6”), which established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions
of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors
having “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire “de facto control” of
domestic enterprises with “national security” concerns. In August 2011, the MOFCOM promulgated the Rules on Implementation of Security
Review System (the “MOFCOM Security Review Rules”), to replace the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on Matters Relating to the
Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by the
MOFCOM in March 2011. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, which came into effect on September 1, 2011, provide that the MOFCOM will look
into the substance and actual impact of a transaction and prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring
transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions.
Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (the “FX
Regulations”), which were last amended in August 2008. Under the FX Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items,
including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account
items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the
SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. On August 29, 2008, the SAFE issued a notice, Circular 142, regulating the
conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires
that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within
the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, the
SAFE increased its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign
currencies. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without the SAFE’s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if
the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines. As a result, Circular
142 may significantly limit our ability to transfer cash or other assets from The Company and/or our other non-PRC subsidiaries into our
subsidiaries in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business expansion and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds into RMB to invest
in or acquire any other PRC companies, or establish other variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in the PRC.
84

Dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas shareholder are deemed income of the shareholder and are taxable in the PRC. Pursuant to the
Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase or
remit foreign currency, subject to a cap approved by the SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of the SAFE.
Foreign currency transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE
and other relevant PRC governmental authorities.
In October 2005, the SAFE promulgated the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Corporate Financing
and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (“Circular 75”). Under Circular 75, which was issued by SAFE effective
November 1, 2005, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for
the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to the
registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore
enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the
capital of the offshore company. Moreover, Circular 75 applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who, prior to November 1, 2005, had
established or acquired control of offshore companies that had made onshore investments in the PRC prior to were required to complete the
relevant registration procedures with the local SAFE branch by March 31, 2006.
Since May 2007, the SAFE has issued a series of guidance to its local branches with respect to the operational process for the SAFE registration
under Circular 75. The guidance provides more specific and stringent supervision of the registration required by Circular 75. For example, the
guidance imposes obligations on onshore subsidiaries of an offshore entity to make true and accurate statements to the local SAFE authorities
regarding any shareholder or beneficial owner of the offshore entity who is a PRC citizen or resident. Untrue statements by the onshore
subsidiaries will lead to potential liability for the subsidiaries and, in some instances, for their legal representatives and other related individuals.
85

Under the relevant rules, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the
foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including increases in its registered capital, payment of dividends and other
distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and capital inflows from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties
under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. PRC residents who control our company from time to time are required to register with
the SAFE in connection with their investments in us.
On December 25, 2006, the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”) issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control and
related Implementation Rules were issued by the SAFE on January 5, 2007. Both became effective on February 1, 2007. Under these regulations,
all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan, or similar plan participated in by onshore
individuals may be conducted only with approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign
Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company (“Offshore Share Incentives
Rules”), which was issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted
shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and to comply with a series of other
requirements. If we, or the PRC employees of ours who hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares fail to comply with these
registration or other procedural requirements, we, and/or such employees may be subject to fines and other legal sanctions.
The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986),
which was amended in October 2000, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001). Under these regulations,
foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC
accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their
accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the
enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection
On June 29, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC (“Employment Contract Law”), which became
effective as of January 1, 2008, and was amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written
contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.
Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law
and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the
implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one
month after its implementation.
86

On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into
effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law.
As of December 31, 2015, we had entered written employment contracts with three of our employees.
Income Tax
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress approved and promulgated the Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”). On December 6,
2007, the State Council approved the Implementing Rules. Both the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules became effective on January 1, 2008.
Under the EIT Law and the Implementing Rules, which superseded the previous Income Tax Law, the enterprise income tax rate for both domestic
companies and foreign invested enterprises is unified at 25%. On December 26, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Circular on
Implementation of Enterprise Tax Transition Preferential Policy, or the Preferential Policy Circular. The EIT Law, its Implementing Rules and the
Preferential Policy Circular provide a five-year transitional period for certain entities that had enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25%
under the previous Income Tax Law and were established before March 16, 2007, during which period the applicable enterprises income tax rate
shall gradually increase to 25%.
On April 14, 2008, the Administration Measures for Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises, or the Recognition Measures, were
jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Finance, and the SAT, which sets out the standards and process for
granting the high and new technology enterprises status. According to the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules as well as the Recognition
Measures, enterprises which have been granted the high and new technology enterprises status shall enjoy a favorable income tax rate of 15%. The
new EIT Law and its Implementation Rules also provide that “software enterprises” enjoy a two-year income tax exemption starting from the first
profit making year, followed by a reduced tax rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years.
The EIT Law also provides that an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign country or region but whose “de facto management body” is in
the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its
global income. The Implementing Rules merely defines the location of the “de facto management body” as “the place where the exercising, in
substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC
company is located.” The SAT issued the Circular regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax
Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria
for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. The SAT
issued the Bulletin regarding the Administrative Measures on the Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises
(Interim) on July 27, 2011, which became effective on September 1, 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This
bulletin clarifies matters including resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although both
Circular 82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not companies like us, the determining criteria set
forth in Circular 82 and the bulletin may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in
determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Based on a
review of surrounding facts and circumstances, the Company does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be
considered a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history of the EIT Law, should the
Company be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax
rate of 25% retroactive to January 1, 2008.
87

The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a Foreign Invested Enterprise (an “FIE”) to its immediate
holding company outside of China if such immediate holding company is considered a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place
within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China,
unless such immediate holding company’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding
arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the previous law. The State of Nevada, where the Company is incorporated, does
not have such tax treaty with China. The SAT further promulgated a circular, or Circular 601, on October 27, 2009, which provides that the tax
treaty benefits will be denied to “conduit” or shell companies without business substance and that a beneficial ownership analysis will be used
based on a “substance-over-form” principle to determine whether to grant the tax treaty benefits. Most our subsidiaries in China are directly held
by our non-Chinese subsidiaries. If we are regarded as a non-resident enterprise and our non-Chinese subsidiaries are regarded as resident
enterprises, then our non-Chinese subsidiaries may be required to pay a 10% withholding tax on any dividends payable to us. If our non-Chinese
subsidiaries are regarded as non-resident enterprises, then our PRC subsidiaries may be required to pay a 5% withholding tax for any dividends
payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, however, it is still unclear at this stage whether Circular 601 applies to dividends from our PRC
subsidiaries paid to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, and if our non-Chinese subsidiaries were not considered as “beneficial owners” of any dividends
from their PRC subsidiaries, whether the dividends payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%.
The EIT Law and its Implementation Rules have tried to scrutinize transactions between related parties. Pursuant to the EIT Law and its
Implementation Rules, the tax authorities may impose mandatory adjustment on tax due to the extent a related party transaction is not in line with
arm’s-length principle or was entered with a purpose to reduce, avoid or delay the payment of tax. On January 8, 2009, the SAT issued the
Implementation Measures for Special Tax Adjustments (Trial), which clarifies the definition of “related party” and sets forth the tax-filing disclosure
and documentation requirements, the selection and application of transfer pricing methods, and transfer pricing investigation and assessment
procedures.
On December 10, 2009, the SAT issued a circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax Collection on Income Derived from
Equity Transfer by Non-resident Enterprise, or Circular 698. Pursuant to Circular 698, non-resident enterprises should declare any direct transfer
of equity interest of PRC resident enterprises and pay taxes in accordance with the EIT Law and relevant laws and regulations. For an indirect
transfer, if the effective tax rate for the transferor (a non-PRC-resident enterprise) is lower than 12.5% under the law of the jurisdiction of the
direct transferred target, the transferor is required to submit relevant transaction materials to PRC tax authorities for review. If such indirect
transfer is determined by PRC tax authorities to be a transaction without any reasonable business purpose other than for tax avoidance, the gains
derived from such transfer will be subject to PRC income tax.
88

In addition to the above, after the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules were promulgated, the SAT released several regulations to stipulate more
details for carrying out the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules. These regulations include:
• Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues Concerning the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax Deduction
and Exemption (2008);
• Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-resident
Enterprises’ Interest Income Sourcing from China (2008);
• Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Recognition of Incomes Subject to the Enterprise
Income Tax (2008);
• Opinion of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax (2008);
• Notice of the Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation on Several Preferential Policies in Respect of Enterprise
Income Tax (2008);
• Interim Measures for the Administration of Collection of Enterprise Income Tax on the Basis of Consolidation of Trans-regional
Business Operations (2008);
• Several Issues Concerning the Enterprise Income Tax Treatment on Enterprise Reorganization (2009);
• Circular of the State Council on Printing and Distributing Policies for Further Encouraging the Development of the Software
Industry and the Integrated Circuit Industry (2011); and
• Circular on Income Tax Policies for Further Encouraging the Development of Software Industry and Integrated Circuit Industry
(2012).

As of the date of this annual report, SIAF basically is already delinquent in its Form 10-Ks for fiscal year end 2019 and 2020, Form 10-Qs for
periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020, and March 31, 2021. It will need to amend and restate filings going back to
December 31, 2019. As such, based on legal advice, SAIF, rather than filing a delinquent and non-compliant Form 10-K, files a Form 8-K to
make the unaudited and un-reviewed financial statements publicly available and that SIAF continues to file the 12b-25 as required.
90

On 21st June 2021 the Form 8 K of the 2020 annual report was filed.
Tentative time schedules for the filing of Form 8K for the following financial reports:
On or before 15th August 2021, the Company targets to file the Form 8K of the half yearly report 2021.
On or before 31st March 2022, the company targets to file the Form 8K of the annual report 2022.
2.2.Audited financial reporting (restatements of financials)
As it was reported earlier that the Company’s auditors, which are located in Hong Kong, have been unable to do on-site inspections of the
Company’s operations in China due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing the completion of the 2019 and 2020 audited financials of the
Company. The prolonged effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic continue to interrupt our existing HK auditors’ plans to come to China and the
Company’s efforts in exploring the possibility of engaging alternative auditors have not been successful although there are discussions with
some of them are still in progress due primarily to that most of the said alternative auditors are presently fully occupied and requiring longer
time to understand and be familiar with the complexity of the Company’s financials.
However, the Company is hoping that the Covid-19 Pandemic 2020 will be controlled effectively sometimes within September 2021 due to the
encouraging results of the vaccination programs in China, Hong Kong as well as globally. If so, tentatively the Company is targeting to file following
reports as follows:
On or before 30th November 2021 --- “the Restatement of audited financials for fiscal year 2019 and 2020” to allow the Company to get back onto
the OTCQB within December 2021.
On or before 31st December 2021 --- “the auditors’ reviewed quarterly financials (10 Q1, Q2and Q3 2021)”--- this will also mean that the Company
will have caught up to date on all late fillings of financial reports.
On or before 15th May 2022 --- “the 10K 2021 audited financials” within the official required filing days of the 10K 2021 financial reports to allow
the Company to get back onto OTCQX accordingly.
2.3.The IPO exercise of the Company’s G series preferred shares:
The contemplated offering of Series G Non-Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred shares (the “G Series”) is meant to reduce the
Company’s outstanding shares, as the G Series shares are to be offered to the Company’s shareholders in exchange for the Company’s common
stock as well as to be offered to any investors and shareholders targeting to raise US$40 million for the working capital needs of the Company. The
Company has already filed Forms S-1 and S-4 with the SEC regarding the G Series and has received comments from the SEC on those filings.
However, the Company has determined that, given the Company’s current condition, now is not an appropriate time to go forward with the G
Series offering but if the Covid-19 Pandemic 2020 will be controlled effectively by September 2021, it will improve the opportunity and chances for
the Company to reactivate the IPO exercise of the G series shares starting from December 2021.
91

2.4.The distribution of Triway’s shares
Execution of a share dividend distribution of 18.3 million Tri-way ordinary shares to shareholders of record, originally announced in 2018 and the
Company has taken the following steps toward accomplishing the share distribution: it has prepared a draft Form F-1; engaged legal counsel to
provide advice on the transaction; investigated the tax implications of the transaction; and evaluated the practicability of the transaction given the
Company’s current financial condition.
Three main issues make it impracticable to execute the share distribution now. First, the Company understands that there are potential negative
tax consequences that would arise from the transaction. Second, the Company estimates that it would cost nearly $200,000 to complete the
transaction, including fees to consultants, the transfer agent, etc. Given the Company’s difficult financial condition, as explained above, the share
distribution is simply not practicable at this time.
Third, the Company’s auditors, which are located in Hong Kong, have been unable to do on-site inspections of the Company’s operations in China
due to COVID-19 restrictions. This fact also makes it difficult to complete this type of complex financial transaction. Additionally, SIAF explored the
potential for issuing a smaller share dividend consisting of fewer than 18.3 million shares, but again determined that this was impracticable.
However, the Company remains committed to completing the share distribution and will do so as soon as practicable. Furthermore, if the Covid-19
Pandemic 2020 will be controlled effectively by September 2021 it will improve the possibility to continue the share dividend distribution of 18.3
million Tri-way ordinary shares to shareholders of record within January 2022.

13. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures have improved but yet were not deemed effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of such period. This conclusion was
based on the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting related, but which may or may not be entirely exclusive,
to our accounting for disposal of assets resulting from discontinued operations, as described below.
92

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
or board override of the control.
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our consolidated and combined financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, he used the framework included in Internal Control — Integrated 2013
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth
in Internal Control — Integrated 2013 Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,
2016, our internal control over financial reporting had not been effective due to the identification of a material weakness related, but which may or
may not be entirely exclusive, to our controls over our accounting for disposal of assets related to discontinued operations. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
93

Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness
To remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described above, that Company has initiated implementing new
control procedures regarding our accounting for reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposal of asset components, specifically
regarding ‘timely disclosure’ on matters related to Discontinued Operations. The changes to the control environment include, but are not limited to,
the following:
• For future disposition of assets and / or discontinued operations, the Company has retained ECOVIS Financial Accounting specialists to
augment internal resources utilized for due diligence and analysis of the technical accounting aspects of the transaction. Such resources will be
retained by management at the direction of the audit committee.
• For future disposition of assets and / or discontinued operations, the Company will prepare an accounting memorandum for each disposal to
address the guidance outlined in ASC 205-20 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements — Discontinued Operations’ as necessary, as well as further
educate itself regarding matters of disposition / discontinued operations through related accounting literature, that will be reviewed by the Chief
Financial Officer and presented to the audit committee.
• We recently appointed two new directors, both of whom will serve on the Audit Committee. We expect appointing these individuals will
augment our ability to ameliorate any weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
• Presently, Solomon Lee serves as both our Chief Executive Officer and our interim Chief Financial Officer due to the unfortunate passing of
Daniel Ritchey, our former Chief Financial Officer, as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on December 4, 2018.
We are conducting a search for a suitable replacement for Mr. Ritchey but have not yet identified a candidate. We expect that appointing a new
chief financial officer will augment our ability to ameliorate any weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
These remediation initiatives are intended to enhance the Company’s timely disclosure by establishing a formal process and specific control
activities regarding disposition of assets / discontinued operations. Management believes that these measures, currently being implemented, will
remediate the deficiency identified. Other than as noted above, other changes may be implemented in the future to enhance and improve the
Company’s ICFR measures to prevent this deficiency from recurring.
However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period and the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Independent Audit Committee, and Independent Auditor have concluded, through testing, that
these controls are operating effectively.
94

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as described above, there were no other deficiencies discovered in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter
period ended December 31, 2016 and throughout all periods of FY2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
our internal control over financial reporting.

18. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
The following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially based on 60,352,942
issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020 by: (i) each of our directors; (ii) each of our named executive officers; and
(iii) each person or Company known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
100

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.
Other than as described in the notes to the table, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to shares beneficially owned by them. All share ownership figures include shares issuable upon exercise of options or warrants exercisable
within 60 days of the date of this Annual Report, which are deemed outstanding and beneficially owned by such person for purposes of computing
his or her percentage ownership, but not for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

(3) We believe, based on a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on January 4, 2019, that the reporting person Iliad Management, LLC is the
General Partner of reporting person Iliad. Iliad has rights, under a convertible promissory note, to own an aggregate number of shares of our
common stock which, except for a contractual cap on the amount of outstanding shares that Iliad may own, would exceed such a cap. Iliad's current
ownership in % of common stocks is 5.47% after the equivalent of US$200,000.00 in cash and / or shares for repayments during year 2019. Thus,
the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Iliad as of 31st December 2019, was 2,736,292 shares, which is 5.47% of the
49,963,607shares outstanding on December 31, 2019.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
Sino Agro Food, Inc. (the “ Company” or “SIAF”) (formerly known as Volcanic Gold, Inc. and A Power Agro Agriculture Development, Inc.) was
incorporated on October 1, 1974 in the State of Nevada, United States of America.
The Company was engaged in the mining and exploration business but ceased its mining and exploring business on October 14, 2005. On
August 24, 2007, the Company entered into a Merger and Acquisition Agreement with Capital Award Inc., a Belize corporation (“CA”) and its
subsidiaries Capital Stage Inc. (“CS”) and Capital Hero Inc. (“CH”). Effective the same date, CA completed a reverse merger transaction with
SIAF. SIAF acquired all the outstanding common stock of CA from Capital Adventure, a shareholder of CA, for 3,232,323 shares of the
Company’s common stock.
On August 24, 2007 the Company changed its name from Volcanic Gold, Inc. to A Power Agro Agriculture Development, Inc. On December 8,
2007, the Company changed its name to Sino Agro Food, Inc.
On September 5, 2007, the Company acquired three existing businesses in the People’s Republic of China (the “P.R.C.”):
(a) Hang Yu Tai Investment Limited (“HYT”), a company incorporated in Macau, the owner of 78% equity interest in ZhongXingNongMu Ltd
(“ZX”), a company incorporated in the P.R.C.;
(b) Tri-Way Industries Limited (“TRW”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong; and
(c) Macau Eiji Company Limited (“MEIJI”), a company incorporated in Macau, the owner of 75% equity interest in Enping City Juntang Town
Hang Sing Tai Agriculture Co. Ltd. (“HST”), a P.R.C. corporate Sino-Foreign joint venture. HST was dissolved in 2010.
On November 27, 2007, MEIJI and HST established a corporate Sino - Foreign joint venture, Jiang Men City Heng Sheng Tai Agriculture
Development Co. Ltd. (“JHST”), a company incorporated in the P.R.C. with MEIJI owning a 75% interest and HST owning a 25% interest.
On November 26, 2008, SIAF established Pretty Mountain Holdings Limited (“PMH”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong with an 80%
equity interest. On May 25, 2009, PMH formed a corporate Sino-Foreign joint venture, Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co. Ltd. (“SJAP”),
incorporated in the P.R.C., of which PMH owns a 45% equity interest. At the time, the remaining 55% equity interest in SJAP was owned by the
following entities:
• Qinghai Province Sanjiang Group Company Limited (English translation) (“Qinghai Sanjiang”), a company incorporated in the P.R.C with
major business activities in the agriculture industry; and
• Guangzhou City Garwor Company Limited (English translation) (“Garwor”), a company incorporated in the P.R.C., specializing in sales and
marketing.
SJAP is engaged in the business of manufacturing bio-organic fertilizer, livestock feed and development of other agriculture projects in the
County of Huangyuan, in the vicinity of the Xining City, Qinghai Province, P.R.C.
In September 2009, the Company carried out an internal reorganization of its corporate structure and business, and formed a 100% owned
subsidiary, A Power Agro Agriculture Development (Macau) Limited (“APWAM”), which was formed in Macau. APWAM then acquired PMH’s
45% equity interest in SJAP. By virtue of the acquisition, APWAM assumed all obligations and liabilities of PMH under the Sino Foreign Joint
Venture Agreement. On May 7, 2010, Qinghai Sanjiang sold and transferred its equity interest in SJAP to Garwor. The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce of Xining City Government of the PRC approved the sale and transfer. As a result, APWAM owned 45% of SJAP and

2019, Mr. Solomon Lee resigned as the Chairman of SJAP resulting in categorization of SJAP as an Investor in Associate from a subsidiary
status.
Up until September 30th 2019, revenues have been generated from activities that the Company divided into five stand-alone business divisions
or units: (1) Fishery development (in consulting and services), (2) Cattle & Beef (fully integrated activity), (3) Organic Fertilizer, (4) HU
Plantation, and (5) Marketing and Trading.
The fully integrated Cattle and Beef business was gradually being scaled down from year 2016 onward after the China Government relaxed its
importation policies to allow many countries (i.e. Australia, NZ, Countries of South America and Canada etc.) to import beef into China affecting
its domestic cattle rearing and beef industry. SJAP lost in excessive of US$30 million by year ended December 31st 2017 and by June 30th 2019,
it reduced its large fully integrated activity into a small operation keeping and maintaining the production of fertilizer at less than 8,000 MT per
year comparing to over 35,000 MT per year in 2015 and the production of concentrated live-stock feed at less than 3000 MT per year compares
to over 15,000 MT in 2016 and fattening less than 1500 heads of live cattle at its own farm compares to 2015’s around 25,000 heads of live
cattle reared and fattening by 20 corporative farms that consisted over 2,000 individual farmers collectively.
From 1st October 2019 onward, SJAP contracted the said small maintaining operation to its existing management.

The Company currently maintains operations of its services in engineering consulting and specializing in the development of agriculture and
aquaculture projects whereas operations of its HU Plantation, Asian “Yellow cattle” demonstration farm, and HSA’s manufacturing of fertilizer
were contracted out to their respective farm’s management since 30th September 2019.
The Company is now the investor in two Associates originated from subsidiary status namely SJAP and Tri-way; whereas Tri-way is in the
aquaculture segment contracting out it’s aqua-farms’ operations (inclusive Aqua-farm 1, 2 and 3 & b) to respective farm’s managements and
JFD, it’s fully owned subsidiary in China, has the sole right to market and distribute the said Aqua-farms’ productions by buying from and selling
all fishery productions of the said contracted aqua-farms. Operation of Aqua-farm 4 and 5 of the Zhongshen Mega Farm Development ceased
since September 30th 2019 failing the Company’s original ambition to become one of the biggest prawn producers in the world by year end of
2024.
Therefore from 1st October 2019 onward, Revenues of the Company are generated from (i). Incomes derived from CA’s Engineering Consulting
and services, (ii). Incomes derived from the contractual agreements of JHST, MEIJI and HSA, (iii). CA’s (or the Corporate) marketing and
Trading business and (iv). Incomes generated from its investments in SJAP and Tri-way.
The Company’s principal executive office is located at Room 3520 Block A, China Shine Plaza, No. 9 Lin He Xi Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou

2.3BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (“US GAAP”).
2.4BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries CA, CS, CH, MEIJI, JHST, JHMC,
HSA, APWAM, SAFS and its variable interest entity SJAP. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.
SIAF, CA, CS, CH, MEIJI, JHST, JHMC, HSA, APWAM, SAFS, and SJAP are hereafter referred to as (the “Company”).
2.5BUSINESS COMBINATION
The Company adopted the accounting pronouncements relating to business combination (primarily contained in ASC Topic 805 “Business
Combinations”), including assets acquired and liabilities assumed on arising from contingencies. These pronouncements established
principles and requirement for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquisition as well as provides guidance for recognizing and
measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. In addition, these pronouncements eliminate the
distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies, including the initial recognition and measurement criteria and require
an acquirer to develop a systematic and rational basis for subsequently measuring and accounting for acquired contingencies depending on
their nature. The Company’s adoption of these pronouncements will have an impact on the manner in which it accounts for any future
acquisitions.
2.6NON - CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company adopted the accounting pronouncement on non-controlling interests in consolidated financial statements, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance
is primarily contained in ASC Topic “Consolidation.” It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated financial statements. The adoption of this standard has not had material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
2.7USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered thereby. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in certain
areas. The following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: determinations of the useful lives of assets,
estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived
assets, estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets and inventory reserves.

2.8REVENUE RECOGNITION
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaces
numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry specific requirements, and provides a single revenue recognition model for
recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018.
The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
This requires companies to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in
time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenues generated mainly from
trading of frozen food and sales of agricultural products are recognized at a point in time.
The ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the
Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the
transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in
significant changes in the way the Company records its revenues.
Multiple-Element Arrangements
To qualify as a separate unit of accounting under ASC 605-25 “Multiple Element Arrangements”, the delivered item must have value to the
customer on a standalone basis. The significant deliverables under the Company’s multiple-element arrangements are consulting and
service under development contract, commission and management service.
Revenues from the Company’s consulting and services under development contracts are performed under fixed-price contracts. Revenues
under long-term contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”). Under the
percentage-of- completion method, the Company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost
of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term. The percentage of costs incurred determines the amount of revenue to be
recognized. Payment terms are generally defined by the installation contract and as a result may not match the timing of the costs incurred
by the Company and the related recognition of revenue. Such differences are recorded as either costs or estimated earnings in excess of
billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. The Company determines
a customer’s credit worthiness at the time an order is accepted. Sudden and unexpected changes in a customer’s financial condition could
put recoverability at risk.
The percentage of completion method requires the ability to estimate several factors, including the ability of the customer to meet its
obligations under the contract, including the payment of amounts when due. If the Company determines that collectability is not assured,
the Company will defer revenue recognition and use methods of accounting for the contract such as the completed contract method until
such time as the Company determines that collectability is reasonably assured or through the completion of the project.
For fixed-price contracts, the Company uses the ratio of costs incurred to date on the contract to management’s estimate of the contract’s
total costs, to determine the percentage of completion on each contract. This method is used as management considers expended costs to be
the best available measure of progression of these contracts. Contract costs include all direct material, subcontract and labor costs and
those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as supplies, tool repairs and depreciation. The Company accounts for
maintenance and repair services under the guidance of ASC 605 as the services provided relate to construction work. Contract costs
incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in job performance,
job conditions, and estimated profitability arising from contract penalty, change orders and final contract settlements may result in revisions
to the estimated profit ability during the contract. These changes, which include contracts with estimated costs in excess of estimated
revenues, are recognized as contract costs in the period in which the revisions are determined. Profit incentives are included in revenues
when their realization is reasonably assured. At the point the Company anticipates a loss on a contract, the Company estimates the ultimate
loss through completion and recognizes that loss in the period in which the loss was identified.
F-12

The Company does not provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry, however, customers can claim warranty
directly from product manufacturers for defects in equipment or products. Historically, the Company has experienced no warranty claims.
The Company provides various management services to its customers in the P.R.C. based on a negotiated fixed-price contract. The clients
usually pay the fees when the services contract is signed and services are rendered. The Company recognizes these services-based revenues
from contracts when (i) management services are rendered; (ii) clients recognize the completion of services; and (iii) collectability is
reasonably assured. Fees received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue under current liabilities.

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct purchase cost of merchandise goods, and related levies. Cost of services consist primarily
direct cost and indirect cost incurred to date for development contracts and provision for anticipated losses for development contracts.
2.10 SHIPPING AND HANDLING
Shipping and handling costs related to cost of goods sold are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0 and
$156,103 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
2.11 ADVERTISING
Advertising costs are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0, and $956,056 for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
2.12 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Research and development expenses are included in general and administrative expenses, which totaled $0 and $855,167 for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
2.13 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company is the Chinese Renminbi (RMB).
For those entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollars, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date; shareholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and items in the statements of income and
of cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period. Because cash flows are translated based on the average translation rate,
amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the
corresponding balances in the balance sheets. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the statements of shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations
on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statements of income and
comprehensive income, as incurred.
Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity amounted to $ (54,997,545) as of
December 31, 2020 and $(59,011,769) as of December 31, 2019. The balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity as of
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were translated using an exchange rate of RMB 6.52 to $1.00 and RMB 6.98 to $1.00,
respectively. The average translation rates applied to the statements of income and other comprehensive income and of cash flows for
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were RMB 6.90 to $1.00 and RMB 6.87to $1.00, respectively.
2.14 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents kept with financial institutions in the P.R.C. are not insured or otherwise protected. Should any of those
institutions holding the Company’s cash become insolvent, or should the Company become unable to withdraw funds for any reason, the
Company could lose the cash on deposit with that institution.
2.15 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts
receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific
identification basis.
The standard credit period for most of the Company’s clients is three months. The collection period over 1 year is classified as long-term
accounts receivable. Management evaluates the collectability of the receivables at least quarterly.

2.16 INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) and net realizable value. Costs incurred in bringing
each product to its location and conditions are accounted for as follows:
(a) raw materials - purchase cost on a weighted average basis;
(b) manufactured finished goods and work-in-progress - cost of direct materials and labor and a proportion of manufacturing overhead
based on normal operation capacity but excluding borrowing costs; and
(c) retail and wholesale merchandise finished goods - purchase cost on a weighted average basis.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs for completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.17 PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Such costs include the
cost of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalization when the cost of replacing the parts is incurred. Similarly, when each major
inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement only if it is eligible for
capitalization. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each
financial year end.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Plant and machinery 5 - 10 years
Structure and leasehold improvements 10 - 30 years
Mature seeds and herbage cultivation 20 years
Furniture and equipment 2.5 - 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 - 10 years
An item of plant and equipment is removed from the accounts upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on disposal of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the consolidated statements of income in the period the item is
disposed.
2.18 GOODWILL
Goodwill is an asset representing the fair economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not
individually identified or separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the end of the Company’s fiscal
year, or when impairment indicators arise. The Company uses a fair-value-based approach to test for impairment at the level of each
reporting unit. The Company directly acquired MEIJI, which is the holding company of JHST that operates the Hu Plantation. As a result
of this acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of $724,940. This goodwill represents the fair value of the assets
acquired in these acquisitions over the cost of the assets acquired.

2.19 PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES
A master license of stock feed manufacturing technology was acquired and the costs of acquisition are capitalized as proprietary
technologies when technological feasibility has been established. Cost of acquisition of stock feed manufacturing technology master
license is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated life of 25 years.
An aromatic cattle-feeding formula was acquired and the costs of acquisition are capitalized as proprietary technologies when
technological feasibility has been established. Cost of acquisition on aromatic cattle-feeding formula is amortized using the straight-line
method over its estimated life of 20 years.
The cost of sleepy cods breeding technology license is capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological feasibility has been
established. Cost of granting sleepy cods breeding technology license is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated life
of 25 years.
Bacterial cellulose technology license and related trade mark are capitalized as proprietary technologies when technological feasibility
has been established. Cost of license and related trade mark is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated life of 20
years.
The Company has determined that technological feasibility is established at the time a working model of products is completed.
Proprietary technologies are intangible assets of finite lives. Management evaluates the recoverability of proprietary technologies on an
annual basis at the end of the Company’s fiscal year, or when impairment indicators arise. As required by ASC Topic 350 “Intangible -
Goodwill and Other”, the Company uses a fair-value-based approach to test for impairment.
2.20 CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
Construction in progress represents direct costs of construction as well as acquisition and design fees incurred. Capitalization of these
costs ceases and the construction in progress is transferred to property and equipment when substantially all the activities necessary to
prepare the assets for their intended use are completed. No depreciation is provided until construction is completed and the asset is
ready for its intended use.
2.21 LAND USE RIGHTS
Land use rights represent acquisition of rights to agricultural land from farmers and are amortized on the straight-line basis over their
respective lease periods. The lease period of agricultural land is in the range from 10 to 60 years. Land use rights purchase prices were
determined in accordance with the P.R.C. Government’s minimum lease payments on agricultural land and mutually agreed to terms
between the Company and the vendors.
2.22 EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
Investee entities, in which the company can exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the company’s share of the earnings or losses of these companies is included in net
income. A loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized as a charge to operations. Evidence of a
loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the
investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.
2.23 CORPORATE JOINT VENTURE
A corporation formed, owned, and operated by two or more businesses as a separate and discrete business or project (venture) for their
mutual benefit is considered to be a corporate joint venture. Investee entities, in which the Company can exercise significant influence,
but not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s share
of the earnings or losses of these companies is included in net income.

(b) as a group, the equity-at-risk holders cannot control the entity; or
(c) the economics do not coincide with the voting interest.
If a firm is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the holdings must be disclosed on the balance sheet. The primary beneficiary is defined as
the person or company with the majority of variable interests. A corporation formed, owned, and operated by two or more businesses
(ventures) as a separate and discrete business or project (venture) for their mutual benefit is defined as a joint venture.
2.25 TREASURY STOCK
Treasury stock means shares of a corporation’s own stock that have been issued and subsequently reacquired by the corporation.
Converting outstanding shares to treasury shares does not reduce the number of shares issued but does reduce the number of shares
outstanding. These shares are not eligible to receive dividends. Accounting for excesses and deficiencies on treasury stock transactions
is governed by ASC 505-30-30.
State laws and federal agencies closely regulate transactions involving a company’s own capital stock, so the purchase of outstanding
shares must have a legitimate purpose. Some of the most common reasons for purchasing outstanding shares are as follows:
(a) to meet additional stock needs for various reasons, including newly implemented stock option plans, stock for convertible bonds or
convertible preferred stock, or a stock dividend.
(b) to make more shares available for acquisitions of other entities.
The cost method of accounting for treasury shares has been adopted by the Company. The purchase of outstanding shares and thus
converting them into treasury shares is treated as a temporary reduction in shareholders’ equity in view of the expectation to reissue the
shares instead of retiring them. When the Company reissues the treasury shares, the temporary account is eliminated. The cost of
acquiring outstanding shares for converting into treasury shares is charged to a contra account, in this case a contra equity account that
reduces the stockholder equity balance.
2.26 INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under ASC Topic 740,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The provision for income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is accounted for using
the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle,
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
F-17

Deferred income taxes are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is
settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it related to items credited or charged directly to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
ASC Topic 740 also prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken, or for one expected to be taken, in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance related to, among other things,
classification, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and disclosure requirements. Any interest and
penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as tax expense.

2.27 POLITICAL AND BUSINESS RISK
The Company’s operations are carried out in the P.R.C. Accordingly, the political, economic and legal environment in the P.R.C. may
influence the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations by the general state of the P.R.C.’s economy. The
Company’s operations in the P.R.C. are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in
North America and Western Europe. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect
to laws and regulations, anti- inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation,
among other things.
2.28 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Cash includes cash at banks and demand deposits in accounts maintained with banks within the P.R.C. Total cash in these banks as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $185,895 and $4,950,799, respectively, none of which is covered by insurance. The Company
has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks to its cash in bank accounts.

2.29 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” long-lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company reviews
the carrying amount of its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment, during each reporting period. An asset is considered
impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the carrying amount of such
asset is considered not recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on discounted future
cash flow. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company determined no impairment losses were necessary.
2.30 EARNINGS PER SHARE
As prescribed in ASC Topic 260 “Earnings per Share,” Basic Earnings per Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed
by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding during
the year plus potential dilutive instruments such as stock options and warrants. The effect of stock options on diluted EPS is determined
through the application of the treasury stock method, whereby proceeds received by the Company based on assumed exercises are
hypothetically used to repurchase the Company’s common stock at the average market price during the period.
ASC 260-10-55 requires that stock dividends or stock splits be accounted for retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur
during the year, or retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur after the end of the period but before the release of the
financial statements, by considering it outstanding of the entirety of each period presented. Dilution is computed by applying the
treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the
time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the
year.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to Sino Agro Food, Inc. and subsidiaries
common stockholders amounted to $(2.24), and $(0.21), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, diluted
earnings (loss) per share attributable to Sino Agro Food, Inc. and its subsidiaries’ common stockholders amounted to $(2.24), and
$(0.21), respectively.
2.31 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
ASC Topic 220 “Comprehensive Income” establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components
in financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in stockholders’ equity of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. The comprehensive income for all periods presented
includes both the reported net income and net change in cumulative translation adjustments.
2.32 RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS
P.R.C. state managed retirement benefit programs are defined contribution plans and the payments to the plans are charged as
expenses when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution made by the employer.
2.33 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted both ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” and ASC Topic 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments
to Non - Employees” using the fair value method in which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from
employees and non- employees. Stock compensation for stock granted to non-employees has been determined in accordance with this
accounting standard and the accounting standard regarding accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees
for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling goods or services, as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. This accounting standard allows the “simplified” method to determine the
term of employee options when other information is not available. Under ASC Topic 718 and ASC Topic 505-50, stock compensation
expenses is measured at the grant date on the value of the option or restricted stock and is recognized as expenses, less expected
forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.

2.34 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its
financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S.
GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy
defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, Deposits and prepayments, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, other payables, due to a director and income tax payables. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term nature. The
Company’s long-term borrowing, promissory notes and convertible notes payable approximates the fair value of such instrument based
upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangement at
December 31, 2019. It is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to any significant currency or credit risks arising from
these financial instruments.
The Company revalues its derivative liability at every reporting period and recognizes gains or losses in the consolidated statement of
income and other comprehensive income that are attributable to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability. The Company has
no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
2.35 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which aims to make leasing activities more transparent and comparable and
requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability,
including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. This ASU is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-
02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07—Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-
Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have
on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2.36 RECLASSIFICATION

restructure the indebtedness represented by Note 1 as follows: (a) SIAF issues 5,196,333 shares of its common stock and transfer 400,000
shares of TRW to the note holder; and (b) SIAF executes a new promissory note in the principal amount of $15,589,000 to the note holder to be
paid in installments over a period of time. However, both parties remain open to negotiate an all-cash settlement of the Note 1.

$29,367,999 (see Note 21) and a loss on restructuring of $6,225,204 which representing the non-amortized part of the discount upon the

(iii). There were 500,050 Common Shares of the Company loaned to the said accredited investor on (Date: July 22, 2014) valued at US$18.10 /
share as security for the accredited investors to secure their investors to invest on the Bond prior to the completion of a registration statement

Company as part of the Note 1’s disbursement to the Company making total disbursement sum of US$22,137,450.00 being advanced to the

accredited investor and the Company, the sales proceeds (of US$13,362,550.00) from the sales of the 500,050 shares loaned in good faith to
ECAB must be taken into consideration and be deduced from the said principal amount before this bond arrangements can be settled.
