PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
Markel Corporation is a diverse financial holding company serving a variety of niche markets. We aspire to build one of the world's great companies
and deploy three financial engines in pursuit of this goal.
Insurance - Our principal business markets and underwrites specialty insurance products using multiple platforms that enable us to best
match risk and capital.
Investments - Our investing activities are primarily related to our underwriting operations. The majority of our investable assets come from
premiums paid by policyholders and the remainder is comprised of shareholder funds.
Markel Ventures - Through our Markel Ventures operations, we own controlling interests in a diverse portfolio of businesses that operate in a
variety of industries.
Our financial goals are to earn consistent underwriting and operating profits and superior investment returns to build shareholder value. We measure
financial success by our ability to grow book value per common share and the market price per common share of our stock, or total shareholder
return, at high rates of return over a long period of time. To mitigate effects of short-term volatility and align with the longer-term perspective we
apply to operating our businesses, we generally use five-year time periods to measure our performance. Growth in book value per common share is
an important measure of our success because it includes all underwriting, operating and investing results. Over the past five years, the compound
annual growth in book value per common share was 6%. Growth in total shareholder value is also an important measure of our success, as a
significant portion of our operations are not recorded at fair value or otherwise captured in book value. Over the past five years, our common share
price increased at a compound annual rate of 3%. While these measures, considered independently of other factors, fall below our internal targets,
we remain confident in the strong operating performance of our businesses.
The following graph presents book value per common share and stock price per common share for the past five years as of December 31.

Insurance
Our insurance engine is comprised of the following types of operations:
• Underwriting - Our underwriting operations are comprised of our risk-bearing insurance and reinsurance operations.
• Insurance-linked securities - Our insurance-linked securities (ILS) operations provide investment management services for a variety of
investment products, including insurance-linked securities, catastrophe bonds, insurance swaps and weather derivatives.
• Program services - Our program services business serves as a fronting platform that provides other insurance entities access to the United
States (U.S.) property and casualty insurance market.
Through our underwriting, ILS and program services operations, we have a suite of capabilities through which we can access capital to support our
customers' risks, which includes our own capital through our underwriting operations, as well as third-party capital through our ILS and program
services operations. Within each of these insurance platforms, we believe that our specialty product focus and niche market strategy enable us to
develop expertise and specialized market knowledge. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors by our expertise, service, continuity and
other value-based considerations, including the multiple platforms through which we can manage risk and deploy capital. For example, through our
program services platform, we have programs through which we write insurance policies on behalf of our ILS operations that are supported by third-
party capital. Additionally, we cede certain risks written through our underwriting operations to our ILS operations to the extent those risks are more
aligned with the risk profile of our ILS investors than our own corporate tolerance. Our ability to access multiple insurance platforms allows us to
achieve income streams from our insurance operations beyond the traditional underwriting model. We believe this multi-platform approach provides
us with a unique
10K - 3

advantage through which we have the ability to unlock additional value for our customers and business partners, which we refer to as "the power of
the platform."
Underwriting
Specialty Insurance and Reinsurance
Within our underwriting operations, we underwrite specialty insurance products on a risk-bearing basis. The specialty insurance market differs
significantly from the standard market. In the standard market, insurance rates and forms are highly regulated, products and coverages are largely
uniform with relatively predictable exposures and companies tend to compete for customers on the basis of price. In contrast, the specialty market
provides coverage for hard-to-place risks that generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard carriers.
Competition in the specialty insurance market tends to focus less on price than in the standard insurance market and more on other value-based
considerations, such as availability, service and expertise. While specialty market exposures may have higher perceived insurance risks than their
standard market counterparts, we seek to manage these risks and achieve higher financial returns. To reach our financial and operational goals, we
must have extensive knowledge and expertise in our chosen markets. Many of our larger accounts are considered on an individual basis where
customized forms and tailored solutions are employed.
By focusing on the distinctive risk characteristics of our insureds, we have been able to identify a variety of niche markets where we can add value
with our specialty product offerings and alternative platforms through which we can access capital to support our customers' risks. Examples of niche
insurance markets that we have targeted include liability coverage for highly specialized professionals, wind and earthquake-exposed commercial
properties, equine-related risks, transaction-related risks, classic cars, credit and surety-related risks, collateral protection risks and marine, energy
and environmental-related activities. Our market strategy in each of these areas of specialization is tailored to the unique nature of the loss
exposure, coverage and services required by insureds. In each of our niche markets, we assign teams of experienced underwriters and claims
specialists who provide a full range of insurance services.
We also participate in the reinsurance market in certain classes of reinsurance product offerings, primarily casualty lines and certain other specialty
lines. In the reinsurance market, our clients are other insurance companies, or cedents. We typically write our reinsurance products in the form of
treaty reinsurance contracts, which are contractual arrangements that provide for automatic reinsuring of a type or category of risk underwritten by
cedents. Generally, we participate in reinsurance treaties with a number of other reinsurers, each with an allocated portion of the treaty, with the
terms and conditions of the treaty being substantially the same for each participating reinsurer. With treaty reinsurance contracts, we do not
separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under the contracts and are largely dependent on the individual underwriting decisions
made by the cedent. Accordingly, we review and analyze the cedent's risk management and underwriting practices in deciding whether to provide
treaty reinsurance and in pricing of treaty reinsurance contracts.
Our reinsurance products are written globally on both a quota share and excess of loss basis. Quota share contracts require us to share the losses
and expenses in an agreed proportion with the cedent. Excess of loss contracts require us to indemnify the cedent against all or a specified portion of
losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar or percentage amount. Our reinsurance products may include features such as contractual
provisions that require our cedent to share in a portion of losses resulting from ceded risks, may require payment of additional premium amounts or
provide experience refunds if the losses we incur differ from those projected at the time of the execution of the contract or may require a
reinstatement premium to restore coverage after there has been a loss occurrence.
We distinguish ourselves in the reinsurance market by the expertise of our underwriting teams, our access to global reinsurance markets, our ability
to offer large capacity lines and our ability to customize reinsurance solutions to fit our cedents' needs. Additionally, as with our insurance
underwriting operations, our ability to access third-party capital through our ILS and program services platforms provides additional capital
alternatives to support certain risks, to the extent those risks do not align with our underwriting risk tolerance. For example, we do not write property
reinsurance business, including catastrophe-exposed property business, on a risk-bearing basis. Such business is only written on behalf of our ILS
operations, to the extent it matches the risk profile of our third-party ILS investors, who provide the capital to support the risk. See "Program Services
and Other Fronting" for further discussion of business written on behalf of our ILS operations.

Markets and Distribution
Our underwriting operations write business on a global basis and utilize multiple distribution channels to access our targeted risks.
In the U.S., we write business in the excess and surplus lines (E&S) and admitted insurance markets, as well as the reinsurance market. The primary
distribution channels through which our U.S. business is placed are wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers, retail insurance agents and
alternative channels that include third-party managing general agents.
The E&S, or non-admitted, market focuses on hard-to-place risks and loss exposures that generally are not written in the standard market. U.S.
insurance regulations generally require an E&S account to be declined by admitted carriers before an E&S company may write the business. E&S
eligibility allows our insurance subsidiaries to underwrite unique loss exposures with more flexible policy forms and unregulated premium rates. This
typically results in coverages that are more restrictive and more expensive than coverages in the standard market. The E&S market is accessed
primarily through wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers, which have limited quoting and binding authority. In 2021, the E&S market
represented $83 billion, or 10%, of the $798 billion U.S. property and casualty industry.1 In 2021, we were the third largest E&S writer in the U.S. as
measured by direct premium writings.1 Our E&S insurance operations are conducted through EIC.
Our U.S. business written in the admitted market focuses on unique and hard-to-place risks in the standard market, some of which must remain with
an admitted insurance company for marketing and regulatory reasons. Hard-to-place risks written in the admitted market cover insureds engaged in
similar, but highly specialized, activities that require a total insurance program not otherwise available from standard insurers or insurance products
that are overlooked by large admitted carriers. The admitted market is subject to more state regulation than the E&S market, particularly with regard
to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state
associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. Business written in the admitted market is placed primarily by retail insurance
agents. We are looking for opportunities to expand our business placed through retail insurance agents in order to capture additional business in the
admitted market that fits our risk profile. Our admitted business is also placed through managing general agents, which have broader underwriting
authority than retail agents. These agents are carefully selected based on a track record of proficiency with their selected products, and the business
written is controlled through regular audits and pre-approvals. In addition, certain products and programs written on an admitted basis are marketed
directly to consumers. The majority of our admitted insurance operations are conducted through MIC, MAIC, FCIC and Essentia. Our admitted
operations also include SIC, SNIC and NSIC.
Our U.S. reinsurance operations are conducted through MGRC. Reinsurance business is placed primarily through wholesale reinsurance brokers. We
were the 41st largest reinsurer in 2021 as measured by worldwide gross reinsurance premium writings.2
We also participate in the London insurance and reinsurance market, which is known for its ability to provide innovative, tailored coverage and
capacity for unique and hard-to-place risks. Hard-to-place risks in the London market are generally distinguishable from standard risks due to the
complexity or significant size of the risk. It is primarily a broker market, which means that insurance brokers bring most of the business to the
market. Risks written in this market are written on either a direct basis or a subscription basis, the latter of which means that loss exposures brought
into the market are typically insured by more than one insurance company or Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) syndicate, often due to the high limits of
insurance coverage required. When we write business in the subscription market, we prefer to participate as lead underwriter in order to control
underwriting terms, policy conditions and claims handling. We participate in the London insurance and reinsurance market primarily through Markel
Capital Limited (Markel Capital) and MIICL. Markel Capital is the corporate capital provider for Syndicate 3000, through which our Lloyd's operations
are conducted. Syndicate 3000 is managed by Markel Syndicate Management Limited. In addition to their headquarters in London, Markel Capital and
MIICL have offices across the United Kingdom (U.K.), Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East through which we are able to offer insurance and
reinsurance. The London insurance market produced approximately $94 billion of gross written premium in 2021, of which $53 billion was produced
by Lloyd's syndicates.3,4 In 2021, our share of the London market was approximately 2% as measured by gross written premiums.

In Bermuda, which is known for its significant concentration of insurance and reinsurance businesses, we participate in the worldwide insurance and
reinsurance markets. The Bermuda property and casualty market is a significant source of capital for the U.S. market and the leading location for
cessions by U.S. insurers.5 Business written in the Bermuda market is typically placed by a Bermuda-based wholesale broker. The Bermuda market
produced $83 billion of gross written premium in 2020.6 In 2020, our share of the Bermuda market was approximately 1% as measured by gross
written premiums in our underwriting operations. We conduct our Bermuda underwriting operations through MBL, which is registered as a Class 4
insurer and Class C long-term insurer under the insurance laws of Bermuda.
In Europe, we also write business through Syndicate 3000 and MISE, a regulated insurance carrier located in Munich, Germany. From its offices in
Germany, MISE transacts business in European Union (E.U.) member states and throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). MISE has established
branches in Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, France and the U.K. Syndicate 3000 supplements, or serves as an alternative to, MISE for
access to the E.U. markets.
While we operate in various other markets, substantially all of our gross written premiums in 2022 were written from our platforms in the United
States, United Kingdom, Bermuda and Germany. In 2022, 80% of gross premium writings from our global underwriting operations were attributed to
risks or cedents located in the United States. In each of the markets in which we operate, we seek to develop and capitalize on relationships with
insurance and reinsurance brokers, insurance and reinsurance companies, large global corporations and financial intermediaries to develop and
underwrite business. A significant volume of premium for the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry is produced through a small
number of large insurance and reinsurance brokers. In 2022, the top three independent brokers accounted for 28% of gross premiums written in our
underwriting segments. Additionally, a significant portion of the reinsurance contracts securitized through our ILS operations, for the benefit of third-
party investors, are placed through these three independent brokers.
Ceded Reinsurance
In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a premium. In a retrocessional
reinsurance transaction, a reinsured exposure is further ceded to another reinsurer. Within our underwriting operations, we seek to retain as much of
our profitable business as possible while managing volatility within our underwriting results. We purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance
to manage our net retention on individual risks and overall exposure to losses, while providing us with the ability to offer policies with sufficient limits
to meet policyholder needs. This includes purchasing sufficient coverage for our catastrophe-exposed policies to ensure that our net retained
catastrophe risk is within our corporate tolerances. Our exposure to catastrophe risk has been significantly reduced over the past two years with the
discontinuation of our retrocessional reinsurance business and the transition of our property reinsurance business from our underwriting operations
to our Nephila ILS operations, where it is placed with third-party capital. See "Program Services and Other Fronting" for further discussion of this
business. We continue to have exposure to property risks within our insurance operations.
For our professional liability and general liability lines of business within our insurance operations, we typically purchase excess of loss coverage. On
product lines with property exposures, we purchase both excess of loss and proportionate coverages to reduce our exposure to large losses,
including catastrophes. The structure of our reinsurance purchases may vary from year to year depending on the availability and cost of reinsurance,
as determined by current market conditions. In such instances, we may in turn modify our gross premium writings in order to to manage our overall
net loss exposures. Net retention of gross premium volume in our underwriting segments was 83% in 2022.
Reinsurance and retrocessional treaties are generally purchased on an annual basis and are subject to renegotiation at renewal. In most
circumstances, the reinsurer remains responsible for all business produced before termination. Treaties typically contain provisions concerning
ceding commissions, required reports to reinsurers, responsibility for taxes, arbitration in the event of a dispute and provisions that allow us to
demand that a reinsurer post letters of credit or assets as security if a reinsurer becomes an unauthorized reinsurer under applicable regulations or if
its rating falls below an acceptable level.
Our ceded reinsurance and retrocessional contracts do not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we
will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. We attempt to
minimize credit exposure to reinsurers through adherence to internal ceded reinsurance guidelines. We manage our exposures so that no unsecured
exposure to any one reinsurer is material to our ongoing business.

When appropriate, we pursue reinsurance commutations that involve the termination of ceded reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance contracts.
Our commutation strategy related to ceded reinsurance and retrocessional contracts is to reduce credit exposure and eliminate administrative
expenses associated with the run-off of ceded reinsurance placed with certain reinsurers.
See note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk for additional information about our ceded reinsurance programs and exposures.
Competition and Underwriting Philosophy
We compete with numerous domestic and international insurance companies and reinsurers, Lloyd's syndicates, risk retention groups, insurance
buying groups, risk securitization programs, alternative capital sources, such as that provided through ILS, and alternative self-insurance
mechanisms. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets, particularly
companies with new or "disruptive" technologies or business models. Competition may take the form of lower prices, broader coverages, greater
product flexibility, enhanced digital capabilities for distribution of insurance products, higher coverage limits, higher quality services or higher ratings
by independent rating agencies. In all of our markets, we compete on the basis of overall financial strength, ratings assigned by independent rating
agencies, development of specialty products to satisfy well-defined market needs and by maintaining relationships with agents, brokers and insureds
who rely on our expertise. This expertise is our principal means of competing. We offer a diverse portfolio of products, each with its own distinct
competitive environment, which requires us to be responsive to changes in market conditions for individual product lines. With each of our products,
we seek to write business that produces consistent underwriting profits by competing with innovative ideas, appropriate pricing, expense control and
quality service to policyholders, agents and brokers. We also leverage our underwriting capacity and expertise through relationships with start-ups
and digital distribution partners through which we can develop ideas that leverage emerging technologies and modern customer acquisition
strategies to create the service and experience that consumers have grown to expect and demand.
Few barriers exist to prevent insurers and reinsurers from entering our markets within the property and casualty industry. Market conditions, risk
tolerance and capital capacity influence the degree of competition at any point in time. During periods of excess underwriting capacity, as defined by
availability of capital, competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers. During periods of reduced
underwriting capacity, pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers. Historically, the performance of the property
and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity,
followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. At any given time, our portfolio of insurance products could be
experiencing varying combinations of these characteristics. This cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the specialty insurance and
reinsurance markets in which we compete than the standard insurance market.
Following several years of price decreases and the high level of natural catastrophes that occurred in 2017, we began seeing more favorable rates in
2018, particularly on our catastrophe-exposed and loss-affected business. Since 2018, we have continued to see rate strengthening across most
product lines following the continued high level of natural catastrophes and significant losses attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general
market conditions. However, we began to see rate increases moderate on many of our product lines in 2022. In some product lines, such as directors
and officers, we even began to see single digit rate decreases in the latter part of 2022. The overall strengthening of rates in recent years has been
most prominent within our professional liability and general liability product lines, reflecting the impacts of both economic and social inflation on loss
costs. Recent increases in economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle
claims on these longer-tail product lines. These factors, as well as the impacts of the low interest rate environment on interest income in recent
years, have contributed to the strong rate environment. The primary exception to the favorable rate environment is workers' compensation, where
we continue to see low single digit rate decreases given generally favorable loss experience in recent years.
By focusing on market niches where we have underwriting expertise, and leveraging capabilities offered through our multiple insurance platforms, we
seek to earn consistent underwriting profits, which are a key component of our strategy. The property and casualty insurance industry commonly
defines underwriting profit or loss as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance
expenses. We believe that the ability to achieve consistent underwriting profits demonstrates knowledge and expertise, commitment to superior
customer service and the ability to manage insurance risk. We use underwriting profit or loss as a basis for evaluating our underwriting performance.
The combined ratio is a measure of underwriting performance and represents the relationship of incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and
underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses to earned premiums. A combined ratio less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while a
combined ratio greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss. In 2022, our
10K - 8

combined ratio was 92%. See Item 7 Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of our
underwriting results.
We routinely review the pricing of our major product lines. When we believe the prevailing market price will not support our underwriting profit
targets, the business is not written. As a result of our underwriting discipline, gross premium volume may vary when we alter our product offerings to
maintain or improve underwriting profitability.
Over the past few years, we have increased our focus on growing our most profitable lines of business and have discontinued certain lines or
programs that have not performed consistent with our expectations. This is particularly true within our Reinsurance segment, where in 2021, we
discontinued writing property reinsurance business, including catastrophe-exposed property business, on a risk-bearing basis, and in 2022, we
discontinued writing property retrocessional reinsurance business. In more limited instances, we have taken similar actions within our Insurance
segment. We saw the benefit of these changes in our underwriting results in 2022, which reflected a lower impact from Hurricane Ian than we would
have expected absent these changes.
Underwriting Segments
We monitor and assess the performance of our ongoing underwriting operations on a global basis in the following two segments: Insurance and
Reinsurance. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional segment reporting disclosures.
Insurance Segment
Our Insurance segment reported gross premium volume of $8.6 billion, earned premiums of $6.5 billion and an underwriting profit of $549.9 million in
2022. The following chart presents the composition of our Insurance segment by division based on 2022 gross premium volume.
The Markel Specialty division writes business for insureds from individuals and small businesses to Fortune 1000 companies in the U.S., Bermuda, the
U.K. and the E.U. The Markel Specialty division is a unified platform that provides easy access to our diverse portfolio of products and capabilities.
The Markel International division writes business worldwide from our London and Munich-based platforms, which include branch offices around the
world. The State National division writes collateral protection insurance in the U.S., which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as
collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies through its lender services product line on both an admitted and
non-admitted basis.

</Chart Analysis>
The following chart displays the types of products written in our Insurance segment based on 2022 gross premium volume.
Our professional liability product lines provide insurance solutions for small, middle market and risk management accounts with coverage that is
tailored to their exposures and needs. Professional liability coverages include errors and omissions, directors and officers, cyber, employment
practices liability, professional indemnity, transaction liability, intellectual property and union liability. Errors and omissions coverage provides
solutions for specialized professions including lawyers, accountants, agents and brokers, service technicians and consultants, as well as other less-
specialized professionals. Directors and officers coverage is provided for publicly-traded, private and non-profit companies, including financial
institutions and Fortune 1000 companies. Cyber products provide coverage for, among other things, data breach and privacy liability, data breach
loss to insureds and electronic media coverage. We also offer claims-made professional liability coverage for individual healthcare providers, such as
therapists, pharmacists, physician assistants and nurse anesthetists, and coverages for medical facilities and other allied healthcare risks, such as
clinics, laboratories, pharmacies and senior living facilities.
General liability product offerings include a variety of primary and excess liability coverages. We focus on businesses in the construction, life
sciences, energy, medical, healthcare, pharmaceutical, professional services, social welfare, recreational, transportation, heavy industrial and
hospitality industries. Specific products include primary general liability, excess and umbrella products, products liability products, environmental
liability products and casualty facultative reinsurance written for individual casualty risks.
Personal lines products provide first and third-party coverages in the U.S. for classic cars, motorcycles and a variety of personal watercraft, including
vintage boats, high-performance boats and yachts and recreational vehicles, such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and ATVs. Based on the seasonal
nature of much of our personal lines business, we generally will experience higher claims activity during the second and third quarters of the year.
Additionally, property coverages are offered for mobile homes, dwellings and homeowners that do not qualify for standard homeowner's coverage, as
well as personal umbrella coverage.
Marine and energy products include a portfolio of coverages for cargo, energy, hull, liability, war and terrorism risks worldwide. The cargo product
line is an international transit-based book providing coverage for many types of cargo. Energy coverage includes all aspects of oil, gas and renewable
energy activities. Hull coverages consist of coverage for physical damage to ocean-going tonnage, yachts and mortgagees' interests. Liability
coverage provides for a broad range of energy liabilities, as well as traditional marine exposures including charterers, terminal operators and ship
repairers. War coverage includes protections for the hulls of ships, and other related interests, against war and associated perils. Terrorism coverage
provides for property damage and business interruption related to political and civil violence including war and civil war.
Property coverages consist principally of fire, allied lines (including windstorm, hail and water damage) and other specialized property coverages,
including catastrophe-exposed property risks such as earthquake and wind on both a primary and excess basis. Catastrophe-exposed property risks
are typically lower frequency and higher severity in nature than more standard property risks. Our property coverages are exposed to windstorm
losses that, based on the seasonal nature of those events, are more likely to occur in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Our property risks
range from small, single-location accounts

to large, multi-state, multi-location, multi-national accounts on a worldwide basis. Other types of property products include inland marine products,
railroad-related products and specie coverage for fine art on exhibition and in private collections.
Specialty programs business is offered in the U.S. on a standalone or package basis and generally targets specialized commercial markets and
various customer groups, such as amateur sports and fitness clubs. Certain specialty programs written in this segment use managing general agents
to offer single source admitted and non-admitted programs for a specific industry, class or line of business, including first and third-party coverages
such as packaged policies for providers of leisure and recreational activities.
Workers' compensation products are offered in the U.S. and provide wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of
employment and target main-street, service and artisan contractor businesses, retail stores and restaurants.
Credit and surety products consist primarily of trade credit and prepayment coverage and a range of bonds and guarantees that support contractual
obligations, as well as other coverages for specific credit risks, markets and contingencies. Key risks covered include those of counterparty insolvency
and defaults by government-owned entities. The key coverages under surety products include contractual performance and payment risks,
commercial license and permit obligations and obligations related to judicial proceedings such as court and fiduciary bonds.
Other product lines within the Insurance segment include auto and collateral protection insurance.
Reinsurance Segment
Our Reinsurance segment product offerings are underwritten primarily by our Global Reinsurance division, which operates from platforms in the U.S.,
Bermuda and the U.K. We write quota share and excess of loss reinsurance on a local, national and global basis. Our Reinsurance segment reported
gross premium volume of $1.2 billion, earned premiums of $1.1 billion and an underwriting profit of $83.9 million in 2022. The following chart
displays the types of products written in our Reinsurance segment based on 2022 gross premium volume.
Professional liability reinsurance primarily consists of the following:
• Transaction liability, which provides representation, warranty and indemnity coverage for mergers and acquisitions, including coverage for
tax and contingent liability;
• Directors and officers liability for publicly-traded, private and non-profit companies;
• Cyber and technology errors and omissions covering both first and third-party exposures;
• Errors and omissions for lawyers, accountants, agents and brokers, services technicians and consultants; and
• Healthcare liability for physicians, hospitals, long-term care and other medical facilities.
General liability reinsurance primarily consists of umbrella and excess casualty products, as well as environmental liability products covering pollution
legal liability and contractors' pollution exposures.

</Chart Analysis>
Our specialty treaty reinsurance products are also written on a quota share and excess of loss basis across a wide range of specialty product lines,
primarily consisting of the following:
• Credit and surety products, including structured and whole turnover credit, political risk and contract and commercial surety reinsurance
programs covering worldwide exposures;
• Workers' compensation and accident and health covering both standard and catastrophe-exposed business in the U.S. and worldwide;
• Marine and energy products, both offshore and onshore marine, energy and renewable energy risks on a worldwide basis, including hull,
cargo and liability;
• Public entity reinsurance products offering casualty coverage for municipalities, schools, special districts, public housing authorities and
public entity affiliated non-profits;
• Mortgage default insurance offering coverage for private mortgage insurers predominantly located in the U.S. and Australia;
• Aviation and space coverage, including major risk, general aviation, satellite launch and orbit;
• Agriculture reinsurance covering multi-peril crop insurance, hail and related exposures for risks located in the U.S. and Canada; and
• Discrete political violence and national terror pools in select jurisdictions globally.
Previously, we also wrote property reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance business. We discontinued writing these lines effective January 1, 2021
and 2022, respectively, and effective January 1, 2022, we were off-risk for substantially all property loss exposures, including catastrophe exposures,
previously written within our Reinsurance segment. Any such business is now written on behalf of our Nephila ILS operations to the extent it matches
the risk-profile of our third-party ILS investors, who will ultimately assume the risk.
Insurance-Linked Securities
Our insurance-linked securities operations are primarily comprised of our Nephila operations and are not included in a reportable segment. Nephila
Holdings Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Nephila) provides investment and insurance management services through which we offer alternative
capital to the reinsurance market while providing investors with investment strategies that typically are uncorrelated with traditional asset classes.
We receive management fees for investment and insurance management services provided through these operations primarily based on the net
asset value of the accounts managed, and for certain funds, incentive fees based on their annual performance. Through 2022, we also provided risk
origination services for our fund management operations, as well as for third parties, through our Velocity and Volante managing general agent
companies and received commissions based on the direct written premiums of the insurance contracts placed. Total revenues from our insurance-
linked securities operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $338.3 million, which included $225.8 million of gains from the sales of our
managing general agent operations.
Our fund management operations provide insurance and investment management services for a broad range of investment products for insurance
and reinsurance companies, government entities, banks, hedge funds, pension funds and institutional investors, including insurance-linked securities,
catastrophe bonds, insurance swaps and weather derivatives. Nephila serves as the investment manager to several Bermuda based private funds
(the Nephila Funds). To provide access for the Nephila Funds to a variety of insurance-linked securities in the property catastrophe, climate and
specialty markets, Nephila acts as an insurance manager to certain Bermuda Class 3 and 3A reinsurance companies, Lloyd's Syndicate 2357 and
Lloyd's Syndicate 2358 (collectively, the Nephila Reinsurers). The results of the Nephila Reinsurers are attributed to the Nephila Funds primarily
through derivative transactions between these entities. Neither the Nephila Funds nor the Nephila Reinsurers are subsidiaries of Markel Corporation,
and as such, these entities are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
The Nephila Reinsurers subscribe to various reinsurance contracts based on their investors' risk profiles, including property and specialty reinsurance
business fronted through our underwriting and program services platforms. We write this business on behalf of our Nephila ILS operations to the
extent it fits Nephila investors' risk profile and cede substantially all of the risk to Nephila Reinsurers. See note 18 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included under Item 8 for further details regarding transactions with entities managed through our Nephila operations.
Since our acquisition of Nephila in 2018, we experienced significant growth in the Velocity and Volante managing general agent operations. We
realized the value created since 2018 through the sale of Velocity in February 2022 and Volante in October 2022. See Note 3 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional details regarding these transactions.
10K - 12

Following the sales of our Velocity and Volante managing general agent operations, our Nephila ILS operations are solely comprised of our fund
management operations. Since acquiring Nephila in 2018, investment performance in the broader ILS market has been adversely impacted by
consecutive years of elevated catastrophe losses, most recently with Hurricane Ian in 2022. These events, as well as recent volatility in the capital
markets, have impacted investor decisions around allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn has impacted our capital raises and redemptions within
the funds we manage. As of December 31, 2022, Nephila's net assets under management were $7.2 billion.
Our insurance-linked securities operations also include our run-off Markel CATCo operations, the results of which are reported separately from our
ongoing insurance-linked securities operations. Our Markel CATCo operations are conducted through Markel CATCo Investment Management Ltd.
(MCIM), an ILS investment fund manager headquartered in Bermuda. MCIM serves as the insurance manager for Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (Markel CATCo
Re), a Bermuda Class 3 reinsurance company, and as the investment manager for Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd., a Bermuda exempted mutual
fund company comprised of multiple segregated accounts (Markel CATCo Funds). In July 2019, these operations were placed into run-off. In March
2022, we completed a buy-out transaction that provided for an accelerated return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds.
Following the completion of the buy-out transaction, we consolidate Markel CATCo Re as its primary beneficiary. Results attributable to the run-off of
Markel CATCo Re are included with our other Markel CATCo operations within services and other expenses, and for the year ended December 31,
2022, these results were entirely attributable to noncontrolling interest holders in Markel CATCo Re. In connection with the buy-out transaction, we
entered into a tail risk cover with Markel CATCo Re through which we have uncollateralized exposure to adverse development on loss reserves held
by Markel CATCo Re for loss exposures in excess of limits that we believe are unlikely to be exceeded. For further details regarding our Markel CATCo
operations and the consolidation of Markel CATCo Re, see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 and for
further details regarding the buy-out transaction, see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8.
Program Services and Other Fronting
Our program services business generates fee income in the form of ceding fees in exchange for fronting insurance business to other insurance
carriers (capacity providers). In general, fronting refers to business in which we write insurance on behalf of a general agent or capacity provider and
then cede all, or substantially all, of the risk under these policies to the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees. The results of our program
services operations are not included in a reportable segment.
Our program services business, which is provided through our State National division, offers issuing carrier capacity to both specialty managing
general agents and other producers who sell, control and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume
reinsurance risk, including the Nephila Reinsurers. These reinsurers are domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors that want to
access specific lines of U.S. property and casualty insurance business but may not have the required licenses and filings to do so.
Through our program services business, we write a wide variety of insurance products, principally including general liability, commercial liability,
commercial multi-peril, property and workers' compensation. Program services business written through our State National division is separately
managed from our underwriting divisions, which write similar products, in order to protect our program services customers.
The following table summarizes the subsidiaries through which our program services business is written.
Legal Entity Abbreviation State of Domicile
City National Insurance Company CNIC Texas
Independent Specialty Insurance Company ISIC Delaware
National Specialty Insurance Company NSIC Texas
Pinnacle National Insurance Company PNIC Texas

These subsidiaries are authorized or licensed to write property and casualty insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Many of our
programs are arranged with the assistance of brokers that are seeking to provide customized insurance solutions for specialty insurance business
that requires a carrier rated "A" by A.M. Best Company (Best). Our specialized
10K - 13

business model relies on third-party producers or capacity providers to provide the infrastructure associated with providing policy administration,
claims handling, cash handling, underwriting, or other traditional insurance company services. We compete primarily on the basis of price, customer
service, geographic coverage, financial strength ratings, licenses, reputation, business model and experience.
Total revenues attributed to our program services business for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $133.3 million. Our program services
business generated $2.8 billion of gross written premium volume for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In our program services business, we generally enter into quota share reinsurance agreements whereby we cede to the capacity providers
substantially all of our gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of us by the producer. The capacity providers are generally entitled to
100% of the net premiums received on policies reinsured, less the ceding fee to us, the commission paid to the producer and premium taxes on the
policies. In connection with writing this business, we also enter into agency agreements with both the producer and the capacity providers whereby
the producer and capacity providers are generally required to deal directly with each other to develop business structures and terms to implement
and maintain the ongoing contractual relationship. In a number of cases, the producer and capacity providers for a program are part of the same
organization or are otherwise affiliated. As a result of our contract design, substantially all of the underwriting risk and operational risk inherent in the
arrangement is borne by the capacity providers. The capacity providers assume and are liable for substantially all losses incurred in connection with
the risks under the reinsurance agreement, including judgments and settlements. Our contracts with capacity providers do not legally discharge us
from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and we will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if a capacity provider fails
to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. As a result, we remain exposed to the credit risk of capacity providers, or the risk that one
of our capacity providers becomes insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims. We mitigate this credit risk generally by
either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized capacity providers or requiring that the capacity provider post substantial collateral to secure
the reinsured risks, which, in some instances, exceeds the related reinsurance recoverable.
In certain instances, we also leverage the strength of our underwriting platform to write business on behalf of our ILS operations, in exchange for
ceding fees, to support their business plans and assist in meeting their desired return objectives. This fronting business is conducted separately from
our program services business and consists of catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance business and specialty reinsurance business.
Although we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our program services business and ILS fronting arrangements, we have certain
programs that contain limits on our reinsurers' obligations to us that expose us to underwriting risk, including loss ratio caps, aggregate reinsurance
limits or exclusion of the credit risk of producers. Under certain programs, including programs and contracts with Nephila Reinsurers, we also bear
underwriting risk for annual aggregate agreement year losses in excess of a limit that we believe is unlikely to be exceeded. See note 18 of the notes
to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details regarding our programs with Nephila Reinsurers.
Ratings
Financial stability and strength are important purchase considerations of policyholders, cedents and insurance agents and brokers. Because an
insurance premium paid today purchases coverage for losses that might not be paid for many years, the financial viability of the insurer is of critical
concern. Various independent rating agencies provide information and assign ratings to assist buyers in their search for financially sound insurers.
Rating agencies periodically re-evaluate assigned ratings based upon changes in the insurer's operating results, financial condition or other
significant factors influencing the insurer's business. Changes in assigned ratings could have an adverse impact on an insurer's ability to write new
business.
Rating agencies assign financial strength ratings (FSRs) to property and casualty insurance companies based on quantitative criteria such as
profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as qualitative assessments such as the spread of risk, the adequacy and soundness of ceded reinsurance,
the quality and estimated market value of assets, the adequacy of loss reserves and surplus and the competence, experience and integrity of
management.
Seventeen of our eighteen insurance subsidiaries are rated by Best. All seventeen of our insurance subsidiaries rated by Best have been assigned an
FSR of "A" (excellent). Our Lloyd's syndicate is part of a group rating for the Lloyd's overall market, which has been assigned an FSR of "A" (excellent)
by Best.
10K - 14

Nine of our eighteen insurance subsidiaries are rated by Standard & Poor's (S&P). All nine of our insurance subsidiaries rated by S&P have been
assigned an FSR of "A" (strong). Our Lloyd's syndicate is part of a group rating for the Lloyd's overall market, which has been assigned an FSR of "A+"
(strong) by S&P.
Five of our eighteen insurance subsidiaries are rated by Moody's Corporation (Moody's). All five insurance subsidiaries rated by Moody's have been
assigned an FSR of "A2" (good).
Investments
Our business strategy recognizes the importance of both consistent underwriting and operating profits and superior investment returns to build
shareholder value. The majority of our investable assets come from premiums paid by policyholders. We rely on sound underwriting practices to
produce investable funds. Policyholder funds are invested predominantly in high-quality government and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed
securities that generally match the duration and currency of our loss reserves. We typically hold these fixed maturity investments until maturity. As a
result, unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are generally expected to reverse as the securities mature. Premiums collected
through our underwriting operations may also be held as short-term investments or cash and cash equivalents to provide short-term liquidity for
projected claims payments, reinsurance costs and operating expenses. The balance of our investable assets, comprised of shareholder funds, is
available to be invested in equity securities, which over the long run, have produced higher returns relative to fixed maturity and short-term
investments. When purchasing equity securities, we seek to invest in profitable companies, with honest and talented management, that exhibit
reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, at reasonable prices. We intend to hold these equity investments over the long-term. Substantially
all of our investment portfolio is managed by company employees.
Invested assets, comprised of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and
cash equivalents, were $27.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The following chart displays the composition of our invested assets as of December 31,
2022.
We measure our investment performance by analyzing net investment income earned on our investment portfolio, as well as through net investment
gains, which includes unrealized gains on our equity portfolio, and the change in net unrealized investment gains on available-for-sale investments.
Our performance measures also include investment yield and taxable equivalent total investment return, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We
focus on long-term investment performance, understanding that the level of investment gains or losses and unrealized gains or losses may vary from
one period to the next.
Markel Ventures
Through our wholly owned subsidiary Markel Ventures, Inc. (Markel Ventures), we own controlling interests in various high-quality businesses that
operate in a variety of different industries with the shared goal of positively contributing to the long-term financial performance of Markel
Corporation. Management teams for each business operate autonomously and are responsible for developing strategic initiatives, managing day-to-
day operations and making investment and capital allocation decisions for their respective companies.

Our corporate management team is responsible for decisions regarding allocation of capital for acquisitions and new investments. Our strategy in
making these acquisitions is similar to our strategy for purchasing equity securities. We seek to invest in profitable companies, with honest and
talented management, that exhibit reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, at reasonable prices. We intend to own the businesses acquired
for a long period of time. Our chief operating decision maker allocates resources to and assesses the performance of these various businesses in the
aggregate as the Markel Ventures segment. See note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional
segment reporting disclosures.
The Markel Ventures segment includes a diverse portfolio of specialized businesses from different industries that offer various types of products and
services to businesses and consumers across many markets. All of our businesses in this segment are headquartered in the U.S., with subsidiaries of
certain businesses located outside of the U.S. During the last three years, our Markel Ventures operations have expanded through acquisitions of
majority interests in various businesses, including Metromont LLC and Buckner HeavyLift Cranes in 2021 and Lansing Building Products, LLC in 2020.
See note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for additional details related to these acquisitions. This follows
acquisitions of VSC Fire & Security, Inc. in 2019 and Brahmin Leather Works LLC in 2018. We continue to look for acquisition opportunities that align
with our investment criteria and strategic objectives around diversification and specialization.
In 2022, our Markel Ventures operations reported revenues of $4.8 billion, operating income of $325.2 million, net income to shareholders of $192.6
million and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $506.3 million. We use Markel Ventures EBITDA, which
is a non-GAAP financial measure, as an operating performance measure in conjunction with revenues, operating income and net income. See "Markel
Ventures" under Item 7 Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our Markel
Ventures results, including EBITDA.
The following chart displays the types of businesses within our Markel Ventures segment based on 2022 operating revenues. Our senior management
team does not manage the Markel Ventures portfolio of businesses at this level of aggregation due to the distinct characteristics of each business
and the autonomy with which local management operates each business.
Products and services offered through these types of businesses include:
• Construction Services - Companies that provide distribution services for exterior building products, crane rental services and fire protection
and life safety services to other businesses in the U.S. construction market;
• Consumer and Building Products - Companies that produce or build ornamental plants, precast concrete solutions, residential homes, luxury
handbags and architectural products, which are primarily sold to consumers in the U.S. retail and housing markets;
• Transportation-Related Products - Companies that manufacture and sell over-the-road car haulers, laminated oak and composite wood
flooring and tube and tank trailers primarily used in the U.S. trucking industry;
• Consulting Services - Companies that provide management and technology consulting and retail intelligence services to other businesses
primarily in the U.S. market;

Markel Ventures businesses encounter a variety of competitors that vary by industry, end market and geographic area. Each Markel Ventures
business has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of its respective end markets and geographic areas. Many of the
businesses in this segment experience revenue fluctuations over time due to the cyclical nature of supply and demand in their particular industry. For
example, the construction industry is cyclical based on certain larger economic trends and factors, including the inflationary and interest rate
environment and, for some businesses, the level of government investment. Additionally, many of our businesses experience fluctuation in demand
throughout the year based on the seasonality of the products they sell or services they provide. For example, the demand for ornamental plants is
particularly high during the spring and summer seasons as compared to the rest of the year. Businesses in this segment are reliant on inputs, such as
raw materials and labor, to manufacture products and deliver services, and the operating results of these businesses could be impacted by the ability
or inability to source these inputs and obtain price increases from customers in response to increases in the price of these inputs, including the cost
of shipping. For example, shipping costs at some of our businesses increased significantly in 2021 and 2022, which has resulted in smaller margins as
we have been unable to pass all of these cost increases through to our customers in certain instances. Management teams for each of our businesses
proactively manage the risks and challenges posed by cyclicality, seasonality and inflation, among other things, in a variety of ways as appropriate
and as needed for their business.
Regulatory Environment
We are subject to extensive state, federal and international regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations vary
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, as a company with publicly-traded securities, we are also subject to certain legal and regulatory
requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
and the New York Stock Exchange relating to reporting and disclosure, accounting and financial reporting, corporate governance and other matters.
The following is a summary of significant regulations that apply to our businesses, but it is not intended to be a comprehensive review of every
regulation to which we are subject. For information regarding certain risks associated with regulations applicable to us, see Item 1A Risk Factors.
U.S. Insurance Regulation
State Regulation
Overview. Our U.S. insurance company subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions
in which they do business. In the U.S., authority for the regulation, supervision and administration of the business of insurance in each state is
generally delegated to a state insurance commissioner who oversees a regulatory body responsible for the supervision of the business of insurance.
State regulatory authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers relating to: solvency standards; corporate conduct; market
conduct activities; regulating unfair trade and claims practices; licensing of insurers; licensing and appointment of agents; approval of forms and
policies used; the nature of, and limitations on, insurers' investments; the form and content of annual statements and other reports on the financial
condition of insurers; and establishment of loss reserves. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and
independent agents. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), comprised of the insurance commissioners of each U.S.
jurisdiction, develops or amends model statutes and regulations that, in turn, most states adopt.
Group Supervision - Global Supervisory College; Global Common Framework. Regulators within and outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the
regulation of multinational insurers by conducting a supervisory college. A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional
authority over an insurance holding company's worldwide insurance subsidiaries. The supervisory college meets with executive management to
evaluate the insurance group on both a group-wide and legal-entity basis, particularly with respect to its financial data, business strategies,
enterprise risk management and corporate governance. The Illinois Department of Insurance is our lead insurance regulator for purposes of
conducting our supervisory college.
In 2020, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors adopted its Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active
Insurance Groups (ComFrame). ComFrame establishes a comprehensive framework for supervisors to
10K - 17

address group-wide activities and risks of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs) and lays the groundwork for better supervisory cooperation
and coordination. ComFrame requires the designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each IAIG and imposes a group capital requirement
that will be applied to an IAIG in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements imposed by state and international insurance regulators. In
response to ComFrame, the NAIC revised the model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act to allow state insurance regulators in the
U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S. based IAIGs.
Holding Company Statutes. In addition to regulatory supervision of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing
insurance holding company systems. Typically, those statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance
commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition, dividend payments and other material
transactions with affiliates, and general business operations. These statutes also require approval of changes in control of an insurer or an insurance
holding company. Generally, "control" for these purposes is defined as ownership or voting power of 10% or more of a company's voting shares.
Additional requirements include group-level reporting, submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance company's ultimate
controlling person and providing information regarding an insurer's non-insurer affiliates.
Risk Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC uses a risk based capital (RBC) formula that is designed to measure the capital of an insurer taking into
account the company's investments and products. RBC requirements provide a formula which, for property and casualty insurance companies,
establishes capital thresholds for four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk.
Financial Exams. State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial
examinations of insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for permissible types and amounts of investments
and require minimum capital and surplus levels. These statutory capital and surplus requirements include RBC rules promulgated by the NAIC.
Statutory Accounting Principles. Each of our U.S. insurance company subsidiaries is required to file detailed quarterly and annual reports, including
financial statements, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules, with regulatory officials in the jurisdictions in which they conduct
business. The quarterly and annual financial reports filed with the states utilize statutory accounting principles (SAP) that are different from U.S.
GAAP. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with monitoring the solvency of insurance companies to assure an insurer's
ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment and Enterprise Risk Management. We must submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report
(ORSA) annually to our lead insurance regulator. The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an
insurer's current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. In addition, we must file an annual enterprise risk
report with our lead insurance regulator. The report must identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose
enterprise risk to the U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
Rates and Form Filings. The policy forms and various premium rates of our U.S. admitted insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in every
state in which they conduct business. In many states, rates and policy forms must be filed with the applicable insurance regulator prior to their use,
and in some states, rates and forms must be affirmatively approved by the applicable insurance regulator prior to use.
Dividends. The laws of the domicile states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries govern the amount of dividends that may be paid to our holding
company, Markel Corporation. Generally, statutes in the domicile states of our insurance subsidiaries require prior approval for payment of
extraordinary, as opposed to ordinary, dividends. See note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8.
Market Conduct. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of
insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, data security, compliance of underwriting services to policyholders,
confirmation of licensing and appointment of producers, claims management, anti-fraud controls and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities
generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
Investment Regulation. Investments by our U.S. insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations that prescribe the kind,
quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in
10K - 18

federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other
investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications.
Federal Regulation
The U.S. federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, two federal
government bodies, the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), each created under The Dodd Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may impact the regulation of insurance. Although the FIO is prohibited from directly regulating the
business of insurance, it has authority to represent the U.S. in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of
state insurance laws. The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in
the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure. We have not been so designated. The U.S. federal laws that most affect our day-to-day
insurance operations are: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair Credit Reporting Act; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
as amended; the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance
Reform Act of 2010, as amended; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
International Insurance Regulation
Overview. Our international insurance operations are subject to regulation and supervision in various jurisdictions. These regulations, which vary
depending on the jurisdiction, include, among others, solvency and market conduct regulations; anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and anti-
terrorism financing guidelines, laws and regulations; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff, trade and sanctions laws and regulations; and corporate,
competition, employment, intellectual property and investment laws and regulations. Outside of the U.S., we have insurance operations domiciled in
the U.K., Europe and Bermuda, which are subject to regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, we conduct business in Canada, Asia and the Middle
East, where our businesses also are supervised by local regulatory authorities.
U.K. and European Regulation. We are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority in respect of our
U.K. insurance businesses. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, better known by its abbreviation BaFin, in
respect of our German insurance carrier.
Our U.K. and German insurance businesses are subject to both the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Solvency II Directive
(Solvency II).
GDPR requires businesses operating in the E.U., and businesses transacting with E.U. citizens, to comply with conditions for processing personal data.
Following the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., GDPR was transposed into U.K. law. The E.U. has granted adequacy status to the U.K.'s data protection laws,
valid until June 2025 with the possibility of renewal, meaning that they are deemed essentially equivalent to E.U. data protection laws.
Solvency II requires our U.K. and German businesses to maintain certain capital standards and publish risk-related information in the form of a
Solvency and Financial Condition Report. Following the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., Solvency II also was transposed into U.K. law as retained law. The
U.K. government, under the Financial Services and Markets Bill, plans to repeal certain retained law with an approach to regulation designed for the
U.K., including reforms to Solvency II.
Bermuda Regulation. The insurance industry in Bermuda is regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Under the Bermuda Insurance Act
1978, and related regulations and standards of the BMA, each Bermuda insurance company is subject to, among other things: licensing, capital,
surplus and liquidity requirements; solvency standards; restrictions on dividends and distributions; and periodic examinations of the company and its
financial condition. In addition, each insurance company must obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares and maintain a principal
office and appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. The BMA also requires that each insurance company contract for local
services, such as corporate secretary, insurance manager and registered representative services, at market rates.
ILS Regulation
Our insurance-linked securities operations are subject to regulation and supervision by various regulatory authorities, both in the U.S. and
internationally. Certain of our ILS subsidiaries are organized and regulated as follows:
• registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,
10K - 19

• registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor under the
Commodity Exchange Act, as amended,
• registered with the BMA as an insurance manager under the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, and/or
• registered with the BMA as an investment manager under the Bermuda Investments Business Act 2003.
Certain other ILS subsidiaries serve as the investment manager to one or more private funds that are registered with the BMA under the Investment
Funds Act 2006, as amended, or the Segregated Accounts Companies Act 2000, as amended. In addition, these operations include business
relationships with certain U.S., U.K. and Bermuda insurance companies that are subject to U.S. and international insurance regulation as previously
described in this "Regulatory Environment" section.
As a result, subsidiaries involved in our ILS operations are subject to regulations that may impose substantive and material restrictions and
requirements on their operations, including, among other things: a broader fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their clients; disclosure of
information about our businesses and conflicts of interests to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive
books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge, including performance fees; restrictions on solicitation arrangements;
requirements regarding engaging in transactions with clients; maintenance of an effective compliance program; and other restrictions and
requirements applicable to custody of client assets, client privacy, advertising, pay-to-play prohibitions and cybersecurity; as well as possible
sanctions, disciplinary actions or other penalties for non-compliance.
Markel Ventures Regulation
Our Markel Ventures businesses are subject to a wide variety of U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as international laws and
regulations applicable to their international operations. Specifically, the most significant of these laws and regulations cover the following areas:
safety, health, employment, the environment, transportation, U.S. and international trade, anti-corruption, data privacy and security and government
contracts.
Human Capital
Our culture is our greatest asset and is defined by the Markel Style. Written in 1986, in preparation for our initial public offering, the Markel Style
memorialized how we seek to operate our businesses and treat one another. It continues to provide our guiding principles across our diverse group of
businesses. Key within the Markel Style is the encouragement to look for a better way to do things, to challenge management. We also seek
spontaneity and flexibility and a respect for authority, but disdain for bureaucracy. Our diverse financial holding company is managed in a way to
accomplish these principles. Each of our businesses operates with a high degree of autonomy so long as they operate within the principles of the
Markel Style. This allows our managers to make decisions that are best for their employees and customers, as well as our shareholders. We believe
this high degree of empowerment leads to the satisfaction that comes from being trusted in the responsibilities one has been given.
Further outlined in the Markel Style is our creed of honesty and fairness in all our dealings; holding the individual's right to self-determination in the
highest light; putting aside individual concerns in the spirit of teamwork; and providing an atmosphere in which people can reach their full potential.
We greatly value our employees, encourage their career development and reward their pursuit of excellence, while also celebrating a diverse
workforce.
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 20,900 employees, of whom approximately 5,000 were employed within our insurance operations and
approximately 15,900 were employed within our Markel Ventures operations.
Insurance
Our principal business markets and underwrites specialty insurance products and within that business exists a well-developed process to ensure
effective performance management, including an embedded annual and mid-year review process that enables goal setting, development planning
and performance assessment. Within our insurance operations, we also have undertaken significant work over recent years to establish global
leadership development programs for different levels of leadership at Markel, including partnering with various renowned business schools to create
leading-edge curriculum in this area.
With the Markel Style as our foundation, we have identified five pillars of focus that relate to today's challenges and opportunities—diversity and
inclusion, community, innovation, well-being, and recognition. This program is both company and employee led—collectively, we want to bring the
values of the Markel Style to life with our actions, not just our words. Our intent is to create an environment where employees are able to
authentically bring their true selves to work, a place where
10K - 20

all ideas are heard and diverse perspectives are valued, a culture that prioritizes innovation, the ability to make a difference for our local
communities and the wider world, and a foundation for holding ourselves accountable for our own well-being and of those around us.
Employee health and overall well-being is a key priority, and we provide a range of employee and eligible partner plans and programs, including
health and voluntary benefits. These offerings include a variety of financial protection programs to help our employees meet their unique investment
and savings needs including life insurance, retirement savings with company contributions in most situations and an employee stock purchase plan.
Comprehensive employee assistance programs are available in all of our major markets along with other well-being and fitness resources.
We rely on our employees' ideas and input to help make Markel a great place to work. For example, senior leadership conducts regular employee
communication meetings, inclusive of question and answer sessions, across our insurance operations providing opportunities for employees to share
their ideas on how we can improve employee engagement. In addition, every two years we conduct a major, global employee engagement survey,
which in early 2022 garnered 88% participation, and which enables us to identify, focus on and track progress against key engagement drivers and
external norms for high performing companies. This survey has generated additional ideas for employee engagement; and we have made meaningful
changes and improvements in our human capital practices based on this feedback.
We are committed to embracing all aspects of diversity, including diversity of perspective, which we believe is crucial to sustainable success. Markel
accordingly supports and encourages focused efforts to continue to build the diversity of our employee population and the inclusiveness of our
culture. Our diversity and inclusion efforts seek to cultivate an inclusive environment in which every employee feels valued, respected and accepted.
We believe this environment helps us increase creativity and innovation, foster business connections, serve our customers and maintain our market
leadership.
Within our insurance business, our global Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Steering Committee comprises more than 15 senior managers who are
charged with advising on D&I strategy and providing leadership support and advocacy for our D&I efforts. Our Human Resources leadership team
works to further shape the D&I strategy for our global workforce, and to ensure the integration of our D&I efforts with our global talent acquisition
and development processes. We have various early career programs open to a diverse range of applicants and a regional scholarship program that is
focused on underrepresented groups.
Our insurance operations support a range of employee-led D&I networks and resource groups, including our Markel Women's Network, BEAM (Black
Engagement at Markel), PRISM (LGBTQ+), Jitneys (Young Professionals), Markel Asian Professionals Network, Markel Veterans Network, UN1DOS
(Latin and Hispanic Network), and across our international operations, an Inclusion Network with connections to a number of the London market
partner networks. All of these networks and organizations have put in place goals and programming that are focused on education and development,
community engagement, talent acquisition and networking/support. Additionally, we continue our global sponsorship of Dive-In, the insurance
industry's annual diversity and inclusion festival.
Markel Ventures
Our Markel Ventures operations are comprised of a diverse portfolio of businesses from different industries through which we own controlling
interests. The Markel Ventures operations are viewed by management as separate and distinct from our insurance operations with local management
teams that direct the strategy and day-to-day operations of their respective companies, including human capital matters. When making these
acquisitions, we seek, among other things, businesses whose leadership teams demonstrate equal measures of both integrity and talent. As a result,
each Markel Ventures business fosters a culture within their operations, and with their employees, that aligns with the principles of the Markel Style.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
A wide range of factors could materially affect our future prospects and performance. The matters addressed in Item 7 Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including under "Safe Harbor and Cautionary Statement" and "Critical Accounting
Estimates", and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, as well as other information included or incorporated in this
report, describe many of the significant risks that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to the
risks discussed below.
One or more of the risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, and others we cannot anticipate, could have material adverse effects on our results
of operations and financial condition; and the extent of these effects will depend, at least in part, on the scope, severity, frequency or duration of the
specific event or circumstance. In addition, we may take steps to prevent, mitigate or manage potential risks or liabilities, and related developments,
and some of those steps may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Even if an unfavorable outcome
does not materialize, these factors, and actions we may take in response, may have a material adverse impact on our reputation or result in
substantial expense and disruption.
Headings and sub-headings for the Risk Factors below are for reference purposes only and are not intended to limit or affect in any way the meaning
or scope of each Risk Factor.
Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations
Loss Exposures
We may experience losses or disruptions from catastrophes. As a company with significant property and casualty insurance underwriting
operations, we may experience losses from man-made or natural catastrophes. Catastrophes include, but are not limited to, windstorms, hurricanes,
earthquakes, tornadoes, derechos, hail, severe winter weather and wildfires and may include pandemics and events related to terrorism, broad
reaching cyberattacks, riots and political and civil unrest. While we employ catastrophe modeling tools in our underwriting process, we cannot predict
how severe a potential catastrophe will be before it occurs. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of losses
incurred, the number of insureds affected, the frequency and severity of the events, the effectiveness of our catastrophe risk management program
and the adequacy of our reinsurance coverage. Most catastrophes occur over a small geographic area; however, some catastrophes may produce
significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. In addition, catastrophes may have a material adverse effect on the investment management
and incentive fees earned by our insurance-linked securities (ILS) operations and returns on our investments in ILS funds. Catastrophes also may
result in significant disruptions in our insurance and other operations, as well as loss of income and assets. If climate change results in an increase in
the frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophes, we may experience additional or elevated catastrophe-related losses or disruptions,
which may be material.
The failure of any of the methods we employ to manage our loss exposures could have a material adverse effect on us. We seek to
manage our loss exposures in a variety of ways, including adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones, limiting
program size for each client, establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event, employing coverage restrictions and following
prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written. We also seek to manage our loss exposures through geographic and industry
diversification. Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control,
and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more future events could result in claims that
substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we
seek to manage our loss exposures by policy terms, coverage exclusions and choice of legal forum. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal
forum also arise. As a result, various provisions of our policies, such as choice of forum, or coverage limitations or exclusions, may not be enforceable
in the manner we intend and some or all of our methods to manage loss exposures may prove ineffective.
The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing
the frequency and/or severity of claims. For example, rising costs, litigation funding, social inflation, higher adverse verdicts, and legislative changes,
such as extended statutes of limitations, may result in higher and more frequent claims over a longer reporting period than originally expected. In
some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are
10K - 22

affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a
contract is issued.
We use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and actual
results may differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses. We use various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g.,
scenarios, predictive and stochastic modeling, and forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our
insurance and ILS businesses. This includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in, among other
things, decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk. We incorporate
numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity
markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related analyses from both
proprietary models and third-party models are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors, complexities and the inherent
limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and industry data and assumptions.
In addition, the modeled outputs and related analyses may from time to time contain inaccuracies, perhaps in material respects, including as a result
of inaccurate inputs or applications thereof (whether due to data error, human error or otherwise). Consequently, actual results may differ materially
from our modeled results. Our profitability and financial condition substantially depend on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent
with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or fail to
appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
Loss Reserves
Our results may be affected because actual insured or reinsured losses differ from our loss reserves. Significant periods of time often
elapse between the occurrence of an insured or reinsured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for
unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses
and the related loss adjustment expenses. The process of estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex exercise involving many variables and
subjective judgments. This process may also become more difficult if we experience a period of rising inflation, as has been the case since early
2021.
As part of the reserving process, we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors, such as:
• trends in claim frequency and severity;
• changes in operations;
• changes to mix of business, terms and conditions, limits and layers;
• emerging economic and social trends;
• trends in insurance rates;
• inflation or deflation; and
• changes in the regulatory and litigation environments.
This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for
predicting future events. There is no precise method, however, for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, and
actual results will differ from original estimates. As part of the reserving process, we regularly review our loss reserves and make adjustments as
necessary. Future increases in loss reserves for our underwriting operations will, and for our programs services operations may, result in additional
charges to earnings, which may be material.
In addition, as discussed above, we use analytical models to assist our decision making in loss reserving, and actual results may differ materially from
the model outputs and related analyses.
There is generally greater uncertainty in estimating reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability, professional liability and workers'
compensation, as they require a longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in economic and social inflation
and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. In addition, reinsurance reserves are subject
to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because a reinsurer relies on (i) the original underwriting decisions and claims decisions
made by ceding companies and (ii) information and data from ceding companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies
may not have adequately evaluated the risks reinsured by us and the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we
10K - 23

assume. In addition, reinsurance reserves may be less reliable than insurance reserves because there is generally a longer lapse of time from the
occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss or benefit to the reinsurer and ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss. Reserves for contracts
for which we are not the primary insurer, and participate only in excess layers of loss, are also subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves
for contracts for which we are the primary insurer for many of the same reasons as reinsurance reserves.
Changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book could result in
material increases in our estimated loss reserves for such business. Our run-off life and annuity reinsurance book exposes us to mortality
risk, which is the risk that the level of death claims may differ from that which we assumed in establishing the reserves for our life and annuity
reinsurance contracts. Some of our life and annuity reinsurance contracts expose us to longevity risk, which is the risk that an insured person will live
longer than expected when the reserves were established, or morbidity risk, which is the risk that an insured person will become critically ill or
disabled. Our reserving process for the life and annuity reinsurance book is designed with the objective of establishing appropriate reserves for the
risks we assumed. Among other things, this process relies heavily on analysis of mortality, longevity and morbidity trends, lapse rates, interest rates
and expenses. As of December 31, 2022, our reserves for life and annuity benefits totaled $759.0 million.
We expect mortality, morbidity, longevity, and lapse experience to fluctuate somewhat from period to period, but believe they should remain
reasonably predictable over a period of many years. Mortality, longevity, morbidity or lapse experience that is less favorable than the mortality,
longevity, morbidity or lapse rates that we used in establishing the reserves for a reinsurance agreement will negatively affect our net income
because the reserves we originally set for the risks we assumed may not be sufficient to cover the future claims and expense payments.
Furthermore, even if the total benefits paid over the life of the contract do not exceed the expected amount, unexpected increases in the incidence
of deaths or illness can result in changes to our assumptions in a given reporting period, adversely affecting our net income in any particular
reporting period. If there are changes to any of the above factors to the point where a reserve deficiency exists, a charge to earnings will be
recorded, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Ceded Reinsurance
We may be unable to purchase reinsurance protection on terms acceptable to us, or we may be unable to collect on loss recoveries
from reinsurers. Our underwriting operations purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage our net retention on individual risks
and mitigate the volatility of losses on our results of operations and financial condition, while providing us with the ability to offer policies with
sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. In addition, we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our program services business, however,
we have certain programs that contain limits on our reinsurers' obligations to us that expose us to underwriting risk, including loss ratio caps,
aggregate reinsurance limits or exclusion of the credit risk of producers. See note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under
Item 8 for information about ceded reinsurance for our program services businesses.
The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies. Reliance on reinsurance recoveries
may create credit risk as a result of the reinsurer's inability or unwillingness to pay reinsurance claims when due. We generally select well capitalized
and highly rated reinsurers and in certain instances we require reinsurers to post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks. Deterioration in
the credit quality of existing reinsurers or disputes over the terms of reinsurance could result in charges to earnings, which may have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, collateral may not be sufficient to cover the reinsurer's obligation to
us, and we may not be able to cause the reinsurer to deliver additional collateral.
As of December 31, 2022, we were the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $5.0 billion,
collateralizing $8.4 billion in reinsurance recoverables. The remaining unsecured reinsurance recoverables are ceded to highly-rated, well capitalized
reinsurers. Our reinsurance recoverables are based on estimates, and our actual liabilities may exceed the amount we are able to recover from our
reinsurers or any collateral securing the reinsurance recoverables. The failure of a reinsurer to meet its obligations to us, whether due to insolvency,
dispute or other unwillingness or inability to pay, or due to our inability to access sufficient collateral to cover our liabilities, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The availability and cost of reinsurance are determined by market conditions beyond our control. There is no guarantee that our desired amounts of
reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future. In addition, available capacity may not be on terms we
deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do
10K - 24

business. This could impact our ability to write certain products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.
Market Competition and Broker Reliance
Competition in the insurance and reinsurance markets could reduce profits from our insurance operations. Insurance and reinsurance
markets are highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major United States (U.S.), Bermuda, United Kingdom (U.K.),
European, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, marketing, and
management resources than we do, have greater access to "big data," and may be able to offer a wider range of, or more sophisticated, commercial
and personal lines products. Recent industry consolidation, including business combinations among insurance and other financial services companies,
has resulted in larger competitors with even greater financial resources. In addition, capital market participants have created alternative products
that are intended to compete with reinsurance products.
Similar to other industries, the insurance industry is undergoing rapid and significant technological and other changes. There is increasing focus by
traditional insurance industry participants, technology companies, "InsurTech" start-up companies and others on using technology and innovation to
simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, redesign products, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive
changes in the insurance industry. If we do not anticipate, keep pace with and adapt to technological and other changes impacting the insurance
industry, it will harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products to customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences in the markets in which we operate also pose other risks to our
businesses. For example, they could result in increasing our service, administrative, policy acquisition or general expenses as we seek to distinguish
our products and services from those of our competitors or otherwise keep up with such innovation and changes.
Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce
our underwriting profits, or within our program services operations, our operating profits, and have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.
The historical cyclicality in the property and casualty insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
improve or maintain underwriting profits or to grow or maintain premium volume. The insurance and reinsurance markets have historically
been cyclical, characterized by extended periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, and more recently alternative
sources of capital, as well as brief periods when shortages of capacity permitted more favorable rate levels. Among our competitive strengths have
been our specialty product focus and our niche market strategy. These strengths also make us vulnerable in periods of intense competition to actions
by other insurance companies who seek to write additional premiums without appropriate regard for underwriting profitability. At times it could be
very difficult for us to grow or maintain premium volume levels without sacrificing underwriting profits. If we are not successful in maintaining rates
or achieving rate increases, it may be difficult for us to improve or maintain underwriting profits or to grow or maintain premium volume levels.
Our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be
successful and may increase or create new risks. From time to time, to protect and grow market share or improve our efficiency, we invest in
strategic initiatives to:
• develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, include new coverages or change coverage terms;
• change commission terms;
• change our underwriting processes;
• improve business processes and workflow to increase efficiencies and productivity and to enhance the experience of our customers and
producers;
• expand distribution channels; and
• enter geographic markets where we previously have had relatively little or no market share.
We may not be successful in these efforts, and even if we are successful, they may increase or create the following risks, among others:
• demand for new products or expansion into new markets may not meet our expectations;
10K - 25

• new products and expansion into new markets may increase or change our risk exposures, and the data and models we use to manage those
exposures may not be as effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products;
• models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective;
• efforts to develop new products or markets or to change commission terms may create or increase distribution channel conflicts;
• in connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase while the pricing for
other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins; and
• changes to our business processes or workflow, including the use of new technologies, may give rise to execution risk.
These efforts may require us to make substantial expenditures, which may negatively impact results in the near term, and if not successful, could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
We depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues and the loss of business provided by any one of them could have a
material adverse effect on us. We market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide through insurance and reinsurance brokers. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, our top three independent brokers represented 28% of the gross premiums written by our underwriting operations. Loss
of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Financial Strength and Credit Ratings
Our insurance companies and senior debt are rated by various rating agencies, and a downgrade or potential downgrade in one or
more of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on us. Financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Our senior debt ratings also affect the availability and cost of capital. Certain of our
insurance and reinsurance company subsidiaries and our senior debt securities are rated by various rating agencies. Our financial strength and debt
ratings are subject to periodic review, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. The financial strength ratings of our insurance
subsidiaries are significantly influenced by their statutory surplus amounts and leverage and capital adequacy ratios and other financial metrics.
Rating agencies may implement changes to their ratings methodologies or internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the
amount of capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold or restrict how the company may deploy its capital in order to maintain its current ratings. For
example, for certain of our insurance subsidiaries, rating agencies may take into account in their calculations the collateral provided to us by
reinsurers. A change in this practice could adversely impact our ratings. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our current, or any future,
ratings. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by one or more rating agencies, our competitive position in our target markets within the
insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A ratings downgrade could result in a substantial loss of
business as policyholders and ceding company clients move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. In addition,
a downgrade could trigger contract provisions that allow cedents to terminate their reinsurance contracts on terms disadvantageous to us or require
us to collateralize our obligations through trusts or letters of credit. A ratings downgrade could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
including the availability of our letter of credit facilities, and limit our access to capital markets, increase our cost of borrowing or issuing debt and
require us to post collateral.
The amount of capital that our insurance subsidiaries have and must hold to maintain their financial strength and credit ratings and
meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors, some of which are outside
of our control. Capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators, while rating agencies
establish requirements that inform ratings for our insurance subsidiaries and senior debt securities. Projecting surplus and the related capital
requirements is complex and requires making assumptions regarding how our business will perform within the broader macroeconomic environment.
Insurance regulators and rating agencies evaluate company capital through financial models that calculate minimum capitalization requirements
based on risk-based capital formulas for property and casualty insurance groups and their subsidiaries. In any particular year, capital levels and risk-
based capital requirements may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business written by our insurance
subsidiaries and correlation or diversification in the business profile, the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support
business growth, the value of securities in our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as
changes to the regulatory and rating agency models used to determine our required capital.

Insurance Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation that may have a material adverse effect on our operations and
financial condition. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the regulatory authorities in the various jurisdictions in
which they conduct business, including foreign and U.S. state insurance regulators. Regulatory authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and
administrative powers relating to, among other things, data protection and data privacy, cybersecurity, solvency standards, licensing, coverage
requirements, product terms and conditions, policy rates and forms, business and claims practices, disclosures to consumers, and the form and
content of financial reports. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be
generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. Insurance
regulatory authorities have broad authority to initiate investigations or other proceedings, and, in connection with a failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations, could impose adverse consequences, including fines, penalties, injunctions, denial or revocation of an operating license or
approval, increased scrutiny or oversight, limitations on engaging in a particular business, or redress to clients. These actions also could result in
negative publicity, reputational damage or harm to client, employee or other relationships. Additionally, regulatory and legislative authorities
continue to implement enhanced or new regulatory requirements to assure the stability of insurance companies or enhance policyholder protections
or, in certain instances, intended to prevent or mitigate future financial crises. Regulatory authorities also may seek to exercise their supervisory or
enforcement authority in new or more extensive ways, such as increased capital requirements. These actions, if they occur, could affect the
competitive market, as well as the way we conduct our business or manage our capital, and could result in lower revenues and higher costs. As a
result, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Regulators may challenge our use of fronting arrangements in states in which our capacity providers are not licensed. Our program
services business enters into fronting arrangements with general agents and domestic and foreign insurers that want to access specific U.S. property
and casualty insurance business in states in which the capacity providers are not licensed or are not authorized to write particular lines of insurance.
Some state insurance regulators may object to these fronting arrangements. In certain states, an insurance commissioner has the authority to
prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer. In addition, insurance departments in states in which
there is no such statutory or regulatory prohibition, could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the
issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance.
If regulators in any of the states where we conduct our fronting business were to prohibit or limit those arrangements, we would be prevented or
limited from conducting that business for which a capacity provider is not authorized in those states, unless and until the capacity provider is able to
obtain the necessary licenses. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Insurance-Linked Securities
Our ILS operations and our management of third-party capital may expose us to risks. Some of our operating subsidiaries may owe certain
legal duties and obligations to third-party investors. A failure to fulfill any of those duties or obligations could result in significant liabilities, penalties
or other losses, and harm our businesses and results of operations. In addition, third-party investors may decide not to renew their investments in the
funds we manage, which could materially impact the financial condition of those funds, and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain or raise additional third-party capital for the funds we
manage or for potential new funds and therefore we may forego existing or potential fee income and other income generating opportunities. For
example, investment performance at Nephila, as well as the broader ILS market, has been adversely impacted by consecutive years of elevated
catastrophe losses, as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These events, as well as volatility in the capital markets, also have impacted
investor decisions around allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn have impacted, and may continue to impact, our capital raises and redemptions
within the funds we manage, as well as new funds, resulting in a decline in assets under management. See "Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill
and Intangible Assets" under Item 7. Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion and
considerations of these impacts on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets attributed to our Nephila ILS operations.
Developments at our Markel CATCo operations could have a material adverse effect on us. In December 2018, the U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) initiated inquiries into loss reserves recorded
in late 2017 and early 2018 at Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (the Markel CATCo Inquiries). In September 2021, each of the SEC and DOJ notified us that it had
concluded its investigation and does not intend
10K - 27

to take any action against Markel CATCo Investment Management Ltd. There are currently no pending requests from the BMA, and it has been over
two years since the BMA has contacted the Company in relation to the Markel CATCo Inquiries.
Matters related to or arising from our Markel CATCo operations, including matters of which we are currently unaware, could result in additional
claims, litigation, investigations, enforcement actions or proceedings. For example, while prior litigation was dismissed or settled, additional litigation
may be filed by investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. We also could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, investigations or proceedings in
any of the jurisdictions where we operate. If any regulatory authority takes action against us or we enter into an agreement to settle a matter, we
may incur sanctions or be required to pay substantial fines or implement remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our businesses
and operations. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, and others we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, these matters, and actions we may take in
response, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, limit our access to capital markets and result in substantial expense and disruption.
In addition, we may take steps to mitigate potential risks or liabilities related to or arising from our Markel CATCo operations. For example, see note
21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for information regarding a buy-out transaction that accelerated a full
return of remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds, which are currently in run-off. Other steps we may take to mitigate potential risks
or liabilities related to or arising from our Markel CATCo operations could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments and Access to Capital
Changes in Economic Conditions
Our investment results may be impacted by changes in interest rates, U.S. and international monetary and fiscal policies as well as
broader economic conditions. We receive premiums from customers for insuring their risks. We invest these funds until they are needed to pay
policyholder claims. Fluctuations in the value of our investment portfolio can occur as a result of changes in interest rates and U.S. and international
fiscal, monetary and trade policies as well as broader economic conditions (including, for example, equity market conditions and significant or
prolonged inflation or deflation). Although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in these changing environments, we may
not be able to mitigate our sensitivity to them effectively. Despite our mitigation efforts, which include duration and currency targets for asset
portfolios, compliance monitoring of these targets and means to reasonably and effectively match asset duration and currency to the duration and
currency of the loss reserves, changes in interest rates and U.S. and international fiscal, monetary and trade policies as well as broader economic
conditions could have a material adverse effect on our investment results and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.
We invest a significant portion of our shareholders' equity in equity securities, which may result in significant variability in our
investment results and net income and may have a material adverse effect on shareholders' equity. Additionally, our equity
investment portfolio is concentrated, and declines in the value of these significant investments could have a material adverse effect
on our financial results and on our ability to carry out our business plans. Equity securities were 59% and 61% of our shareholders' equity at
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity securities have historically produced higher returns than fixed maturity securities over long
periods of time; however, investing in equity securities may result in significant variability in investment returns from one period to the next. In
volatile financial markets, we could experience significant declines in the fair value of our equity investment portfolio, which would result in a
material decrease in net income and shareholders' equity. Our equity portfolio is concentrated in particular issuers and industries and, as a result, a
decline in the fair value of these concentrated investments also could result in a material decrease in net income and shareholders' equity. A material
decrease in shareholders' equity may have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our business plans.
Access to Capital
We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. To the
extent that cash flows generated by our operations are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, or that our capital position is adversely
impacted by a decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio, losses from catastrophe events or otherwise, we may need to raise additional
funds through financings or curtail our growth. We also may be required to liquidate fixed maturity securities or equity securities, which may result in
realized investment losses. Any further sources of capital, including capacity needed for letters of credit, if available at all, may be on terms that are
unfavorable to us. Our access to additional sources of capital will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of
10K - 28

credit, the availability of credit to the industries in which we operate, our results of operations, financial condition, credit ratings and credit capacity,
as well as pending litigation or regulatory investigations. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and letter of credit facilities is
contingent on our compliance with the covenants and other requirements under those facilities. Similarly, our access to capital may be impaired if
regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Our inability to obtain adequate capital when needed could have a
negative impact on our ability to invest in, or take advantage of opportunities to expand, our businesses, such as possible acquisitions or the creation
of new ventures, and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms acceptable to us. Any of these effects could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our failure to comply with covenants and other requirements under our credit facilities, senior debt and other indebtedness could
have a material adverse effect on us. The agreements and indentures relating to our credit facilities, senior debt and other indebtedness,
including letter of credit facilities used by certain of our subsidiaries, contain covenants and other requirements. If we fail to comply with those
covenants or requirements, the lenders, noteholders or counterparties under those agreements and indentures could declare a default and demand
immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them. In addition, where applicable, our lenders may cancel their commitments to lend or issue letters
of credit or require us to pledge additional or a different type of collateral. A default under one debt agreement may also put us at risk of a cross-
default under other debt agreements or other arrangements. Any of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition.
Our liquidity and our ability to meet our debt and other obligations, and pay dividends on our preferred stock, depend on the receipt
of funds from our subsidiaries. We are a holding company, and as a result, our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt and other obligations,
and pay dividends on our preferred stock, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments
by our subsidiaries to us. The payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries, which account for a significant portion of our operating cash flows,
may require prior regulatory notice or approval or may be restricted by capital requirements imposed by regulatory authorities. Similarly, our
insurance subsidiaries may require capital contributions from us to satisfy their capital requirements. In addition, our reinsurance contracts typically
allow the cedent, upon a reduction in an insurance company's capital in excess of specified amounts, to terminate its contract on terms
disadvantageous to us or to exercise other remedies that may adversely affect us. Those contract provisions may have the effect of limiting
distributions by our insurance subsidiaries to us.
Risks Related to All of Our Operations
Legal and Regulatory Risks
The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses are extensive. Failure to comply could have a material adverse
effect on us. Each of our businesses is highly dependent on the ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of financial and operational
activities, including, among others, insurance underwriting, claim processing, investment activities, the management of third-party capital and
providing products and services to businesses and consumers, many of which are highly complex. These activities are subject to internal guidelines
and policies, as well as legal and regulatory requirements, including, among others, those related to privacy and data security, economic and trade
sanctions, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and global finance and investments, customer protection and insurance matters. Our continued expansion into
new businesses, distribution channels and markets brings about additional requirements. While we believe that we have adopted adequate and
effective risk management and compliance programs, compliance risks remain, particularly as we become subject to additional rules and regulations.
Failure to comply with, or to obtain, appropriate authorizations or exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on
our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Any such failure
could also subject us to fines, penalties, equitable relief and changes to our business practices. In addition, a failure to comply could result in defaults
under our senior unsecured debt agreements or credit facilities or damage our businesses or our reputation.
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel- and systems-intensive. Shareholder activism, the current political
environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and compliance
obligations. Any changes in, or the enactment of new, applicable laws and regulations may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in
which we operate, which could materially increase our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of doing business, and have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Losses from legal and regulatory actions may have a material adverse effect on us. From time to time we may be involved in various legal
actions, including at times multi-party or class action litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial
10K - 29

or indeterminate amounts. A significant unfavorable outcome in one or more of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. We are also involved from time to time in various regulatory actions, investigations and inquiries, including market
conduct exams by insurance regulatory authorities. If a regulatory authority takes action against us or we enter into a consent order or agreement to
settle a matter, a regulatory authority has the option to require us to pay substantial fines or implement remedial measures that could prove costly or
disruptive to our businesses and operations. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, these matters could have an adverse impact on
our reputation and result in substantial expense and disruption. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8
and Item 3 Legal Proceedings.
We are subject to laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions and bribery and corruption, the violation of which
could have a material adverse effect on us. We are required to comply with the economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs
administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies
worldwide, as well as applicable anti-corruption laws and anti-bribery and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. In some
cases we must comply with a large number of new economic, financial and trade sanctions that are imposed over a short period of time, as occurred
with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. A violation of a sanction, embargo program, or anti-corruption law, could subject us, and individual employees, to a
regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. In addition, a violation could result in defaults under our outstanding
indebtedness or credit facilities or damage our businesses or our reputation. Those penalties or defaults, or damage to our businesses or reputation,
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In some cases the requirements and limitations applicable
to the global operations of U.S. companies and their affiliates are more restrictive than, and may even conflict with, those applicable to non-U.S.
companies and their affiliates, which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. There have been a number
of cases involving misconduct by employees in a broad range of industries in recent years, and we run the risk of misconduct by our employees.
Instances of misconduct, fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, or failure to
comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses or reputational damage. It is not always possible to deter or prevent
employee errors or misconduct, and the controls and trainings that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
cases.
Global Operations
We manage our global operations through a network of business entities, which could result in inconsistent management,
governance and oversight practices. We manage our global operations through a network of business entities located in the U.S., Bermuda, the
U.K., Europe and elsewhere. These business entities are managed by executives, and supported by shared and centralized services; however, for
certain of our businesses, subsidiary-level management is responsible for day-to-day operations, profitability, personnel decisions, the growth of the
business, and legal and regulatory compliance, including adherence to applicable local laws. Operating through subsidiary-level management can
make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations. In addition, some of our
business entities operate with management, sales, and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective locations and
industries, without significant central oversight and coordination. We continue to enhance our operating, governance and oversight procedures to
effectively support, and improve transparency throughout, our global operations and network of business entities; however, our operating strategy
nonetheless could result in inconsistent management, governance, and oversight practices, which may have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.
We have substantial international operations and investments, which expose us to increased political, civil, operational and
economic risks. A substantial portion of our revenues and income is derived from our operations and investments outside the U.S., including from
the U.K., Bermuda and Europe. Our international operations and investments expose us to increased political, civil, operational and economic risks.
Deterioration or volatility in foreign and international financial markets or general economic and political and civil conditions could adversely affect
our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Concerns about the economic conditions, capital markets, political, civil and economic stability
and solvency of certain countries may contribute to global market volatility. Political and civil changes in the jurisdictions where we operate and
elsewhere, some of which may be disruptive, can also interfere with our customers and our activities in a particular location. Our international
operations also may be subject to a number of additional risks, particularly in emerging economies, including restrictions such as price controls,
capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions or requirements, which
could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
10K - 30

General economic, market or industry conditions could lead to investment losses, adverse effects on our businesses and limit our
access to the capital markets. General economic and market conditions and industry specific conditions, including extended economic recessions
or expansions; prolonged periods of slow economic growth; inflation or deflation; fluctuations and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity and energy prices and interest rates; volatility in the credit and capital markets; the imposition of tariffs and other changes in
international trade regulation and other factors, could lead to: substantial realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods; declines in
demand for, or increased frequency and severity of claims made under, our insurance products; disruptions in global supply chains and increased
costs of inputs for our products and services; reduced demand for our services and the products we sell and distribute; and limited or no access to
the capital markets. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, debt and financial
strength ratings or our insurance subsidiaries' capital. Results for many of our Markel Ventures businesses have been, and may continue to be,
adversely affected by increased costs of labor and materials, including, with respect to increased materials costs, due to shortages in the availability
of certain products, higher shipping costs and inflation. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of these cost increases may not be successful and, even
when they are successful, there may be a time lag before the impacts of these efforts are reflected in our results.
Our businesses, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and
Ukraine and related disruptions in the global economy. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between
Russia and Ukraine. While we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, some of our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely
affected by this conflict and its effects. Within our underwriting operations, we have insurance contracts with exposure to losses attributed to the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, which we discuss under Item 7 Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our
other operations do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in Russia or Ukraine. However, certain of our businesses have
experienced, and may continue to experience, shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to
the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the global economy.
Furthermore, governments in the U.S., U.K., and European Union, among others, have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial
and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. These export controls and sanctions, or our failure to comply with them,
could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business or have the other adverse
effects discussed above under this Item 1A. Risk Factors under "We are subject to laws and regulations relating to economic and trade sanctions and
bribery and corruption, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us."
We are unable to predict the impact the ongoing conflict will have on our businesses or the global economy. The impact of further escalation of
geopolitical tensions related to this conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, is unknown and could result in, among
other things, heightened cybersecurity threats, supply disruptions, protracted or increased inflation, increased energy costs, lower consumer
demand, fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and increased volatility in financial markets, any of which could adversely affect our
businesses, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the ongoing conflict may have the effect of triggering or intensifying many of the
risks described under this Item 1A Risk Factors under Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations, Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments
and Access to Capital, and Risks Related to All of Our Operations.
Acquisitions, Integration and Retention
The integration of acquired companies may not be as successful as we anticipate. We have completed, and expect to complete,
acquisitions in an effort to achieve profitable growth in our underwriting and other insurance operations and to create additional value on a
diversified basis in our Markel Ventures operations. Acquisitions present operational, regulatory, strategic and financial risks, as well as risks
associated with liabilities arising from the previous operations of the acquired companies. We also must make decisions about the degree to which
we integrate acquisitions into our existing businesses, operations and systems, and over what timeframe. Those decisions may adversely affect how
successfully the acquired businesses perform, both in the short-term and in the long-term. All of these risks are magnified in the case of a large
acquisition. Integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies may prove more difficult than anticipated, which may result in failure
to achieve financial objectives associated with the acquisition or diversion of management attention. In addition, integration of formerly privately-
held companies into the management and internal control and financial reporting systems of a publicly-held company presents additional risks. See
note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for information about our recent acquisitions.
10K - 31

Impairment in the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $4.4 billion and represented 34% of shareholders' equity. We
record goodwill and intangible assets at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid to acquire
businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Declines in operating results, divestitures,
sustained market declines and other factors that impact the fair value of a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible
assets and, in turn, a charge to net income. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Developments that adversely affect the future cash flows or earnings of an acquired business may cause the goodwill or intangible assets recorded
for it to be impaired. See "Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill and Intangible Assets" included under Item 7 Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for
information about our goodwill and intangible assets.
The loss of one or more key executives or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect
on us. Our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel
in the future. The temporary or permanent loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified
personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct or grow our business.
Information Technology Systems and Third-Party Systems and Service Providers
Information technology systems that we use could fail or suffer a security breach or cyberattack, which could have a material
adverse effect on us or result in the loss of regulated or sensitive information. Our businesses are dependent upon the operational
effectiveness and security of our enterprise systems and those maintained by third parties. Among other things, we rely on these systems to interact
with producers, insureds, customers, clients, and other third parties, to perform actuarial and other modeling functions, to underwrite business, to
prepare policies and process premiums, to process claims and make claims payments, to prepare internal and external financial statements and
information, as well as to engage in a wide variety of other business activities. A significant failure of our enterprise systems, or those of third parties
upon which we may rely, whether because of a natural disaster, network outage or a cyberattack on those systems, including ransomware, could
compromise our personal, confidential and proprietary information as well as that of our customers and business partners, impede or interrupt our
business operations and could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and
fines, litigation and monetary and reputational damages. In addition, if we are unable to innovate, develop and acquire new technology, it may leave
us more susceptible to these attacks. Like other companies, we have been subject to cyberattacks, malicious viruses and malware, and denial of
service attacks and expect that this will continue in the future with greater sophistication and frequency. Despite any controls or protective actions
we take against such attacks, those measures may be insufficient to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, a natural disaster, network outage or a
cyberattack on our systems. This could result in liability to us, cause our data to be corrupted or stolen and cause us to commit resources to correct
those failures.
In addition, we are subject to numerous data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations enacted in the jurisdictions in which we do business. A
misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer, business partner, employee or
third party could damage our businesses or our reputation or result in significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and
criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the European General Data Protection Regulation there are significant
punishments for non-compliance which could result in a penalty of up to 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a violation of data privacy
laws and regulations could result in defaults under our outstanding indebtedness or credit facilities. Those monetary damages, penalties, regulatory
or legal actions or defaults, or the damage to our businesses or reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. Third parties who we utilize to perform certain functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws
and regulations also could damage our businesses or reputation or result in regulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
Further, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other digital means. Although we
attempt to protect this personal, confidential and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so in all cases, especially with business partners
and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential and proprietary information.
10K - 32

While we maintain cyber risk insurance providing first-party and third-party coverages, that insurance may not cover all costs associated with the
consequences of an enterprise failure, cyberattack, or breach of systems. A material cyber security breach could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.
Third-party providers may perform poorly, breach their obligations to us or expose us to enhanced risks. Certain of our business
functions are performed by third-party providers, and these providers may not perform as expected or may fail to adhere to the obligations owed to
us. For example, certain of our business units rely on relationships with a number of third-party administrators under contracts pursuant to which
these third-party administrators manage and pay claims on our behalf and advise us with respect to case reserves. In these relationships, we rely on
controls incorporated in the provisions of the administration agreement, as well as on the administrator's internal controls, to manage the claims
process within our prescribed parameters. In addition, certain of our business units use managing general agents, general agents and other
producers to write and administer business on our behalf within prescribed underwriting authorities. Although we monitor these administrators,
agents, producers and other service providers on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate, or our service providers could
exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us, which could result in operational disruption, reputational damage and regulatory
intervention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
In addition, we utilize third parties to perform certain technology and business process functions, such as data center hosting, cloud based operating
environments, human resources and other outsourced services. We have developed and implemented an outsourcing strategy, however, if third-
party providers do not perform as expected, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business, or we may not realize
expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies. Our use of third parties to perform certain technology and business process functions may
expose us to risks related to privacy and data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive
services from third-party providers might be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including political and civil instability, supply chain disruptions,
volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, wide-spread health issues, unanticipated or additional regulatory requirements or policies. As a
result, our ability to conduct our businesses may be adversely affected.
Pandemics
Pandemics have had, and could have, material adverse effects on us. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and its variants or future pandemics
could have, material adverse effects on our underwriting, investment, Markel Ventures and other operations, and on our results of operations and
financial condition. The effects of a pandemic, and related governmental responses, may be wide-ranging, costly, disruptive and rapidly changing.
Factors that give rise, or may give rise, to those effects include, or may include, the following, as well as others that we cannot predict:
• Insured or reinsured losses from pandemic-related claims that are different, or more extensive, than we expect;
• Government actions or judicial decisions related to insurance or reinsurance coverages or rates, including, for example, requiring retroactive
coverage of claims or expanding the scope of coverage;
• Disputes, lawsuits and other legal actions challenging the promptness of coverage determinations, or the coverage determinations
themselves, under applicable insurance or reinsurance policies, resulting in increased claims, litigation and related expenses;
• Disruptions, delays and increased costs and risks related to having limited or no access to our facilities, workplace re-entry, employee safety
concerns and reductions or interruptions of critical or essential services;
• Continually changing business conditions and compliance obligations; and
• Short or long-term impacts on the cost, availability or timeliness of required raw materials, supplies or services provided by third parties,
including services provided by state, federal or foreign governments or government agencies.
In addition, a pandemic may, as has been the case with COVID-19, have the effect of triggering or intensifying many of the risks described elsewhere
under this Item 1A. Risk Factors under Risks Primarily Related to Our Insurance Operations, Risks Primarily Related to Our Investments and Access to
Capital, and Risks Related to All of Our Operations.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation
In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of Aspen Holdings, Inc. (Aspen). As part of the consideration for that acquisition, Aspen shareholders
received contingent value rights (CVRs). Prior to the December 31, 2017 CVR maturity date, the CVR holder representative, Thomas Yeransian,
disputed our prior estimation of the value of the CVRs. On September 15, 2016, Mr. Yeransian filed a suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation
(U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware), alleging, among other things, that we are in default under the CVR agreement. The suit seeks: $47.3
million in damages, which represents the unadjusted value of the CVRs; plus interest ($23.6 million through December 31, 2022) and default interest
(up to an additional $20.8 million through December 31, 2022, depending on the date any default occurred); and an unspecified amount of punitive
damages, costs, and attorneys' fees.
At the initial hearing held February 21, 2017, the court stayed the proceedings and ordered the parties to discuss resolving the dispute pursuant to
the independent CVR valuation procedure under the CVR agreement. The parties met on April 5, 2017, but were unsuccessful in reaching agreement
on a process for resolving the dispute. We subsequently filed a motion to stay the litigation and compel arbitration, and, on July 31, 2017, the court
issued an order granting that motion.
On November 13, 2018, Mr. Yeransian filed a second suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation (U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware),
which also alleges that the Company is in default under the CVR agreement. The second suit seeks the same monetary damages and relief as the
original suit. We filed a motion to stay this suit until the arbitration for the original suit has concluded and the CVR holders have received the final
amount due under the CVR Agreement. The court granted that motion on August 6, 2019.
On June 5, 2020, Yeransian filed a third suit, Thomas Yeransian v. Markel Corporation (U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware). Similar to the
first and second suits, the third suit alleges that the Company is in default under the CVR agreement and, in addition, has interfered with the
arbitration for the CVR valuation. The third suit seeks the same monetary damages and relief as the original suit and the second suit, as well as other
declaratory and non-monetary judgments and orders. We filed a motion to stay this suit, which the court granted on March 16, 2021.
Under the arbitration terms of the CVR Agreement, independent experts were appointed to determine the final value of the CVRs. On September 20,
2021, the experts delivered their report indicating a final CVR valuation of $22.4 million, excluding interest. We had previously paid $8.0 million to
the CVR holders, representing 90% of the undisputed value of the CVRs, plus interest of $1.9 million. On September 20, 2021, we paid $20.1 million,
which represents $14.1 million for the unpaid portion of the final CVR amount (excluding fees payable to a third party), plus $6.0 million in additional
interest.
The stay has been lifted on each pending suit, and the three suits have been consolidated. We have asked the court to dismiss, or grant us summary
judgment on, all counts.
We believe Mr. Yeransian's suits to be without merit. We further believe that any material loss resulting from the suits to be remote.

(1) Amortization of intangible assets includes all amortization attributable to our insurance operations. Amortization of intangible assets attributable to our underwriting
segments was $38.5 million and $41.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; however, we do not allocate amortization of intangible assets
between the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Amortization of intangible assets attributable to our insurance-linked securities, program services and other insurance
operations was $61.2 million and $61.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(2) Impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to our Nephila ILS operations.
(3) Segment profit for the Markel Ventures segment includes amortization of intangible assets attributable to Markel Ventures.
Our 2022 results were significantly impacted by decreases in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Net investment losses on our equity portfolio
reflect the impact of volatility and overall decline in the public equity markets. The decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio were
primarily due to increases in interest rates in 2022. Volatility in the public equity and bond markets reflects the impact of economic uncertainty and
broader market conditions, which are impacting all three of our operating engines, including high levels of inflation, rising interest rates and global
supply chain disruptions.
The change in comprehensive income (loss) to shareholders in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to pre-tax net investment losses of $1.6
billion in 2022, compared to pre-tax net investment gains of $2.0 billion in 2021, as well as pre-tax net unrealized losses on our fixed maturity
securities of $1.5 billion in 2022 compared to $504.1 million in 2021.
The components of net income (loss) to shareholders and comprehensive income (loss) to shareholders are discussed in further detail under

Insurance Results
Our Insurance engine includes our underwriting, insurance-linked securities (ILS), program services and other fronting operations. We have a suite of
capabilities through which we can access capital to support our customers' risks, which includes our own capital through our underwriting operations
and third-party capital through our ILS and program services operations. Our underwriting operations, which are primarily comprised of our Insurance
and Reinsurance segments, produce revenues primarily by underwriting insurance contracts and earning premiums in the specialty insurance
market. Our insurance-linked securities and program services operations produce revenues primarily through fees earned for investment
management services and fronting services, respectively. Our insurance operations also include the underwriting results of run-off lines of business
that were discontinued prior to, or in conjunction with, insurance acquisitions, and the results of our run-off life and annuity reinsurance business. The
following table presents the components of our Insurance engine gross premium volume and operating revenues.

(1) Substantially all gross premiums from our program services business and other fronting arrangements were ceded to third parties for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021.
Underwriting Results
Underwriting profits are a key component of our strategy to build shareholder value. We believe that the ability to achieve consistent underwriting
profits demonstrates knowledge and expertise, commitment to superior customer service and the ability to manage insurance risk. The property and
casualty insurance industry commonly defines underwriting profit or loss as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and
underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. We use underwriting profit or loss and the combined ratio as a basis for evaluating our
underwriting performance. The U.S. GAAP combined ratio is a measure of underwriting performance and represents the relationship of incurred
losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses to earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the
loss ratio and the expense ratio. The loss ratio represents the relationship of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums. The
expense ratio represents the relationship of underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses to earned premiums. A combined ratio less than 100%
indicates an underwriting profit, while a combined ratio greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss.
In addition to the U.S. GAAP combined ratio, loss ratio and expense ratio, we also evaluate our underwriting performance using measures that
exclude the impacts of certain items on these ratios. We believe these adjusted measures, which are non-GAAP measures, provide financial
statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise our underwriting results and how management evaluates
underwriting performance.
When analyzing our combined ratio, we exclude current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to natural catastrophes. We
also exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to certain significant, infrequent loss events, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic and
the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Due to the unique characteristics
of a catastrophe loss and other significant, infrequent events, there is inherent variability as to the timing or loss amount, which cannot be predicted
in advance. We believe measures that exclude the effects of catastrophe events, COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are meaningful to
understand the underlying trends and variability in our underwriting results that may be obscured by these items.
10K - 40

When analyzing our loss ratio, we evaluate losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to the current accident year separate from losses and
loss adjustment expenses attributable to prior accident years. Prior accident year reserve development, which can either be favorable or unfavorable,
represents changes in our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to loss events that occurred in prior years. We believe a
discussion of current accident year loss ratios, which exclude prior accident year reserve development, is helpful since it provides more insight into
estimates of current underwriting performance and excludes changes in estimates related to prior year loss reserves. We also analyze our current
accident year loss ratio excluding losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to catastrophes and, in 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The
current accident year loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and other significant, infrequent loss events is also commonly referred to as an
attritional loss ratio within the property and casualty insurance industry.
The following table presents summary data for our consolidated underwriting operations, which are comprised predominantly of our Insurance and
Reinsurance segments. Our consolidated underwriting results also include results from discontinued lines of business and the retained portion of our
program services operations.

Premiums
The increase in gross premium volume in our underwriting operations in 2022 was driven by growth within our Insurance segment across all product
lines. Net retention of gross premium volume for our underwriting operations was 83% in 2022 compared to 84% in 2021. The decrease in net
retention in 2022 was driven by lower retention within our Insurance segment, partially offset by higher retention within our Reinsurance segment.
Within our underwriting operations, we purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage our net retention on individual risks and
overall exposure to losses and to enable us to write policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. The increase in earned premiums in our
underwriting operations in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher gross premium volume.
10K - 41

Since 2018, we have seen rate strengthening across most product lines following the continued high level of natural catastrophes and significant
losses attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general market conditions. However, we began to see rate increases moderate on many of
our product lines in 2022. In some product lines, such as directors and officers, we even began to see single digit rate decreases in the latter part of
2022. The overall strengthening of rates in recent years has been most prominent within our professional liability and general liability product lines,
reflecting the impacts of both economic and social inflation on loss costs. Recent increases in economic and social inflation have created more
uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on these longer-tail product lines. These factors, as well as the impacts of
the low interest rate environment on interest income in recent years, have contributed to the strong rate environment. The primary exception to the
favorable rate environment is workers' compensation, where we continue to see low single digit rate decreases given generally favorable loss
experience in recent years. When we believe the prevailing market price will not support our underwriting profit targets, the business is not written.
As a result of our underwriting discipline, gross premium volume may vary when we alter our product offerings to maintain or improve underwriting
profitability.
Combined Ratio
In 2022, underwriting results included $46.2 million and $35.7 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to Hurricane Ian and the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. The net losses and loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine conflict were net of
ceded losses of $115.3 million and $44.3 million, respectively. In 2021, underwriting results included $195.0 million of net losses and loss adjustment
expenses attributed to Winter Storm Uri, the floods in Europe and Hurricane Ida (2021 Catastrophes), as well as $15.7 million of net losses and loss
adjustment expenses resulting from an increase in our net estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to COVID-19. The net
losses and loss adjustment expenses from the 2021 Catastrophes were net of ceded losses of $221.7 million. Excluding these losses from the
respective periods, the increase in our consolidated combined ratio in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by the impact of less favorable
development on prior accident years loss reserves within our Insurance segment in 2022 compared to 2021, partially offset by a lower expense ratio
within our Insurance segment.
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
Our results reflect underwriting losses from the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022. The ongoing conflict has also contributed to certain aspects of the current economic conditions impacting all of our operations. For
further discussion regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict and risks related to our businesses, see the risk factor titled "Our businesses, results of
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related disruptions in the
global economy" under Item 1A Risk Factors.
Our losses and loss adjustment expenses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict are primarily attributed to business written within our international
insurance and reinsurance operations and are primarily associated with war and terrorism coverages within our marine and energy product lines, as
well as our trade credit and surety product lines. We purchase significant excess of loss reinsurance on the impacted product lines to reduce our net
exposures, resulting in significant ceded losses. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further
details on our estimate of ultimate gross and net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Our losses from the COVID-19 pandemic were primarily attributed to business written within our international insurance operations and were
primarily associated with coverages for event cancellation and business interruption losses on policies where no specific pandemic exclusion existed.
Our estimates of ultimate gross and net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to COVID-19 are based on reported claims and still include
assumptions about coverage, liability and ceded reinsurance contract attachment, which, in some cases, remain subject to judicial review, and
represent our best estimate as of December 31, 2022 based upon information currently available. We continue to closely monitor reported claims,
claim settlements, ceded reinsurance contract settlements and judicial decisions and may adjust our estimates as new information becomes
available.

Premiums
The increase in gross premium volume in our Insurance segment in 2022 was driven by new business volume, strong policy retention levels, more
favorable rates and expanded product offerings, resulting in growth across all of our product lines, most notably in our general liability and
professional liability product lines. Net retention of gross premium volume was 82% in 2022 compared to 83% in 2021. The decrease in net retention
for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher cession rates on our professional liability and personal lines product lines in 2022
compared to 2021, partially offset by the impact of higher retention rates on new programs business. The increase in earned premiums in 2022 was
primarily due to higher gross premium volume.
Combined Ratio
The Insurance segment's current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2022 included $46.2 million and $23.0 million of net losses
and loss adjustment expenses attributed to Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. Current accident year losses in 2021 included
$94.7 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to the 2021 Catastrophes. Excluding these losses from the respective periods,
the current accident year loss ratio in 2022 was consistent with 2021. Despite achieving higher premium rates on our professional liability and
general liability product lines, we generally kept our estimates of ultimate loss ratios on these product lines for the 2022 accident year consistent
with the 2021 accident year due to the unfavorable claims trend within these product lines on prior accident years during 2022 arising from current
and anticipated levels of economic and social inflation.
10K - 43

The Insurance segment's 2022 combined ratio included $142.9 million of favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves compared to
$506.3 million in 2021. The decrease in favorable development was primarily due to adverse development on our professional liability and general
liability product lines in 2022 compared to favorable development in 2021. Adverse development on our professional liability and general liability
product lines in 2022 was primarily attributable to unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity on a number of
products, including directors and officers, errors and omissions and employment practices liability within professional liability and contractors and
excess and umbrella within general liability. Development on prior years loss reserves within our professional liability and general liability product
lines in 2022 was impacted by broader market conditions, including the effects of economic and social inflation. These factors have created more
uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on these longer-tail product lines, and as a result, we are approaching
reductions to prior year loss reserves on more recent accident years cautiously. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly
to increase loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations, whereas in
instances where claims trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we are often waiting to reduce loss reserves and will evaluate our
experience over additional periods of time.
In 2022, favorable development was most significant on our workers' compensation, programs, property and credit and surety product lines. In 2021,
favorable development was most significant on our general liability, property, workers' compensation, professional liability and marine and energy
product lines. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for more information on the Insurance segment's
prior year loss reserve development.
The decrease in the Insurance segment's expense ratio in 2022 was primarily due to the favorable impact of higher earned premiums in 2022 while
maintaining consistent levels of general expenses with 2021, as we continue to focus on scaling our insurance operations.

Premiums
The modest decrease in gross premium volume in our Reinsurance segment in 2022 was primarily attributable to non-renewals within our property
product lines and the non-renewal of a large treaty within our workers' compensation product line, largely offset by the impact of new business,
primarily within our general liability and professional liability product lines, and more favorable premium adjustments within our credit and surety
product lines. We discontinued writing property retrocessional reinsurance in 2022 and property reinsurance in 2021, which resulted in a $123.3
million reduction in gross premium volume in 2022 compared to 2021. Significant variability in gross premium volume can be expected in our
Reinsurance segment due to individually significant contracts and multi-year contracts.
Net retention of gross premium volume was 95% in 2022 compared to 90% in 2021. The increase in net retention was driven by changes in mix of
business. We have experienced growth in highly retained product lines during the year, while the non-renewed property business had a lower
retention rate than the rest of the segment.
The increase in earned premiums in 2022 was primarily attributable to growth in gross premium volume within our professional liability and general
liability product lines in recent periods, partially offset by the impact of lower gross premiums within our property product lines.
Combined Ratio
The Reinsurance segment's current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2022 included $12.7 million of net losses and loss
adjustment expenses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Current accident year losses in 2021 included $100.3 million of net losses and loss
adjustment expenses attributed to the 2021 Catastrophes. Excluding these losses from the respective periods, the current accident year loss ratio in
2022 was consistent with 2021. The benefit of higher premium rates on our general liability and professional liability product lines and more
favorable premium adjustments in 2022 compared to 2021 was offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in the mix of business within the
segment and the benefit in 2021 of $21.7 million of favorable assumed reinstatement premiums on catastrophes. The change in mix of business had
an unfavorable impact as the non-renewed property business had a lower attritional loss ratio than the rest of the segment.
The Reinsurance segment's 2022 combined ratio included $26.1 million of favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was
primarily attributable to favorable development within our property product lines related to natural catastrophes and our credit and surety product
lines. Favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2022 was partially offset by additional exposures recognized on prior accident years
related to net favorable premium adjustments on our general liability, credit and surety and professional liability product lines. In 2021, the combined
ratio included $19.9 million of adverse development on prior accident years loss reserves, which was primarily attributable to net adverse
development on natural catastrophes and COVID-19 within our property product lines, as well as additional exposures recognized on prior accident
years related to net favorable premium adjustments on our professional liability product lines. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements included under Item 8 for more information on the Reinsurance segment's prior year loss reserve development.

Insurance-Linked Securities
The decrease in operating revenues and operating expenses in our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations in 2022 was primarily due to the
disposition of our Velocity and Volante managing general agent operations during the year. Operating losses in 2022 were driven by costs incurred by
Volante in connection with its launch of a Lloyd's of London syndicate prior to disposition.
Since our acquisition of Nephila in 2018, we experienced significant growth in the Velocity and Volante managing general agent operations. In 2022,
we realized the significant value created since 2018 through the sale of Velocity and Volante. We sold the majority of our controlling interest in
Velocity in February 2022 for total cash consideration of $181.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $107.3 million. Velocity provides risk origination
services for our Nephila fund management operations, as well as for third parties, and was a source of growth within our ILS operations since we
acquired Nephila in 2018. We continue to have a minority interest in Velocity after the sale, and Velocity will continue to be a source for risk
origination for our Nephila fund management operations. We sold our controlling interest in Volante in October 2022 for total cash consideration of
$181.9 million of which $155.6 million was cash. This transaction resulted in a gain of $118.5 million. Volante, which has also been a source of growth
within our ILS operations, underwrites and administers specialty insurance and reinsurance policies and provides delegated underwriting services to
third-party providers of insurance capital.
Following the sales of our Velocity and Volante managing general agent operations, our Nephila ILS operations are solely comprised of our fund
management operations. Since acquiring Nephila in 2018, investment performance in the broader ILS market has been adversely impacted by
consecutive years of elevated catastrophe losses, most recently with Hurricane Ian in 2022. These events, as well as recent volatility in the capital
markets, have impacted investor decisions around allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn has impacted our capital raises and redemptions within
the funds we manage. Additionally, increases in the cost of capital during 2022 further impacted the estimated fair value of our fund management
operations, and ultimately resulted in an $80.0 million partial impairment of goodwill in 2022. Nephila's net assets under management were $7.2
billion as of December 31, 2022. See "Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill and Intangible Assets" for further discussion of goodwill impairment at
our Nephila ILS operations.

Program Services and Other Fronting
The increase in operating revenues in our program services and other fronting operations in 2022 was primarily due to higher gross earned premium,
on which our fees are based, in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by the expansion of existing programs and growth from new programs, as well as the
growth of our other fronting arrangements. Gross written premiums in our program services operations were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross written premiums from our other fronting operations, which consist of business written by
our underwriting platform on behalf of our ILS operations, were $553.9 million and $223.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.
Markel CATCo Buy-Out
In March 2022, we completed a buy-out transaction with Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (Markel CATCo Re) and Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd. (the
Markel CATCo Funds) that provided for an accelerated return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds and resulted in the
consolidation of Markel CATCo Re upon completion of the transaction. In order to complete the transaction, we made $101.9 million in payments, net
of insurance proceeds, to or for the benefit of investors that were recognized as an expense during the first quarter of 2022. In 2022, results
attributable to Markel CATCo Re were primarily related to favorable loss reserve development on the run-off of the reinsurance contracts, all of which
were attributable to noncontrolling interest holders in Markel CATCo Re. See note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further
details regarding our Markel CATCo operations and the consolidation of Markel CATCo Re and note 21 for further details about the buy-out
transaction.
Investing Results
Our business strategy recognizes the importance of both consistent underwriting and operating profits and superior investment returns to build
shareholder value. We rely on sound underwriting practices to produce investable funds. We measure our investment performance by analyzing net
investment income earned on our investment portfolio, as well as through net investment gains, which includes unrealized gains on our equity
portfolio, and the change in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments. Our performance measures also include investment yield and
taxable equivalent total investment return. Other income or losses within our investing operations primarily relate to equity method investments in
our investing segment, which are managed separately from the rest of our investment portfolio. Based on the potential for volatility in the financial
markets, we believe investment performance is best analyzed over several years.
The following table summarizes our consolidated investment performance, which consists predominantly of the results of our Investing segment.

(1) The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments included a benefit related to an adjustment to decrease our life and annuity benefit reserves
of $56.6 million and $63.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a loss related to an adjustment to increase our life and annuity
benefit reserves of $68.2 million and $51.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no adjustment to our life and annuity benefit
reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018. See note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for details on our life and annuity
benefit reserve adjustments.
(2) Investment yield reflects net investment income as a percentage of monthly average invested assets at amortized cost.
The increase in net investment income in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher interest income on short-term investments and cash equivalents
due to higher short-term interest rates in 2022 compared to 2021. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased in 2022,
primarily attributable to higher average holdings of fixed maturity securities,
10K - 47

partially offset by a lower yield during 2022 compared to 2021. See note 4(d) of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8
for further details regarding the components of net investment income.
Net investment losses in 2022 were primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by unfavorable market value
movements in 2022. Net investment gains in 2021 were primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable
market value movements in 2021. See note 4(e) of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on the
components of net investment gains (losses).
The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments in 2022 and 2021 was attributable to decreases in the fair value of our
fixed maturity investment portfolio as a result of increases in interest rates during 2022 and 2021.
Taxable equivalent total investment return is a non-GAAP financial measure. Taxable equivalent total investment return includes items that impact
net income, such as coupon interest on fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of equity securities, dividends on equity securities and realized
investment gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, as well as changes in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities, which do
not impact net income. Certain items that are included in net investment income have been excluded from the calculation of taxable equivalent total
investment return, such as amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity portfolio, to provide a comparable basis for
measuring our investment return against industry investment returns. The calculation of taxable equivalent total investment return also includes the
current tax benefit associated with income on certain investments that is either taxed at a lower rate than the statutory income tax rate or is not fully
included in U.S. taxable income. We believe the taxable equivalent total investment return is a better reflection of the economics of our decision to
invest in certain asset classes. We focus on our long-term investment return, understanding that the level of investment gains or losses may vary
from one period to the next.
We believe our investment performance is best analyzed using taxable equivalent total investment return over several years. The following table
presents taxable equivalent total investment return before and after the effects of foreign currency movements.

Markel Ventures Results
Our Markel Ventures segment includes a diverse portfolio of businesses from different industries that offer various types of products and services to
businesses and consumers, predominantly in the United States. We measure Markel Ventures' results by its operating income and net income, as well
as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). We consolidate the results of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries on
a one-month lag, with the exception of significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period.
In December 2021, we acquired a controlling interest in Metromont LLC (Metromont), a precast concrete manufacturer and concrete building
solutions provider for commercial projects. In August 2021, we acquired a controlling interest in Buckner HeavyLift Cranes (Buckner), a provider of
crane rental services for large commercial contractors. See note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for
additional details related to these acquisitions.
The following table summarizes the operating revenues, operating income, EBITDA and net income to shareholders from our Markel Ventures
segment.
Years ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 % Change
Operating revenues $ 4,757,527 $ 3,643,827 31 %
Operating income $ 325,238 $ 272,552 19 %
EBITDA $ 506,336 $ 402,700 26 %
Net income to shareholders $ 192,601 $ 174,407 10 %
The increase in operating revenues in 2022 was driven by the contribution from Metromont, which was acquired in December 2021, as well as an
increased contribution from Buckner, which was acquired in August 2021. The combined contribution to the increase in operating revenues in 2022
attributable to these acquisitions was $604.6 million. Additionally, operating revenues in 2022 increased as a result of the impact of increased
demand and higher prices at many of our other businesses, most notably at our construction services businesses.
The benefit of increases in operating revenues to operating income, EBITDA and net income to shareholders in 2022 was reduced by increased costs
of materials and labor across many of our businesses, which reflected the impact of broader economic conditions on our operations during the year.
The higher cost of materials was due in part to a shortage in the availability of certain products, the higher cost of shipping and a prolonged period of
elevated inflation. We attempted to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through a variety of actions, such as increasing the prices of our
products and services, pre-purchasing materials, locking in prices in advance or utilizing alternative sources of materials. Our businesses have had
varying levels of success with these efforts, and we have seen conditions stabilize to varying degrees at many of our businesses. However, high labor
costs continue to impact our businesses and there can be a time lag before the impacts of changes are reflected in our margins.
The increases in operating income, EBITDA and net income to shareholders in 2022 were primarily due to the impact of higher revenues and
improved operating results at our construction services businesses, transportation-related businesses and consulting services businesses, as well as
the contribution of Metromont. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower operating margins at one of our consumer and building
products businesses in 2022 compared to 2021.
Markel Ventures EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Markel Ventures EBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with
U.S. GAAP measures, including operating income and net income to shareholders, to monitor and evaluate the performance of our Markel Ventures
segment. Because EBITDA excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, it provides an indicator of economic performance that is
useful to both management and investors in evaluating our Markel Ventures businesses as it is not affected by levels of debt, interest rates, effective
tax rates or levels of depreciation or amortization resulting from purchase accounting.

Interest Expense, Net Foreign Exchange Gains and Income Taxes
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $196.1 million in 2022 compared to $183.6 million in 2021. The increase in interest expense in 2022 was primarily attributable
to higher Markel Ventures interest expense and the issuance of our 3.45% unsecured senior notes issued in May 2021, partially offset by the impact
of the retirement of our 4.90% unsecured senior notes in July 2022. See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under
Item 8 for further details regarding the retirement of our senior long-term debt.
10K - 51

Net Foreign Exchange Gains
Net foreign exchange gains included in net income (loss) were $140.2 million in 2022 compared to $72.3 million in 2021. Net foreign exchange gains
are primarily due to the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated insurance reserves to the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Dollar strengthened
against the Euro and British Pound, the predominant foreign currencies within our insurance operations, during 2022 and 2021, particularly in the
second and third quarters of 2022. Pre-tax net foreign exchange losses attributed to changes in exchange rates on available-for-sale securities
supporting our insurance reserves, which are included in the changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments in other
comprehensive loss, were $79.5 million in 2022 compared to $78.0 million in 2021.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 32% in 2022 compared to 22% in 2021. The effective tax rate for 2022 differs from the effective tax rate for 2021, and the
statutory rate of 21%, due to the impact of various immaterial items resulting in a net tax benefit that was magnified due to the small pre-tax loss in
2022. See note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of our income taxes.
In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act). The Act implements a 15% corporate minimum tax based on adjusted
financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. We do not expect these tax law changes to have a
material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, however, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as
additional guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Shareholders and Book Value per Common Share

Other comprehensive loss to shareholders (1,094,694) (346,759)
Comprehensive income (loss) to shareholders $ (1,308,817) $ 2,078,244
Book value per common share decreased 10% from $1,036.20 at December 31, 2021 to $929.27 as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to other
comprehensive loss to shareholders in 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We seek to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and financial leverage for the protection of our policyholders, creditors and shareholders. Our
consolidated debt to capital ratio was 24% at December 31, 2022 and 23% at December 31, 2021. The increase reflects a decrease in shareholders'
equity, primarily attributable to a decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio, driven by unfavorable movements in the public equity markets
and increases in interest rates in 2022.
Holding Company
Our holding company had $3.7 billion and $5.3 billion of investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (invested
assets) at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The decrease in holding company invested assets was primarily due to capital
contributions made to our insurance subsidiaries and a decline in the fair value of the holding company investment portfolio, as well as the $350.0
million repayment of our 4.90% unsecured senior notes due July 1, 2022. See note 23 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included
under Item 8 for condensed financial information for our holding company.
10K - 52

Within our insurance subsidiaries, we seek to maintain capital that significantly exceeds required capital levels, as prescribed by applicable
regulators. A portion of the capital held by many of our insurance subsidiaries includes a portfolio of equity securities, and the unfavorable
movements in the public equity markets in 2022 had a significant impact on their investment portfolio valuations, and in turn, the capital within these
entities. In order to maintain our target levels of excess capital within the impacted insurance subsidiaries, our holding company made capital
contributions totaling $973.5 million in 2022. There were no capital contributions from our holding company to our insurance subsidiaries in 2021. We
also received dividends totaling $130.0 million from certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2022 compared to $1.0 billion in 2021.
The following table presents the composition of our holding company's invested assets.
December 31,
2022 2021
Fixed maturity securities 4 % 4 %
Equity securities 40 % 53 %
Short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 56 % 43 %
Total 100 % 100 %
After satisfying our interest and principal obligations on our senior long-term debt and notes payable to subsidiaries, as well as any other holding
company obligations, excess liquidity at Markel Corporation is available to, among other things, allocate capital to our existing businesses, complete
acquisitions, build our portfolio of equity securities or repurchase shares of our common stock.
In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $750 million of
common stock. As of December 31, 2022, $511.7 million remained available for repurchases under the program. This share repurchase program has
no expiration date but may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.
We may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or repurchase our outstanding senior notes or preferred shares, through open market purchases,
privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Those prepayments, retirements or repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions,
our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
The holding company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet debt service obligations and pay dividends on our preferred stock. Under the
insurance laws of the various states in which our domestic insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, an insurer is restricted in the amount of dividends
it may pay without prior approval of regulatory authorities. There are also regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that certain of our
foreign subsidiaries may pay based on applicable laws in their respective jurisdictions. At December 31, 2022, our domestic insurance subsidiaries
and Markel Bermuda Limited could pay ordinary dividends of $1.1 billion during the following twelve months under these laws.
We maintain a corporate revolving credit facility, which provides up to $300 million of capacity for future acquisitions, investments and stock
repurchases and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. At our discretion, up to $200 million of the total capacity may be used for
letters of credit. We may increase the capacity of the facility by up to $200 million subject to obtaining commitments for the increase and certain
other terms and conditions. This facility expires in April 2024. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under this
revolving credit facility.
We were in compliance with all covenants contained in our corporate revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022. To the extent that we are not in
compliance with our covenants, access to the revolving credit facility could be restricted. While we believe this to be unlikely, the inability to access
the revolving credit facility could adversely affect our liquidity. See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8
for further discussion of our revolving credit facility.
10K - 53

We have access to various capital sources, including dividends from certain of our subsidiaries, holding company invested assets, undrawn capacity
under our revolving credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our capital and
operating needs, including that which may be required to support the operating needs of our subsidiaries. However, the availability of these sources
of capital and the availability and terms of future financings will depend on a variety of factors. See the "Access to Capital" risk factors under Item 1A
Risk Factors for more discussion regarding our access to capital sources.
Cash Flows and Invested Assets
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion in 2022 compared to $2.3 billion in 2021. The increase in net cash flows from operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to higher net premiums within our Insurance segment, partially offset by $101.9
million of payments made in connection with the Markel CATCo buy-out transaction.
Net cash used by investing activities was $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to $2.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, net cash used by investing activities included
net purchases of fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and equity securities of $959.7 million, $846.0 million and $201.0 million,
respectively. Net cash used by investing activities was net of $630.0 million of net cash and restricted cash acquired as part of our consolidation of
Markel CATCo Re, of which $169.4 million was subsequently distributed to Markel CATCo investors for shares that were redeemed in conjunction with
the buy-out transaction. In 2021, net cash used by investing activities included net purchases of fixed maturity and equity securities of $2.5 billion
and $54.9 million, respectively, and net sales of short-term investments of $229.0 million. Net cash used by investing activities in 2021 also included
$510.9 million of net cash used for the acquisitions of Buckner and Metromont.
In 2022, as interest rates began to rise, we increased our allocation of cash to short-term investments and fixed maturity securities to support our
growing underwriting business. Additionally, we increased our purchases of equity securities in 2022 to take advantage of favorable prices following
declines in the public equity markets during the year. Cash flow from investing activities is affected by various factors such as anticipated payment of
claims, financing activity, acquisition opportunities and individual buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of our investment portfolio
management.
Invested assets were $27.4 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting a decrease of 3% in 2022. The
decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio, driven by unfavorable movements in the public equity markets and increases in interest rates in
2022, was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities. These factors were also the primary drivers of the change in the composition of
our investment portfolio. The following table presents the composition of our invested assets.
December 31,
2022 2021
Fixed maturity securities 43 % 44 %
Equity securities 28 % 32 %
Short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 29 % 24 %
Total 100 % 100 %
Net cash used by financing activities was $595.3 million in 2022, which included $350.0 million to retire our 4.90% unsecured senior notes due July 1,
2022. Financing activities in 2022 also reflected borrowings and repayments at certain our Markel Ventures businesses, primarily on revolving lines of
credit. Net cash provided by financing activities was $369.8 million in 2021, which included net proceeds of $591.4 million from our May 2021 senior
notes offering. Cash of $290.8 million and $206.5 million was used to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Cash Obligations
As of December 31, 2022, our primary cash obligations were unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, senior long-term debt and other debt and
related interest payments, life and annuity benefits and lease liabilities. These cash obligations, as presented in the following table, represent our
estimate of total future cash payments and may differ from the corresponding liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet due to present value
discounts and other adjustments required for presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table summarizes our estimated contractual
cash obligations at December 31, 2022 and the estimated amount expected to be paid in 2023.
Total cash obligations as of Cash obligations due in less
(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 than 1 year
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (1) $ 21,053,737 $ 4,494,980
Senior long-term debt and other debt (2) $ 4,148,007 $ 399,604
Interest payments on senior long-term debt and other debt (3) $ 3,414,263 $ 169,263
Life and annuity benefits (4) $ 974,212 $ 58,650
Lease liabilities (5) $ 661,112 $ 100,887
(1) The actual cash payments for settled claims will vary, possibly significantly, from these estimates. As of December 31, 2022, the average duration of our reserves for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was 3.8 years. See note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our
loss reserve estimates.
(2) See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on the scheduled maturity of principal payments on our senior long-
term debt and other debt.
(3) Interest expense is accrued in the period incurred and therefore, only a portion of the future interest payments presented in this table represents a liability on our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
(4) There is inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of payments for life and annuity benefits and actual cash payments for settled contracts could vary
significantly from these estimates. We expect $704.1 million of our cash obligation for life and annuity benefits to be paid beyond five years. See note 13 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our estimates for life and annuity benefit reserves.
(5) See note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further details on our lease obligations and the expected timing of future payments.
Various of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries maintain revolving credit facilities or lines of credit, which provide up to $620 million of aggregate
capacity for working capital and other general operational purposes. A portion of the capacity on certain of these credit facilities may be used as
security for letters of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $238.1 million and $94.3 million, respectively, of borrowings
were outstanding under these credit facilities.
As of December 31, 2022, one of our Markel Ventures subsidiaries was not in compliance with certain financial covenants of its revolving credit
facility, which had an outstanding balance of $97.9 million as of December 31, 2022. The subsidiary is working with its lenders and anticipates
amending the facility. This event is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. At
December 31, 2022, all of our other subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants contained in their respective credit facilities. To the extent our
subsidiaries are not in compliance with their respective covenants, access to their credit facilities could be restricted, which could adversely affect
their operations. See note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of our credit facilities.
Restricted Assets and Capital
At December 31, 2022, we had $4.8 billion of invested assets held in trust or on deposit for the benefit of policyholders or ceding companies or to
support underwriting activities. Additionally, we have pledged investments and cash and cash equivalents totaling $437.8 million at December 31,
2022 as security for letters of credit that have been issued by various banks on our behalf. These invested assets and the related liabilities are
included in our consolidated balance sheet. See note 4(f) of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 for further
discussion of restrictions over our invested assets.
Our insurance operations require capital to support premium writings, and we remain committed to maintaining adequate capital and surplus at each
of our insurance subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) developed a model law and risk-based capital formula
designed to help regulators identify domestic property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized. Under the NAIC's requirements, a
domestic insurer must maintain total capital and surplus above a calculated threshold or face varying levels of regulatory action. Capital adequacy of
our foreign insurance
10K - 55

subsidiaries is regulated by applicable laws of the United Kingdom, Bermuda and Germany. At December 31, 2022, the capital and surplus of each of
our insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that both are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and
require us to exercise significant judgment. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and
liabilities. These estimates, by necessity, are based on assumptions about numerous factors. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates
and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our accounts with accounting policies that involve critical accounting
estimates are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and goodwill and intangible assets.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Our consolidated balance sheets included estimated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $20.9 billion and reinsurance recoverables on
unpaid losses of $8.0 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $18.2 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Included in these
balances were unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses attributable to our program services
business and other fronting arrangements totaling $5.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $4.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Additionally, consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2022 included $347.9 million of fully
collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re, which we consolidate following the Markel CATCo buy-out. See note 17 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the consolidation of Markel CATCo Re. Our consolidated balance sheets do not include
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliates that we manage through our Nephila
insurance-linked securities operations.
We accrue liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable. We maintain reserves
for specific claims incurred and reported (case reserves) and reserves for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR reserves).
Reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process, and the corresponding reserves for reported claims are based upon all information
available to us. Case reserves consider our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting
from the claims, and may be subject to adjustment for differences between costs originally estimated and costs subsequently re-estimated or
incurred. Claims are settled based upon their merits, and some claims may take years to settle, especially if legal action is involved. As of any
balance sheet date, all claims have not yet been reported, and some claims may not be reported for many years. As a result, the liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims.
There is normally a time lag between when a loss event occurs and when it is reported to us. The actuarial methods that we use to estimate losses
have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow us to more accurately estimate
future payments. There is also often a time lag between cedents establishing case reserves or re-estimating their reserves and notifying us of those
new or revised case reserves. As a result, the reporting lag is more pronounced in our reinsurance contracts than in our insurance contracts. On
reinsurance transactions, the reporting lag will generally be 60 to 90 days after the end of a reporting period but can be longer in some cases. There
may also be a more pronounced reporting lag, as well as reliance on third-party claims handling practices and reserve estimates, on insurance
contracts for which we are not the primary insurer and participate only in excess layers of loss. Based on the experience of our actuaries and
management, we select loss development factors and trending techniques to mitigate the difficulties caused by reporting lags. At least annually, we
evaluate our loss development factors and trending assumptions using our own loss data, as well as cedent-specific and industry data, and update
them as needed.
U.S. GAAP requires that IBNR reserves be based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social
and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. IBNR reserves are
calculated by subtracting paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves from estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses.
IBNR reserves were 70% of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2022 compared to 67% at December 31, 2021.

The following table summarizes case reserves and IBNR reserves for our underwriting, program services and other fronting operations, which
excludes $347.9 million of fully collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re as of December 31, 2022. The amounts in the following table

and $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Each quarter, our actuaries prepare estimates of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on established actuarial
methods. Management reviews these estimates, supplements the actuarial analyses with information provided by claims, underwriting and other
operational personnel and determines its best estimate of loss reserves, which is recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Our procedures
for determining the adequacy of loss reserves at the end of the year are substantially similar to the procedures applied at the end of each interim
period.
Any adjustments to reserves resulting from our interim or year-end reviews, including changes in estimates, are recorded as a component of losses
and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate claims cost are referred to
as unfavorable or adverse development, or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate claims cost are
referred to as favorable development.
Program Services and Other Fronting
For our program services business and other fronting arrangements, case reserves are generally established based on reports received from the
general agents or reinsurers with whom we do business. Our actuaries review the case loss reserve data received for sufficiency, consistency with
historical data and for consistency with other programs we write that have similar characteristics. Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are
calculated using either our program experience or, where the program data is not credible, industry experience for similar products or lines of
business. Substantially all of the premium written in our program services business and other fronting arrangements is ceded, and net reserves for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $10.0 million and $11.6 million, respectively.
Underwriting
For our insurance operations, we are generally notified of insured losses by our insureds, their brokers or the primary insurer in instances in which we
participate in excess layers of insured losses on a contract. Based on this information, we establish case reserves by estimating the expected
ultimate losses from the claim (including any administrative or legal costs associated with settling the claim). Our claims personnel use their
knowledge of the policy provisions and details specific to the claim, along with information provided by internal and external experts, including
underwriters, actuaries and legal counsel, to estimate the expected ultimate losses.
For our reinsurance operations, case reserves are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies or their brokers. For
excess of loss contracts, we are typically notified of insurance losses on specific contracts and record a case reserve for the estimated expected
ultimate losses from the claim. For quota share contracts, we typically receive aggregated claims information and record a case reserve based on
that information. As with insurance business, we evaluate this information and estimate the expected ultimate losses.
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses can generally be categorized into two distinct groups, short-tail business and long-tail
business. Short-tail business refers to lines of business, such as property, accident and health,
10K - 57

automobile, watercraft and marine hull exposures, for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. Long-tail
business describes lines of business for which specific losses take much longer to emerge and may not be known and reported for some time. Given
the time frame over which long-tail exposures are ultimately settled, there is greater uncertainty and volatility in these lines than in short-tail lines of
business. Our long-tail coverages consist of most casualty lines, including professional liability, products liability, general and excess liability and
excess and umbrella exposures, as well as workers' compensation insurance, which have been a significant source growth in premium volume in
recent years. Some factors that contribute to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business, and thus require a significant degree of judgment in
the reserving process, include the effects of unanticipated levels of economic inflation, the impact of social inflation, the inherent uncertainty as to
the length of reporting and payment development patterns, the possibility of judicial interpretations or legislative changes, including changes in
workers' compensation benefit laws, that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience and the potential lack of comparability
of the underlying data used in performing loss reserve analyses.
Our ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves. Changes in our estimated ultimate liability for loss reserves generally occur as a
result of the emergence of unanticipated loss activity, the completion of specific actuarial or claims studies or changes in internal or external factors.
We closely monitor new information on reported claims and use statistical analyses prepared by our actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of our
recorded reserves. We are required to exercise considerable judgment when assessing the relative credibility of loss development trends. Our
philosophy is to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. This means that we seek to establish loss reserves that will
ultimately prove to be adequate. As a result, if new information or trends indicate an increase in frequency or severity of claims in excess of what we
initially anticipated, we generally respond quickly and increase loss reserves. If, however, frequency or severity trends are more favorable than
initially anticipated, we often wait to reduce our loss reserves until we can evaluate experience in additional periods to confirm the credibility of the
trend. In addition, for long-tail lines of business, trends develop over longer periods of time, and as a result, we give credibility to these trends more
slowly than for short-tail or less volatile lines of business.
In establishing our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, our actuaries estimate an ultimate loss ratio, by accident year or
underwriting year, for each of our product lines with input from our underwriting and claims personnel. For product lines in which loss reserves are
established on a underwriting year basis, we have developed a methodology to convert from underwriting year to accident year for financial
reporting purposes. In estimating an ultimate loss ratio for a particular line of business, our actuaries may use one or more actuarial reserving
methods and select from these a single point estimate. To varying degrees, these methods include detailed statistical analysis of past claim
reporting, settlement activity, claim frequency and severity, policyholder loss experience, industry loss experience and changes in market and
economic conditions, policy forms and exposures. The actuarial methods we use include:
Initial Expected Loss Ratio Method – This method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio. The expected loss ratio is selected
utilizing industry data, our historical data, frequency-severity and rate level forecasts and professional judgment.
Paid Loss Development – This method uses historical loss payment patterns to estimate future loss payment patterns. Our actuaries use the
historical loss patterns to develop factors that are applied to current paid loss amounts to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Incurred Loss Development – This method uses historical loss reporting patterns to estimate future loss reporting patterns. Our actuaries use
the historical loss patterns to develop factors that are applied to current reported losses to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Bornhuetter-Ferguson Paid Loss Development – This method divides the projection of ultimate losses into the portion that has already been paid
and the portion that has yet to be paid. The portion that has yet to be paid is estimated as the product of three amounts: the premium earned for the
exposure period, the expected loss ratio and the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still unpaid. The expected loss ratio is selected by
considering historical loss ratios, adjusted for any known changes in pricing, loss trends, adequacy of case reserves, changes in administrative
practices and other relevant factors.
Bornhuetter-Ferguson Incurred Loss Development – This method is identical to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss development method, except
that it uses the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still unreported, instead of the estimated percentage of ultimate losses that are still
unpaid.
10K - 58

Frequency/Severity – Under this method, expected ultimate losses are equal to the product of the expected ultimate number of claims and the
expected ultimate average cost per claim. Our actuaries use historical reporting patterns and severity patterns to develop factors that are applied to
the current reported amounts to calculate expected ultimate losses.
Other Methods – There are certain instances when traditional actuarial methods may not be appropriate for estimating unpaid losses and loss
adjustment expenses. In these instances, we may employ other actuarial methods.
Each actuarial method has its own set of assumptions and its own strengths and limitations, with no one method being better than the others in all
situations. Our actuaries select the reserving methods that they believe will produce the most reliable estimates for the class of business being
evaluated. Greater judgment may be required when we introduce new product lines or when there have been changes in claims handling practices,
as the statistical data available may be insufficient. In these instances, we may rely upon assumptions applied to similar lines of business, rely more
heavily on industry experience, take into account changes in underwriting guidelines and risk selection or review the impact of changes in claims
reserving practices with claims personnel. Greater judgment also may be required for product lines that experience a low frequency of high severity
claims, particularly when we are reliant on third party case reserve estimates and claims handling practices. In these instances, we may perform
detailed claims reviews, analyzing the characteristics of each individual claim, with input from both actuarial and claims personnel to assess the
adequacy of the case and IBNR reserves on the underlying product line. Our claims personnel use their knowledge of the specific claims along with
internal and external experts, to estimate the expected ultimate losses. While we use our best judgment in establishing our estimate for loss
reserves, applying different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different loss reserve estimates.
A key assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past development patterns will repeat themselves in the future, absent a significant change in
internal or external factors that influence the ultimate cost of our unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Our estimates reflect implicit and
explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of external factors, including economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law,
general economic conditions and recent trends in these factors. Our actuarial analyses are based on statistical analysis but also consist of reviewing
internal factors that are difficult to analyze statistically, including changes in underwriting and claims handling practices, as well as rate changes. In
the London market, and where we act as a reinsurer or participate only in excess layers of insured losses, the timing and amount of information
reported about underlying claims are in the control of third parties. This can also affect estimates and require re-estimation as new information
becomes available.
We cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as pandemics and wars, using the
traditional actuarial methods previously described. In the initial months after a catastrophic event occurs, our actuaries estimate losses and loss
adjustment expenses based on claims received to date, industry loss estimates and output from industry, broker and proprietary models, as well as
analysis of our ceded reinsurance contracts. We may also perform detailed policy and reinsurance contract level reviews. The availability of data from
these procedures varies depending on the timing of the event relative to the point at which we develop our estimate. We also consider loss
experience on historical events that may have similar characteristics to the underlying event and current market conditions, including the level of
economic inflation. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the
severity and complexity of the underlying event. As additional claims are reported and paid, and industry loss estimates are revised, we incorporate
this new information into our analysis and adjust our estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses as appropriate.
Loss reserves are established at management's best estimate, which is developed using the actuarially calculated point estimate as the starting
point. The actuarial point estimate represents our actuaries' estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the losses that
have occurred at a particular point in time; however, there is inherent uncertainty in the point estimate as it is the expected value in a range of
possible reserve estimates. In some cases, actuarial analyses, which are generally based on statistical analysis, cannot fully incorporate all of the
subjective factors that affect development of losses. In other cases, management's perspective of these more subjective factors may differ from the
actuarial perspective. Subjective factors influencing the development of management's best estimate include: the credibility and timeliness of claims
and loss information received from cedents and other third parties, economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, changes in
underwriting or claims handling practices, general economic conditions, the risk of moral hazard and other current and developing trends within the
insurance and reinsurance markets, including the effects of competition. For example, our loss experience in recent years has reflected higher than
anticipated levels of economic inflation, as well as the impacts of social inflation.
In developing its best estimate of loss reserves, management's philosophy is to establish loss reserves that are more likely to be redundant rather
than deficient, and therefore, will ultimately prove to be adequate. Management's approach to establishing
10K - 59

loss reserves typically results in loss reserves that exceed the calculated actuarial point estimate. Management also considers the range, or
variability, of reasonably possible loss outcomes determined by our actuaries when establishing its best estimate for loss reserves. The actuarial
ranges represent our actuaries' estimate of a likely lowest amount and likely highest amount that could ultimately be paid to settle the losses that
have occurred at a particular point in time. The range determinations are based on estimates and actuarial judgements and are intended to
encompass reasonably likely changes in one or more of the factors that were used to determine the point estimates. Using statistical models, our
actuaries establish a range of reasonable reserve estimates for each of our underwriting segments. Additionally, following an acquisition of insurance
operations, acquired reserves initially are recorded at fair value, and therefore our recorded loss reserves may be closer to the actuarial point
estimate until we build total loss reserves that are consistent with our historic level of confidence. Management's best estimate of net reserves for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses exceeded the actuarially calculated point estimate by $688.4 million, or 5.8%, at December 31, 2022,
compared to $638.3 million, or 6.0%, at December 31, 2021.
The difference between management's best estimate and the actuarially calculated point estimate in both 2022 and 2021 is primarily associated with
our long-tail business due to the subjective factors previously described that affect the development of losses. Certain subjective factors, particularly
the credibility and timeliness of claims information, are more pronounced within our reinsurance operations, as previously discussed, and therefore,
the percentage difference between management's best estimate and the actuarially calculated point estimate is more significant in our Reinsurance
segment than our Insurance segment.
Loss frequency and loss severity are two key measures of loss activity that often result in adjustments to actuarial assumptions relative to ultimate
loss reserve estimates. Loss frequency measures the number of claims per unit of insured exposure. When the number of newly reported claims is
higher than anticipated, generally speaking, loss reserves are increased. Conversely, loss reserves are generally decreased when fewer claims are
reported than expected. Loss severity measures the average size of a claim. When the average severity of reported claims is higher than originally
estimated, loss reserves are typically increased. When the average claim size is lower than anticipated, loss reserves are typically decreased.
Our underwriting results in 2022 included $167.4 million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to $479.8 million in 2021.
In connection with our quarterly reviews of loss reserves in 2021, the actuarial methods we used exhibited a favorable trend on prior accident years.
This trend was observed using statistical analysis of actual loss experience for prior years, particularly with regard to most of our long-tail books of
business within the Insurance segment, including our general liability and professional liability product lines. Additionally, as loss reserves are
recorded at management's best estimate, which is generally higher than the corresponding actuarially calculated point estimate, the initial reserves
established by management are more likely to be redundant than deficient. As actual losses continued to be lower than anticipated in 2021, it
became more likely that the underwriting results would prove to be better than originally estimated. Additionally, as most actuarial methods rely
upon historical reporting patterns, the favorable trends experienced on earlier accident years resulted in a re-estimation of our ultimate incurred
losses on more recent accident years. When we experience loss frequency or loss severity trends that are more favorable than we initially
anticipated, we often evaluate the loss experience over a period of several years in order to assess the relative credibility of loss development trends.
In 2021, based upon our evaluations of claims development patterns in our long-tail, and often volatile, lines of business, our actuaries reduced their
estimates of ultimate losses. Management also gave greater credibility to the favorable trends experienced on earlier accident years, and upon
incorporating these favorable trends into its best estimate, we reduced prior years loss reserves on more recent accident years accordingly.
Favorable development in 2022 was net of $70.9 million of adverse development on our professional liability and general liability product lines within
our Insurance segment, where the favorable claims and loss trends observed in 2021, and other recent years, were disrupted. Adverse development
on these product lines was primarily attributable to unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity on the 2018 and 2019
accident years within our professional liability product lines and the 2016 to 2019 accident years within our general liability product lines. The
adverse development on these accident years was across a number of products, including directors and officers, errors and omissions and
employment practices liability within professional liability and contractors and excess and umbrella within general liability. Development on prior
years loss reserves within our professional liability and general liability product lines in 2022 for these accident years was impacted by broader
market conditions, including the effects of economic and social inflation. The impacts of social inflation were most significant on our large, risk-
managed excess professional liability accounts, corresponding with a notable rise in the number of class action lawsuits on these years and the
recent unfavorable legal environment. The development of this claims trend was influenced by state and federal court closures following the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which has delayed court proceedings for claims on the impacted product lines.
10K - 60

These factors have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on these longer-tail product lines. On
our professional liability product lines, loss development reflected more favorable experience than originally anticipated on the 2020 and 2021
accident years in 2022, however, we are approaching reductions to prior year loss reserves on more recent accident years cautiously. Consistent with
our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in
excess of our previous expectations, whereas in instances where claims trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we are often
waiting to reduce loss reserves and will evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. Additionally, the actuarial methods we used
indicated a continued favorable trend in loss frequency and severity on the 2015 and prior accident years for both our professional liability and
general liability product lines. Management gave greater credibility to the favorable trend and reduced prior years loss reserves on these earlier
accident years accordingly.
Favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2022 also reflected favorable loss experience across several other product lines, most notably
our property and workers' compensation lines of business. This included favorable development on our reserves for natural catastrophes that
occurred in prior years, based on additional claims reporting and settlement activity in 2022. On our workers' compensation product line, the
actuarial methods we used indicated a continued decline in the loss severity trend on prior accident years in 2022, consistent with our experience in
recent years. As actual losses continued to be lower than anticipated in 2022, it became more likely that the underwriting results would prove to be
better than originally estimated. Management gave greater credibility to the favorable trend experienced on earlier accident years and upon
incorporating these favorable trends into its best estimate, reduced prior years loss reserves on more recent accident years accordingly. While we
believe it is likely that there will be additional favorable development on prior years loss reserves in 2023, we caution readers not to place undue
reliance on this favorable trend.
Changes in prior years loss reserves, including the trends and factors that impacted loss reserve development in 2022 and 2021, as well as further
details regarding the historical development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and changes in methodologies and assumptions
used to calculate reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are discussed in further detail in note 11 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included under Item 8.
The following table summarizes our reserves for net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and the actuarially established high and low ends of
a range of reasonable reserve estimates at December 31, 2022. This table excludes the fully collateralized reserves attributable to Markel CATCo Re.
As described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
attributable to acquisitions are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, which generally consists of the present value of the expected net loss
and loss adjustment expense payments plus a risk premium. The net loss reserves presented in this table represent our estimated future payments
for losses and loss adjustment expenses, whereas the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included on the consolidated balance
sheet include the unamortized portion of fair value adjustments recorded in conjunction with an acquisition.
Low End of High End of
Net Loss Actuarial Actuarial
(dollars in millions) Reserves Held Range(1) Range(1)
Insurance $ 9,183.7 $ 7,910.8 $ 9,883.5
Reinsurance $ 3,303.4 $ 2,642.1 $ 3,688.4
Other underwriting $ 114.7 $ 90.7 $ 162.8
(1) Due to the actuarial methods used to determine the separate ranges for each component of our business, it is not appropriate to aggregate the high or low ends of the
separate ranges to determine the high and low ends of the actuarial range on a consolidated basis.
Undue reliance should not be placed on these ranges of estimates as they are only one of many points of reference used by management to
determine its best estimate of ultimate losses. Further, actuarial ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential variability between loss reserves
estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate cost of settling claims. Similar to the development of our estimate of ultimate losses, actuarial
ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date, while ultimate paid losses are subject to events and circumstances that are
unknown as of the valuation date.
10K - 61

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we experienced favorable development on prior years loss reserves of 1% and 5%,
respectively, of beginning of year net loss reserves. The magnitude of our historical trend of favorable loss reserve development was disrupted in
2022 as a result of the emergence of multiple factors that impacted the claims and loss trends on certain of our professional liability and general
liability product lines, which resulted in net adverse loss development on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On other accident years within these long-
tail product lines, claims trends in 2022 were more favorable than we previously anticipated. Additionally, some of the loss development factors
observed in 2022 that disrupted our historical favorable trend, including the rise in class action lawsuits and delays in the court systems, are not
expected to have as significant of an impact on more recent accident years on the affected product lines. Since 2019, we've experienced meaningful
rate increases, tightened our terms and conditions, optimized our portfolio through underwriting action and risk selection, adjusted attachment
points, managed limits and diversified our portfolios. However, the impacts of economic and social inflation, among other factors previously
discussed, have also created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on our longer-tail product lines. As a
result, we are approaching reductions to prior year loss reserves on more recent accident years cautiously. It is difficult for management to predict
the duration and magnitude of a trend and, on a relative basis, it is even more difficult to predict the emergence of factors or trends that are
unknown today but may have a material impact on loss reserve development. In assessing the likelihood of whether the trends previously discussed
will continue and whether other trends may develop, we believe that a reasonably likely movement in prior years loss reserves during 2023 would
range from adverse development of 2%, or $200 million, to favorable development of 6%, or $800 million, of December 31, 2022 net loss reserves.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 included goodwill and intangible assets of $4.4 billion as follows:
December 31, 2022
(dollars in millions) Underwriting Markel Ventures Other (1) Total
Goodwill $ 894.4 $ 1,153.9 $ 590.5 $ 2,638.8
Intangible assets 362.3 796.3 588.9 1,747.5
Total $ 1,256.7 $ 1,950.2 $ 1,179.4 $ 4,386.3
(1) Amounts included in Other reflect our operations that are not included in a reportable segment, including our insurance-linked securities operations and our program
services operations.
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid to acquire a
business over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Indefinite-lived and other intangible assets are
recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of certain assets acquired, including goodwill and intangible
assets, and liabilities assumed involves significant judgment and the use of valuation models and other estimates, which require assumptions that
are inherently subjective. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $497.7 million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with
acquisitions. We did not make any significant acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022. See note 3 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements included under Item 8 for further details about recent acquisitions.
Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is required in performing impairment tests, including the optional
assessment of qualitative factors for the annual impairment test, which is used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This assessment serves as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative
impairment test.
We completed our annual tests for impairment as of October 1, 2022 based upon results of operations through September 30, 2022. We elected to
perform a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units, with the exception of our Nephila reporting unit, for which we performed a quantitative
assessment.
10K - 62

When performing our qualitative assessments, we considered macroeconomic factors such as industry conditions and market conditions. We also
considered reporting unit-specific events, actual financial performance versus expectations and management's future business expectations, as well
as the amount by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at the date of the last quantitative assessment. As part of our
qualitative assessment of recently acquired reporting units with material goodwill, we considered the fact that the businesses had been acquired in
orderly transactions between market participants, and our purchase price represented fair value at acquisition. For recent acquisitions for which we
elected to perform a qualitative assessment, there were no events since acquisition that had a significant adverse impact on the fair value of these
reporting units through the assessment date. Based on the results of our qualitative assessments, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair
value of each of the assessed reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount as of the assessment date and December 31, 2022 and none
of the assessed reporting units are at risk of a material impairment of goodwill. We considered similar factors to determine if there were any
indicators requiring an assessment of the recoverability of our definite lived intangible assets and concluded there were not. However, deterioration
of market conditions related to the general economy or the specific industries in which we operate, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated
financial performance within a reporting unit beyond that which we considered or included in our assessments, or further increases in the market-
based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, could impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill or intangible
asset impairment charges. See the risk factor titled "Impairment in the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition" within Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion of risks associated with our goodwill and
intangible assets.
We performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Nephila reporting unit, which resulted in an $80.0 million impairment of goodwill. We
acquired our Nephila operations in 2018 at which time they were recorded at fair value. The Nephila reporting unit serves as an insurance and
investment fund manager that offers a broad range of investment products, including insurance-linked securities, catastrophe bonds, insurance
swaps and weather derivatives. Nephila receives management fees for these services primarily based on the net asset value of the accounts
managed and, for certain funds, incentive fees based on their annual performance. Prior to its sale in February 2022, this reporting unit also included
our Velocity managing general agent operations.
We estimated the fair value of our Nephila reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flow
projections used in the discounted cash flow model included management's best estimate of future growth and margins. The discount rates used to
determine the fair value estimates were developed based on a capital asset pricing model using market-based inputs as well as an assessment of the
inherent risk in projected future cash flows. Our fair value estimate was negatively impacted by an increase in our discount rate assumption in 2022,
reflecting the increased cost of capital due to rising interest rates throughout 2022.
Since acquiring Nephila, investment performance in the broader ILS market has been adversely impacted by consecutive years of elevated
catastrophe losses, most recently with Hurricane Ian in 2022. These events, as well as recent volatility in the capital markets, have impacted investor
decisions around allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn has impacted our capital raises and redemptions within the funds we manage. Following
Hurricane Ian, we have seen more favorable rates on the reinsurance contracts to which the Nephila Reinsurers subscribe, which is reflective of the
current property catastrophe market and had a positive impact on Nephila's growth and performance projections. However, the impact of this
favorable trend was more than offset by the impact of further declines in investor capital within the funds we manage. Our cash flow assumptions
reflect management's best estimate of the reporting unit's future cash flows, based on information currently available, however, these assumptions
are inherently uncertain, require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change depending on the outcome of future events.
Based on the result of our quantitative assessment, the carrying value of our Nephila reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit by $80.0 million resulting in a corresponding impairment of goodwill. This reduced the goodwill of the Nephila reporting unit to $221.8
million. We also evaluated our intangible assets within the Nephila reporting unit for impairment and determined they were not impaired.

the items listed below:
• our expectations about future results of our underwriting, investing, Markel Ventures and other operations are based on current knowledge and
assume no significant man-made or natural catastrophes, no significant changes in products or personnel and no adverse changes in market
conditions;
• the effect of cyclical trends on our underwriting, investing, Markel Ventures and other operations, including demand and pricing in the insurance,
reinsurance and other markets in which we operate;
• actions by competitors, including the use of technology and innovation to simplify the customer experience, increase efficiencies, redesign
products, alter models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry, and the effect of competition on market trends
and pricing;
• our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be successful and may
increase or create new risks (e.g., insufficient demand, change to risk exposures, distribution channel conflicts, execution risk, increased
expenditures);
• the frequency and severity of man-made and natural catastrophes (including earthquakes, wildfires and weather-related catastrophes) may
exceed expectations, are unpredictable and, in the case of wildfires and weather-related catastrophes, may be exacerbated if, as many forecast,
changing conditions in the climate, oceans and atmosphere result in increased hurricane, flood, drought or other adverse weather-related
activity;
• we offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of our programs, and in other instances we are
legally required to offer terrorism insurance; in both circumstances, we actively manage our exposure, but if there is a covered terrorist attack,
we could sustain material losses;
• emerging claim and coverage issues, changing industry practices and evolving legal, judicial, social and other environmental trends or
conditions, can increase the scope of coverage, the frequency and severity of claims and the period over which claims may be reported; these
factors, as well as uncertainties in the loss estimation process, can adversely impact the adequacy of our loss reserves and our allowance for
reinsurance recoverables;
• reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves, primarily because of reliance upon the original underwriting
decisions made by ceding companies and the longer lapse of time from the occurrence of loss events to their reporting to the reinsurer for
ultimate resolution;
• inaccuracies (whether due to data error, human error or otherwise) in the various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios,
predictive and stochastic modeling, and forecasting) we use to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our
insurance and insurance-linked securities businesses could cause us to misprice our products or fail to appropriately estimate the risks to which
we are exposed;
• changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book (which is in runoff), for
example, changes in assumptions and estimates of mortality, longevity, morbidity and interest rates, could result in material changes in our
estimated loss reserves for such business;
• adverse developments in insurance coverage litigation or other legal or administrative proceedings could result in material increases in our
estimates of loss reserves;
• initial estimates for catastrophe losses and other significant, infrequent events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict),
are often based on limited information, are dependent on broad assumptions about the nature and extent of losses, coverage, liability and
reinsurance, and those losses may ultimately differ materially from our expectations;
• changes in the availability, costs, quality and providers of reinsurance coverage, which may impact our ability to write or continue to write certain
lines of business or to mitigate the volatility of losses on our results of operations and financial condition;
• the ability or willingness of reinsurers to pay balances due may be adversely affected by industry and economic conditions, deterioration in
reinsurer credit quality and coverage disputes, and collateral we hold, if any, may not be sufficient to cover a reinsurer's obligation to us;
• after the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts, any subsequent adverse development in the re-assumed loss reserves will result in a
charge to earnings;

• regulatory actions can impede our ability to charge adequate rates and efficiently allocate capital;
• general economic and market conditions and industry specific conditions, including extended economic recessions or expansions; prolonged
periods of slow economic growth; inflation or deflation; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices and interest
rates; volatility in the credit and capital markets; and other factors;
• economic conditions, actual or potential defaults in corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities or sovereign debt obligations,
volatility in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of concentrated investments can have a significant impact
on the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and equity securities, as well as the carrying value of our other assets and liabilities, and this
impact may be heightened by market volatility and our ability to mitigate our sensitivity to these changing conditions;
• economic conditions may adversely affect our access to capital and credit markets;
• the effects of government intervention, including material changes in the monetary policies of central banks, to address financial downturns
(such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), inflation and other economic and currency concerns;

and the markets they serve or that any disruptions in regional or worldwide economic conditions generally arising from these situations may have
on our businesses, industries or investments;
• the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption caused by health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its
variants, as well as governmental, legislative, judicial or regulatory actions or developments in response thereto;
• changes in U.S. tax laws, regulations or interpretations, or in the tax laws, regulations or interpretations of other jurisdictions in which we
operate, and adjustments we may make in our operations or tax strategies in response to those changes;
• a failure or security breach of, or cyberattack on, enterprise information technology systems that we use or a failure to comply with data
protection or privacy regulations;
• third-party providers may perform poorly, breach their obligations to us or expose us to enhanced risks;

• we may not realize the contemplated benefits, including cost savings and synergies, of our acquisitions;
• any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets;
• the failure or inadequacy of any methods we employ to manage our loss exposures;
• the loss of services of any senior executive or other key personnel of our businesses could adversely impact one or more of our operations;

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in
equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our consolidated balance sheets include assets and liabilities
with estimated fair values that are subject to market risk. Our primary market risks are equity price risk associated with investments in equity
securities, interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our
international operations.
Our fixed maturity securities and equity securities are recorded at fair value, which is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets, if
available. We determine fair value for these investments after considering various sources of information, including information provided by a third-
party pricing service. The pricing service provides prices for substantially all of our fixed maturity securities and equity securities. In determining fair
value, we generally do not adjust the prices obtained from the pricing service. We obtain an understanding of the pricing service's valuation
methodologies and related inputs, which include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids, offers, duration,
credit ratings, estimated cash flows and prepayment speeds. We validate prices provided by the pricing service by reviewing prices from other
pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances.
Equity Price Risk
We invest a portion of shareholder funds in equity securities, which have historically produced higher long-term returns relative to fixed maturity
securities. We seek to invest in profitable companies, with honest and talented management, that exhibit reinvestment opportunities and capital
discipline, at reasonable prices. We intend to hold these investments over the long term and focus on long-term total investment return,
understanding that gains or losses on investments may fluctuate from one period to the next. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are
recognized in net income.
At December 31, 2022, our equity portfolio was concentrated in terms of the number of issuers and industries. Such concentrations can lead to
higher levels of volatility. At December 31, 2022, our ten largest equity holdings represented $3.2 billion, or 42%, of the equity portfolio. Investments
in the property and casualty insurance industry represented $1.5 billion, or 19%, of our equity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and included a $997.7
million investment in the common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a company whose subsidiaries engage in a number of diverse business activities
in addition to insurance. We have investment guidelines that set limits on the equity holdings of our insurance subsidiaries.
The following table summarizes our equity price risk and shows the effect of a hypothetical 35% increase or decrease in market prices as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021. The selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios.

As of December 31, 2021
Equity securities $ 9,024 35% increase $ 12,182 17.0 %
35% decrease 5,866 (17.0)
Interest Rate Risk
Our fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Increases and decreases in interest rates typically result in decreases
and increases, respectively, in the fair value of these financial instruments. Our fixed maturity investments are recorded at estimated fair value in our
financial statements, and therefore, changes in interest rates impact our financial position and results of operations. Our borrowings are recorded at
amortized cost in our financial statements, and therefore, changes in fair value do not impact our financial position or results of operations.
10K - 67

The majority of our investable assets come from premiums paid by policyholders. These funds are invested predominantly in high-quality government
and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities that generally match the duration and currency of our loss reserves. As of December 31, 2022,
our fixed maturity portfolio had an average duration of 3.9 years and an average rating of "AAA." See note 4(c) of the notes to consolidated financial
statements included under Item 8 for details regarding contractual maturity dates of our fixed maturity portfolio. The changes in the estimated fair
value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
We typically hold these fixed maturity investments until maturity, and as a result, unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are
generally expected to reverse as the securities mature.
We work to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our fixed maturity portfolio. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is
managed with consideration given to the estimated duration of our liabilities. We have investment guidelines that limit the maximum duration and
maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio.
We use a commercially available model to estimate the effect of interest rate risk on the fair values of our fixed maturity portfolio and borrowings.
The model estimates the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors including duration, prepayment, put options and call options. Fair
values are estimated based on the present value of cash flows, using a representative set of possible future interest rate scenarios. The model
requires that numerous assumptions be made about the future. To the extent that any of the assumptions are invalid, incorrect estimates could
result. The usefulness of a single point-in-time model is limited, as it is unable to accurately incorporate the full complexity of market interactions.
The following table summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2022 and
2021. The selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We have foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our international operations' assets and liabilities. We manage this risk
primarily by matching assets and liabilities that are subject to foreign exchange rate risk as closely as possible. To assist with this matching, we
periodically purchase foreign currency forward contracts and purchase or sell foreign currencies in the open market. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses on our forward contracts are recorded in earnings. Our forward contracts generally have maturities of three months.
At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, 90% of our invested assets were denominated in United States (U.S.) Dollars. At December 31, 2022 and
2021, 89% and 86%, respectively, of our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and life and annuity benefits were denominated in
U.S. Dollars. At those dates, the largest foreign currency denominated balances within both our invested assets and reserves for unpaid losses and
loss adjustment expenses and life and annuity benefits were the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk were
substantially matched or hedged.
Credit Risk
Credit risk, which is not considered a market risk, is the risk that an entity becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligation to us. Our primary
credit risks are the credit risk within our fixed maturity portfolio and the credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables within our underwriting,
program services and other fronting operations.
Fixed Maturity Investments
Credit risk exists within our fixed maturity portfolio from the potential for loss resulting from adverse changes in an issuer's ability to repay its debt
obligations. We monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that credit risk does not exceed prudent levels. We have consistently invested in high
credit quality, investment grade securities. As of December 31, 2022, our fixed maturity portfolio had an average rating of "AAA," with 99% rated "A"
or better by at least one nationally recognized rating organization. Our policy is to invest in investment grade securities and to minimize investments
in fixed maturity securities that are unrated or rated below investment grade. Our fixed maturity portfolio includes securities issued with financial
guaranty insurance. We purchase fixed maturity securities based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying assets without regard to
insurance.
Our fixed maturity portfolio includes securities issued by foreign governments and non-sovereign foreign institutions. General concern exists about
foreign countries that experience financial difficulties during periods of adverse economic conditions. We monitor developments in foreign countries,
currencies and issuers that could pose risks to our fixed maturity portfolio, including ratings downgrades, political and financial changes and the
widening of credit spreads. Our fixed maturity portfolio is highly diversified and comprised of high quality securities.
We obtain information from news services, data providers, rating agencies and various financial market participants to assess potential negative
impacts on a country or company's financial risk profile. We analyze concentrations within our fixed maturity portfolio by country, currency and
issuer, which allows us to assess our level of diversification with respect to these exposures, reduce troubled exposures should they occur and
mitigate any future financial distress that these exposures could cause.
Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes securities issued by municipalities. General concern exists about municipalities that experience financial
difficulties during periods of adverse economic conditions. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our municipal bond portfolio by investing in high
quality securities and by diversifying our holdings, which are typically either general obligation or revenue bonds related to essential products and
services.

Reinsurance Recoverables
We have credit risk to the extent any of our reinsurers are unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our ceded reinsurance agreements. We
monitor changes in the financial condition of each of our reinsurers, and we assess our concentration of credit risk on a regular basis. While we
believe our net reinsurance recoverable balances are collectible, deterioration in reinsurers' ability to pay, or collection disputes, could adversely
affect our operating cash flows, financial position and results of operations. See note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included
under Item 8 for additional details about our reinsurance recoverables and exposures.
Underwriting
Within our underwriting operations, our reinsurance recoverables balance for the ten largest reinsurers was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022,
representing 62% of the $3.1 billion total reinsurance recoverables, before considering allowances for credit losses. Eight of our ten largest reinsurers
within our underwriting operations were rated "A" or better by A.M. Best Company (Best). As of December 31, 2022, for both of the remaining
reinsurers, which are related parties, collateral held exceeded the related reinsurance recoverable. We were the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust
accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $930.9 million at December 31, 2022, collateralizing reinsurance recoverable balances due
from these ten reinsurers.
Within our underwriting operations, we attempt to minimize credit exposure to reinsurers through adherence to internal reinsurance guidelines. To
participate in our reinsurance program, prospective companies generally must: (i) maintain a Best or Standard & Poor's rating of "A" (excellent) or
better; (ii) maintain minimum capital and surplus of $750 million; and (iii) provide collateral for recoverables in excess of an individually established
amount. We also consider qualitative factors when evaluating reinsurers for eligibility to participate in our reinsurance program. In addition, certain
foreign reinsurers for our U.S. insurance operations must provide collateral equal to 100% of recoverables, with the exception of reinsurers who have
been granted certified or authorized status by an insurance company's state of domicile. Our credit exposure to Lloyd's of London syndicates is
managed through individual and aggregate exposure thresholds.
Program Services
Within our program services business, our reinsurance recoverables balance for the ten largest reinsurers was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2022,
representing 67% of the $4.9 billion total reinsurance recoverables, before considering allowances for credit losses. We were the beneficiary of letters
of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022, collateralizing reinsurance recoverable
balances due from these ten reinsurers, and $3.3 billion for our total reinsurance recoverables balance. Five of our ten largest reinsurers were rated
"A" or better by Best. For each of the remaining five reinsurers, as of December 31, 2022, collateral held exceeded the related reinsurance
recoverable.
Within our program services business, we mitigate credit risk by either selecting well capitalized, highly rated authorized reinsurers or requiring that
the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks, which, in some instances, exceeds the related reinsurance recoverable. For
reinsurers with a credit rating of lower than "A" we employ a stringent collateral monitoring program, under which the majority of the reinsurance
recoverable balances is fully collateralized. These collateral requirements are regularly monitored by a credit committee within our program services
operations.
Other Fronting
For our other fronting arrangements, which are written on behalf of our ILS operations, our total reinsurance recoverables balance was $479.7 million
at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our ILS operations held investor collateral in excess of the related reinsurance recoverables. For
this business, we require collateral up to a specified level of annual aggregate agreement year losses, which is held in a trust for which we are the
beneficiary. The required collateral is monitored regularly against the annual aggregate agreement year losses to ensure adequacy of the
reinsurance recoverable in the event of a loss.

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Markel Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Markel Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical
audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Estimation of the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the Company's underwriting
operations
As described in Note 11, the Company has recorded a liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (loss reserves) of $20.9 billion
as of December 31, 2022. Of this amount, $15.4 billion represents loss reserves for the Company's underwriting operations. The Company's
actuaries use established actuarial methods and past development patterns to estimate ultimate losses to be paid. For its underwriting
operations, loss reserves are established at the Company's best estimates, which incorporate the actuarial point estimates and are adjusted
for certain subjective factors.
10K - 71

We identified the assessment of loss reserve estimation for the Company's underwriting operations as a critical audit matter because it
involved significant measurement uncertainty. The assessment of actuarial methods and key assumptions used to estimate ultimate losses
required specialized actuarial skills and subjective auditor judgment. Key assumptions included weighting of actuarial methods, expected loss
ratios, and patterns and variability of loss development.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. With the assistance of actuarial professionals, as
appropriate, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's loss reserving process
for its underwriting operations. This included controls over key assumptions and the determination of loss reserves. Additionally, we also
involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
• assessing the Company's actuarial methodologies by comparing to generally accepted actuarial methodologies and evaluating the
weighting of the methods based on common industry practice
• developing independent actuarial estimates for certain product lines using the Company's underlying historical claims and policy data, as
well as industry loss reporting and payment data for certain lines
• for certain product lines, assessing the Company's assumptions about future claims reporting and payments for consistency with historical
loss development and payment patterns
• developing an independent range of consolidated loss reserves based on actuarial methods and assumptions, comparing those results to
the Company's recorded reserves and evaluating the movement of the Company's recorded reserve within our range

MARKEL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Markel Corporation is a diverse financial holding company serving a variety of niche markets. Markel Corporation's principal business markets and
underwrites specialty insurance products. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Markel Ventures, Inc. (Markel Ventures), Markel Corporation also
owns controlling interests in various businesses that operate outside of the specialty insurance marketplace. See note 2 for details regarding
reportable segments.
a) Basis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.)
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of Markel Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as any
variable interest entities (VIEs) that meet the requirements for consolidation (the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates the results of its Markel Ventures subsidiaries on a one-month lag, with the
exception of significant transactions or events that occur during the intervening period. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation.
b) Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management periodically reviews its estimates and assumptions. Quarterly reviews include evaluating the adequacy of reserves for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions for goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed in conjunction with an
acquisition, and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reassessed at least annually for impairment. Actual results may differ materially
from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
c) Investments. Available-for-sale investments and equity securities are recorded at estimated fair value. Available-for-sale investments include
fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. Fixed maturity securities include government and municipal bonds and mortgage-backed
securities with original maturities of more than one year. Short-term investments include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, discount notes
and treasury bills with original maturities of one year or less. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of income taxes, are
included in other comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, net of income taxes, are included in net income as net
investment gains or losses. The Company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess declines in the fair value of its available-for-sale
investments. Any impairment losses on the Company's available-for-sale investments are recorded as an allowance, subject to reversal.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the lives of the related fixed maturity securities as an adjustment to the yield using the
effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from both the
estimated fair value and the amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities and included within other assets on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets. Any uncollectible accrued interest receivable is written off in the period it is deemed uncollectible. Realized investment gains or
losses on available-for-sale investments are included in net income. Realized gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale investments are derived
using the first-in, first-out method on the trade date.
See note 4 and note 5 for further details regarding the Company's investment portfolio.
d) Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The
carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
e) Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use are recorded as restricted cash
and cash equivalents. The carrying value of the Company's restricted cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
f) Receivables. Receivables include amounts receivable from agents, brokers and insureds, which represent premiums that are both currently due
and amounts not yet due on insurance and reinsurance policies. Premiums for insurance policies are generally due at inception. Premiums for
reinsurance policies generally become due over the period of coverage based on the policy terms. Changes in the estimate of reinsurance premiums
written will result in an adjustment to premiums receivable in
10K - 77

the period they are determined. Receivables also include amounts receivable from contracts with customers, which represent the Company's
unconditional right to consideration for satisfying the performance obligations outlined in the contract.
The Company monitors credit risk associated with receivables, taking into consideration the fact that in certain instances in the Company's insurance
operations credit risk may be reduced by the Company's right to offset loss obligations or unearned premiums against premiums receivable. An
allowance is established for credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the receivable, which is recorded net of this allowance. The
allowance is charged to net income in the period the receivable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company's
estimate of expected credit losses. See note 7 for further details regarding receivables.
g) Reinsurance Recoverables. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with
the reinsured business. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk to minimize its
exposure to significant losses from individual reinsurers. To further reduce credit exposure on reinsurance recoverables, the Company has received
collateral, including letters of credit and trust accounts, from certain reinsurers. Cash collateral related to these reinsurance agreements is available,
without restriction, when the Company pays losses covered by the reinsurance agreements. An allowance is established for credit losses expected to
be incurred over the life of the reinsurance recoverable, which is recorded net of this allowance. The allowance is charged to net income in the period
the recoverable is recorded and revised in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the Company's estimate of expected credit losses. As of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for credit losses associated with the Company's reinsurance recoverables was not material to the
consolidated financial statements.
h) Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. Costs directly related to the acquisition of insurance premiums are deferred and amortized over the related
policy period, generally one year. The Company only defers acquisition costs incurred that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or
renewal insurance contracts, including commissions to agents and brokers, salaries and benefits and premium taxes. Commissions received related
to reinsurance premiums ceded are netted against broker commissions in determining acquisition costs eligible for deferral. To the extent that future
policy revenues on existing policies are not adequate to cover related costs and expenses, deferred policy acquisition costs are charged to earnings.
The Company does not consider anticipated investment income in determining whether a premium deficiency exists. See note 2(a) and (f) for further
details regarding policy acquisition costs, as well as note 24 for details regarding a change to the Company's policy for accounting for deferred policy
acquisition costs.
i) Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess
of the amount paid to acquire a business over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Indefinite-lived
and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of certain assets acquired and
liabilities assumed involves significant judgment and the use of valuation models and other estimates, which require assumptions that are inherently
subjective. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. The Company completes an annual test during
the fourth quarter of each year based upon the results of operations through September 30. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally five to 20 years, and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. See note 8 for further details regarding goodwill and intangible assets.
j) Equity Method Investments. The Company holds certain investments that are required to be accounted for under the equity method, whereby
they initially are recorded at cost within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently increased or decreased by the Company's
proportionate share of the net income or loss of the investee and other transactions impacting the investee's equity. The Company records its
proportionate share of net income or loss of the investee in services and other revenues. The Company records its proportionate share of other
comprehensive income or loss of the investee as a component of other comprehensive income. Dividends or other equity distributions in excess of
the Company's cumulative equity in earnings of the investee are recorded as a reduction of the investment. The Company reviews equity method
investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other-
than-temporary. See note 6 for further details regarding the Company's equity method investments.
k) Property and Equipment. Property and equipment is maintained primarily by certain of the Company's Markel Ventures businesses and is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
10K - 78

l) Leases. The present value of future lease payments for the Company's leases with terms greater than 12 months is included on the consolidated
balance sheets as lease liabilities and right-of-use lease assets.
The Company's lease portfolio primarily consists of operating leases for real estate. Total expected lease payments are based on the lease payments
specified in the contract and the stated term, including any options to extend or terminate that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The
Company accounts for lease components and any associated non-lease components within a contract as a single lease component, and therefore
allocates all of the expected lease payments to the lease component.
The lease liability, which represents the Company's contractual obligation to make lease payments, is calculated based on the present value of
expected lease payments over the remaining lease term, discounted using the Company's collateralized incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date. The lease liability is then adjusted for any prepaid rent, lease incentives received or capitalized initial direct costs to determine
the lease asset, which represents the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities and lease assets are included in
other liabilities and other assets, respectively, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Total lease costs are primarily comprised of rental expense for operating leases, which is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Rental expense attributable to the Company's underwriting operations is included in underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses and rental
expense attributable to the Company's other operations is included in products expenses and services and other expenses in the consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income. See note 9 for further details regarding leases.
m) Inventories. Inventories are maintained at certain of the Company's Markel Ventures businesses and consist primarily of raw materials, work-in-
process and finished goods. Inventories are generally valued using the first-in-first-out method and stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Inventories were $639.6 million and $529.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in other assets on the
Company's consolidated balance sheets.
n) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. The Company owns controlling interests in various companies through its Markel Ventures operations.
In some cases, the Company has the option to acquire the remaining equity interests, and the remaining equity interests have the option to sell their
interests to the Company, in the future. The redemption value of the remaining equity interests is generally based on the respective company's
earnings in specified periods preceding the redemption date. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are currently redeemable or become
redeemable between 2023 and 2032.
The Company recognizes changes in the redemption value that exceed the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests to retained
earnings as if the balance sheet date was also the redemption date. Changes in the redemption value also result in an adjustment to net income to
common shareholders in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share. See note 19 for further details regarding the calculation
of basic and diluted net income per common share.
o) Income Taxes. The Company records deferred income taxes to reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when management believes it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax positions
that meet the more likely than not threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach, whereby the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See note 15 for further details regarding income taxes.
p) Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on the Company's property and casualty
insurance business are based on evaluations of reported claims and estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported.
Estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported are based on reserve development studies, among other things.
Recorded reserves are estimates, and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimates. See note 11 for further details regarding
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.
q) Life and Annuity Benefits. The Company has a run-off block of life and annuity reinsurance contracts that subject the Company to mortality,
longevity and morbidity risks. The assumptions used to determine policy benefit reserves are generally
10K - 79

locked-in for the life of the contract unless an unlocking event occurs. To the extent existing policy reserves, together with the present value of future
gross premiums and expected investment income earned thereon, are not adequate to cover the present value of future benefits, settlement and
maintenance costs, the locked-in assumptions are revised to current best estimate assumptions and a charge to earnings for life and annuity benefits
is recognized at that time. Because of the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for life and annuity benefit obligations and the
long-term nature of these reinsurance contracts, the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimates. Results attributable to the run-off of
life and annuity reinsurance contracts are included in services and other revenues and services and other expenses in the Company's consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income. Investment income earned on the investments that support the policy benefit reserves are
included in net investment income. See note 13 for further details regarding life and annuity benefits and note 1(x) for information on changes to the
accounting for life and annuity benefits beginning in 2023.
r) Revenue Recognition.
Property and Casualty Premiums
Insurance premiums written are generally recorded at the inception of a policy and earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period, typically one
year. The cost of reinsurance ceded is initially recorded as prepaid reinsurance premiums and is amortized over the reinsurance contract period in
proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. Premiums ceded are netted against premiums written. For multi-year contracts where
insurance premiums are payable in annual installments, written premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on management's best
estimate of total premiums to be received. For contracts where the cedent has the ability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term
of the policy, premiums are generally recorded on an annual basis or up to the contract cancellation point. The remaining premiums are estimated
and included as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.
Assumed reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms and information received from cedents
and brokers and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period, or for multi-year contracts, in proportion with the underlying risk exposure
to the extent there is variability in the exposure through the coverage period. Changes in reinsurance premium estimates are expected and may
result in significant adjustments in any period. These estimates change over time as additional information regarding changes in underlying
exposures is obtained. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded as premiums written in the period they are determined
and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period, or immediately if the coverage period has ended. The Company uses the periodic
method to account for assumed reinsurance from foreign reinsurers as a result of the sufficiency of the information provided by the reinsurer, which
is consistent with its accounting for assumed reinsurance from U.S. reinsurers.
Certain contracts that the Company writes provide for reinstatement of coverage. Reinstatement premiums are the premiums for the restoration of
the insurance or reinsurance limit of a contract to its full amount after a loss occurrence by the insured or reinsured. The Company accrues for
reinstatement premiums resulting from losses recorded. Such accruals are based upon contractual terms and management judgment is involved with
respect to the amount of losses recorded. Changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with reinstatement premium features will result in
changes in reinstatement premiums based on contractual terms. Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time losses are recorded and are
generally earned on a pro rata basis over the remaining coverage period.
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily relate to the Company's Markel Ventures, insurance-linked securities (ILS) and program services operations and consist of
revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenues are recognized when, or as, control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the
Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
Contracts with customers generally have an original term of one year or less. For contracts with customers that have an original term greater than
one year, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount for which it has a right to invoice for the products delivered or services performed. Certain
customers may receive volume rebates or credits for products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company
estimates these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to the customer and reduces revenues recognized by a corresponding
amount. The Company does not expect significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration over the term of the contracts.
Payment terms for products and services vary by the type of product or service offered and the location of the customer, and payment is typically
received at or shortly after the point of sale. For certain products, the Company requires partial payment
10K - 80

in the form of a deposit before the products are delivered to the customer, which is included in other liabilities on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets.
Through its Markel Ventures operations, the Company has several different businesses that manufacture or produce a variety of products, including
ornamental plants, precast concrete, equipment used in baking systems, over-the-road transportation equipment, portable dredges, residential
homes and flooring for the trucking industry. Most of the Company's product revenues are recognized when the products are shipped to the customer
or the products arrive at the agreed upon destination with the end customer. Some of the Company's contracts include multiple performance
obligations. For such arrangements, revenues are allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price, which is
derived from amounts stated in the contract.
Through its Markel Ventures operations, the Company also has several different businesses that provide various types of services, including
distribution of exterior building products, fire protection and life safety services and consulting services. Service revenues are generally recognized
over the term of the contracts based on hours incurred or as services are provided.
The Company's other revenues also include investment management fee income and through 2022, managing general agent (MGA) commissions for
services provided through the Company's ILS operations. Investment management fee income is recognized over the period in which investment
management services are provided and is calculated and recognized monthly, typically based on the net asset value of the accounts managed. For
certain accounts, the Company is also entitled to participate, on a fixed-percentage basis, in any net income generated in excess of an agreed-upon
threshold as established by the underlying investment management agreements. In general, net income is calculated at the end of each calendar
year and incentive fees are payable annually. Incentive fee income is recognized at the conclusion of the contractual performance period, when the
uncertainty related to performance has been resolved. MGA commissions are based on the direct written premiums of the insurance contracts
placed. Commissions received for these services are generally recognized when the related policy is written.
Program services fees, or ceding fees, received in exchange for providing access to the U.S. property and casualty insurance market are based on the
gross premiums written on behalf of general agent and capacity provider clients. Ceding fees are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition
of the gross premiums earned on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies reinsured.
See note 10 for further details regarding products, services and other revenues.
s) Program Services. In connection with its program services business, the Company enters into contractual agreements with both producing
general agents and reinsurers, whereby the general agents and reinsurers are typically obligated to each other for payment of insurance amounts,
including premiums, commissions and losses. To the extent these funds are not the obligation of the Company and are settled directly between the
general agent and the reinsurer, no receivables or payables are recorded for these amounts. All obligations of the Company's insurance subsidiaries
owed to or on behalf of their policyholders are recorded by the Company and, to the extent appropriate, offsetting reinsurance recoverables are
recorded.
t) Foreign Currency Transactions. The U.S. Dollar is the Company's reporting currency and the primary functional currency of its foreign
underwriting operations. The functional currencies of the Company's other foreign operations are the currencies of the primary economic
environments in which the majority of their business is transacted.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are the result of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency at each foreign entity. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at current exchange rates, with
resulting gains and losses included in net foreign exchange gains within net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the
functional currency at historic exchange rates. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with resulting gains and losses, including the
portion attributable to movements in exchange rates, included in the change in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale investments, net of taxes
within other comprehensive income. While the Company attempts to naturally hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching assets
and liabilities in the same currencies, there is a financial statement mismatch between the gains or losses recorded in net income related to
insurance reserves denominated in non-functional currencies and the gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income related to the
available-for-sale securities held in non-functional currencies supporting the reserves.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations denominated in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into the U.S. Dollar at
current exchange rates, with resulting gains or losses included, net of taxes, in the change in foreign
10K - 81

currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income. See note 20 for further details regarding the components of other
comprehensive income.
u) Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income represents all changes in equity that result from recognized transactions and other economic
events during the period. Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are included in
comprehensive income but excluded from net income, such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments, foreign currency
translation adjustments and changes in net actuarial pension loss. See note 20 for further details regarding other comprehensive income.
v) Net Income Per Common Share. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing adjusted net income to shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing adjusted
net income to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year.
See note 19 for further details regarding the calculation of basic and diluted net income per common share.
w) Variable Interest Entities. The Company determines whether it has relationships with entities defined as VIEs in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, Consolidation. Under this guidance, a VIE is consolidated by the
variable interest holder that is determined to be the primary beneficiary.
An entity in which the Company holds a variable interest is a VIE if any of the following conditions exist: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not
sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) as a group, the holders of equity
investment at risk lack either the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity's activities that
most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or the obligation to absorb the expected losses or right to receive the expected residual
returns, or (c) the voting rights of some investors are disproportionate to their obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to
receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or both and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of
an investor with disproportionately few voting rights.
The primary beneficiary is defined as the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest as a result of having
both (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb
losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The Company determines whether an entity is a VIE at the inception of its variable interest in the entity and upon the occurrence of certain
reconsideration events. The Company continually reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which it holds a variable interest. See
note 17 for further details regarding the Company's involvement with VIEs.
x) Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-12, Financial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements
to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. The FASB subsequently issued several ASUs as amendments to ASU No. 2018-12. The standard
requires insurance companies with long duration contracts to: (1) review and, if there is a change, update the assumptions used to measure expected
cash flows at least annually; (2) update the discount rate assumption at each reporting date; and (3) enhance certain qualitative and quantitative
disclosures. ASU No. 2018-12 becomes effective for the Company during the first quarter of 2023 and will be applied using a modified retrospective
approach that requires restatement of prior periods presented, including a cumulative adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income as of
January 1, 2021 (the transition date). The standard will, among other things, impact the discount rate used in estimating reserves for the Company's
life and annuity reinsurance portfolio, which is in runoff. Currently, the discount rate assumption is locked-in for the life of the contracts, unless there
is a loss recognition event. The adoption of ASU 2018-12 will result in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $15.3 million, net of
taxes, as a result of changing the discount rate assumption as of January 1, 2021. However, the cumulative impact of changes in the discount rate
assumption through the January 1, 2023 adoption date is based on the discount rate assumption determined as of the adoption date. Based on
increases in interest rates between the transition date and the adoption date, the cumulative increase to accumulated other comprehensive income
as of January 1, 2023 will be $89.6 million, net of taxes.
10K - 82

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from
Contracts with Customers, which becomes effective for the Company during the first quarter of 2023. ASU No. 2021-08 requires contract assets and
liabilities accounted for under FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to be recorded at the acquisition date as if the acquirer
entered into those contracts itself on the contract inception dates, rather than at fair value. At adoption, ASU No. 2021-08 will not impact the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but prospectively, this ASU will impact amounts recorded by the Company for assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with certain acquisitions.
2. Segment Reporting Disclosures
The chief operating decision maker reviews the Company's ongoing underwriting operations on a global basis in the following two segments:
Insurance and Reinsurance. In determining how to allocate resources and assess the performance of the Company's underwriting results,
management considers many factors, including the nature of the insurance product sold, the type of account written and the type of customer
served. The Insurance segment includes all direct business and facultative placements written on a risk-bearing basis within the Company's
underwriting operations. The Reinsurance segment includes all treaty reinsurance written on a risk-bearing basis within the Company's underwriting
operations. All investing activities related to the Company's insurance operations are included in the Investing segment.
The chief operating decision maker reviews and assesses Markel Ventures' performance in the aggregate, as a single operating segment. The Markel
Ventures segment primarily consists of controlling interests in a diverse portfolio of businesses that operate in various industries.
The Company's other operations primarily consist of the results of the Company's insurance-linked securities operations and program services
business. Other operations also include results for lines of business discontinued prior to, or in conjunction with, acquisitions, including development
on asbestos and environmental loss reserves and results attributable to the run-off of life and annuity reinsurance business, which are monitored
separately from the Company's ongoing underwriting operations. For purposes of segment reporting, none of these other operations are considered
to be reportable segments.
Segment profit for each of the Company's underwriting segments is measured by underwriting profit. The property and casualty insurance industry
commonly defines underwriting profit as earned premiums net of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting, acquisition and insurance
expenses. Underwriting profit does not replace operating income or net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of profitability.
Underwriting profit or loss provides a basis for management to evaluate the Company's underwriting performance. Segment profit for the Company's
underwriting segments may also include other revenues and expenses that are attributable to the Company's underwriting operations that are not
captured in underwriting profit. Segment profit for the Investing segment is measured by income from the Company's investment portfolio, which is
comprised of net investment income and net investment gains. Segment profit for the Investing segment also includes income from equity method
investments, which is included within services and other revenues. Segment profit for the Markel Ventures segment is measured by operating
income.
For management reporting purposes, the Company allocates assets to its underwriting operations and to its Investing and Markel Ventures segments
and certain of its other operations, including its insurance-linked securities and program services operations. Underwriting assets include assets
attributed to the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments, discontinued underwriting lines of business, as well as assets that are not
specifically allocated to the Company's other operations. Generally, the Company manages its underwriting assets in the aggregate and therefore
does not allocate assets to individual underwriting segments.

3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
Volante
In October 2022, the Company sold its controlling interest in its Volante managing general agent companies (Volante) for total consideration of
$181.9 million, of which $155.6 million was cash. This transaction resulted in a gain of $118.5 million that was included in services and other
revenue. Volante underwrites and administers specialty insurance and reinsurance policies and provides delegated underwriting services to third-
party providers of insurance capital.
Velocity
In February 2022, the Company sold the majority of its controlling interest in its Velocity managing general agent companies (Velocity) for total cash
consideration of $181.3 million, of which $165.6 million was received in 2022. This transaction resulted in a gain of $107.3 million that was included
in services and other revenues. Velocity provides risk origination services for the Company's Nephila insurance-linked securities fund management
operations, as well as for third parties. The Company retained a minority interest in Velocity that was recorded at fair value as of the transaction date
($47.4 million) and is accounted for under the equity method.
Metromont LLC
In December 2021, the Company acquired 51% of Metromont LLC (Metromont), a precast concrete manufacturer and concrete building solutions
provider for commercial projects. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company has the option to acquire the remaining equity
interests and the remaining equity holders have the option to sell their interests to the Company in the future. The redemption value of the remaining
equity interests is generally based on Metromont's earnings in specified periods preceding the redemption date. Total consideration for the
transaction was $274.5 million, all of which was cash.
10K - 89

As of December 31, 2021, the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of Metromont based on estimated fair
value at the acquisition date. During 2022, the Company completed the process of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed with Metromont and recognized goodwill of $101.6 million, intangible assets of $230.0 million and redeemable noncontrolling interests of
$247.4 million. The final purchase price allocation reflected differences from the preliminary purchase price allocation, including an $86.1 million
increase in the amount recognized for intangible assets upon completion of a third-party valuation and a $22.5 million decrease in the allocation to
redeemable noncontrolling interests, all of which resulted in a $117.7 million decrease to goodwill from the preliminary amount recognized. Goodwill
is primarily attributable to expected future earnings and cash flow potential of Metromont, of which the Company's share is deductible for income tax
purposes. Intangible assets include $175.0 million of customer relationships and $55.0 million of trade names, which are being amortized over 17
years and 15 years, respectively. Results attributable to Metromont are included in the Company's Markel Ventures segment.
Buckner HeavyLift Cranes
In August 2021, the Company acquired 90% of the holding company for the Buckner HeavyLift Cranes companies (Buckner), a provider of crane
rental services for large commercial contractors. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company has the option to acquire the remaining
equity interests and the remaining equity holders have the option to sell their interests to the Company in the future. The redemption value of the
remaining equity interests is generally based on Buckner's earnings in specified periods preceding the redemption dates. Total consideration for the
transaction was $237.9 million, all of which was cash.
As of December 31, 2021, the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of Buckner based on estimated fair
value at the acquisition date. During 2022, the Company completed the process of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed with Buckner and recognized goodwill of $109.9 million, intangible assets of $60.0 million and fixed assets of $290.4 million, primarily
related to cranes. The final purchase price allocation reflected differences from the preliminary purchase price allocation, including a $42.2 million
decrease in the amount recognized for the cranes upon completion of a third-party valuation, which resulted in a $35.3 million net increase to
goodwill from the preliminary amount recognized. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected future earnings and cash flow potential of Buckner,
and it is not deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets include $50.0 million of customer relationships and $10.0 million of trade names,
which are being amortized over 7 years and 15 years, respectively. Additionally, the Company assumed long-term debt of $165.1 million and
recognized redeemable noncontrolling interests of $26.4 million. Results attributable to Buckner are included in the Company's Markel Ventures
segment.
Lansing Building Products, LLC
In April 2020, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Lansing Building Products, LLC, a supplier of exterior building products and materials to
professional contractors throughout the U.S., which simultaneously acquired the distribution business of Harvey Building Products to enhance
geographic reach and scale (together, Lansing), bringing the Company's ownership in Lansing to 91%. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement,
the Company has the option to acquire the remaining equity interests and the remaining equity holders have the option to sell their interests to the
Company in the future. The redemption value of the remaining equity interests is generally based on Lansing's earnings in specified periods
preceding the redemption dates. Total consideration for both transactions was $559.2 million, all of which was cash.
The purchase price was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities of Lansing based on estimated fair value at the acquisition date. The Company
recognized goodwill of $287.1 million, which is primarily attributable to expected future earnings and cash flow potential of Lansing. The majority of
the goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company also recognized other intangible assets of $210.0 million, which
included $188.0 million of customer relationships and $22.0 million of trade names, which are being amortized over a weighted average period of 16
years and 14 years, respectively. The Company also recognized redeemable noncontrolling interests of $43.6 million. Results attributable to Lansing
are included in the Company's Markel Ventures segment.

The Company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether the decline in the fair value of any investment below its cost basis is the
result of a credit loss. All available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses are reviewed. The Company considers many factors in completing its
quarterly review of securities with unrealized losses for credit-related impairment to determine whether a credit loss exists, including the extent to
which fair value is below cost, the implied yield to maturity, rating downgrades of the security and whether or not the issuer has failed to make
scheduled principal or interest payments. The Company also takes into consideration information about the financial condition of the issuer and
industry factors that could negatively impact the capital markets.
If the decline in fair value of an available-for-sale security below its amortized cost is considered to be the result of a credit loss, the Company
compares the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. The extent to which the
estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security represents the credit loss, which is
recorded as an allowance and recognized in net income. The allowance is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of
the security. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the non-credit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive
income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Quarterly, the Company also considers whether it intends to sell an available-for-sale security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to
sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these instances, a decline in fair value is recognized in net income based on the fair value of
the security at the time of assessment, resulting in a new cost basis for the security. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not intend to sell or
believe it would be required to sell any available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of their amortized cost.

5. Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the assets or liabilities fall within different levels of the
hierarchy, the classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.
Classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy considers the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability and
transparency of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The levels
of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
• Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.
• Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability and market-corroborated inputs.
• Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable for the asset or liability and are significant to the fair value measurement.
In accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various
methods, including the market, income and cost approaches. The Company uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure assets
and liabilities at fair value, including an indication of the level within the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified.
Available-for-sale investments and equity securities. Available-for-sale investments and equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis. Available-for-sale investments include fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. Fair value is determined by the Company after
considering various sources of information, including information provided by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service provides prices for
substantially all of the Company's fixed maturity securities and equity securities. In determining fair value, the Company generally does not adjust
the prices obtained from the pricing service. The Company obtains an understanding of the pricing service's valuation methodologies and related
inputs, which include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids, offers, duration, credit ratings, estimated cash
flows and prepayment speeds. The Company validates prices provided by the pricing service by reviewing prices from other pricing sources and
analyzing pricing data in certain instances.
The Company has evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based
upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Level 1 investments include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York
Stock Exchange. Level 2 investments include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, foreign government
bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities. Level
3 investments include the Company's investments in insurance-linked securities funds that are not traded on an active exchange and are valued
using unobservable inputs.
Fair value for available-for-sale investments and equity securities is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets, if available. Due to
variations in trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices, fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 investments. The fair value of
fixed maturity securities is normally derived through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the
reporting date based upon available market observable data previously described. If there are no recent reported trades, the fair value of fixed
maturity securities may be derived through the use of matrix pricing or model processes, where future cash flow expectations are developed based
upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value of obligations of states,
municipalities and political subdivisions, corporate bonds and obligations of foreign governments include reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer
spreads, bids, offers, credit information and estimated cash flows. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value of commercial mortgage-backed
securities, residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities include the type of underlying assets, benchmark yields, prepayment
speeds, collateral information, tranche type and volatility, estimated cash flows, credit information, default rates, recovery rates, issuer spreads and
the year of issue.
10K - 95

Due to the significance of unobservable inputs required in measuring the fair value of the Company's investments in certain insurance-linked
securities funds, these investments are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the securities is derived using their
reported net asset value (NAV) as the primary input, as well as other observable and unobservable inputs as deemed necessary by management.
Management has obtained an understanding of the inputs, assumptions, process and controls used to determine NAV, which is calculated by an
independent third party. Unobservable inputs to the NAV calculations include assumptions around premium earnings patterns and loss reserve
estimates for the underlying securitized reinsurance contracts. The Company's valuation policies and procedures for Level 3 investments are
determined by management. Fair value measurements are analyzed quarterly to ensure the change in fair value from prior periods is reasonable
relative to management's understanding of the underlying investments, recent market trends and external market data.
Senior long-term debt and other debt. Senior long-term debt and other debt is carried at amortized cost with the estimated fair value disclosed on the
consolidated balance sheets. Senior long-term debt and other debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy due to variations in trading
volumes and the lack of quoted market prices. Fair value is generally derived through recent reported trades, making adjustments through the
reporting date, if necessary, based upon available market observable data including U.S. Treasury securities and implied credit spreads. Significant
inputs used to determine the fair value of senior long-term debt and other debt include reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids and
offers.
The following tables present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy.

The Company performed a quantitative impairment assessment for the Nephila reporting unit, which resulted in an $80.0 million impairment of
goodwill, reducing the goodwill of the Nephila reporting unit to $221.8 million. The Company also evaluated the intangible assets within the Nephila
reporting unit for impairment and determined they were not impaired.
The Company estimated the fair value of the Nephila reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. The
cash flow projections used in the discounted cash flow model included the Company's best estimate of future growth and margins. The discount rates
used to determine the fair value estimates were developed based on a capital asset pricing model using market-based inputs as well as an
assessment of the inherent risk in projected future cash flows. The Company's fair value estimate was negatively impacted by an increase in the
discount rate assumption in 2022, reflecting the increased cost of capital due to rising interest rates throughout 2022. Since acquiring Nephila in
2018, investment performance in the broader ILS market has been adversely impacted by consecutive years of elevated catastrophe losses, most
recently with Hurricane Ian in 2022. These events, as well as recent volatility in the capital markets, have impacted investor decisions around
allocation of capital to ILS, which in turn has impacted capital raises and redemptions within the funds Nephila manages. Following Hurricane Ian,
Nephila has seen more favorable rates on the reinsurance contracts to which the Nephila Reinsurers subscribe, which is reflective of the current
property catastrophe market and had a positive impact on Nephila's growth and performance projections. However, the impact of this favorable trend
was more than offset by the impact of further declines in investor capital within the funds Nephila manages. Cash flow assumptions reflect the
Company's best estimate of the reporting unit's future cash flows, based on information currently available, however, these assumptions are
inherently uncertain, require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change depending on the outcome of future events.

Catastrophe Losses
In 2022, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $46.2 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to
Hurricane Ian, all of which were within the Company's Insurance segment. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of
$115.3 million. The Company also had gross losses and loss adjustment expenses of $850.0 million within its program services and other fronting
operations attributed to Hurricane Ian, all of which were ceded to third-party reinsurers managed through the Company's insurance-linked securities
operations, which hold sufficient investor collateral to support the Company's related reinsurance recoverables. See note 18 for further details
regarding related party transactions with third parties managed through the Company's insurance-linked securities operations.
In 2021, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $195.0 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses from Winter
Storm Uri, European Floods and Hurricane Ida (2021 Catastrophes). The net losses and loss adjustment expenses on the 2021 Catastrophes for the
year ended December 31, 2021 were net of ceded losses of $221.7 million.
In 2020, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $172.2 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses from
Hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally, Delta and Zeta, as well as wildfires in the western U.S. and the derecho in Iowa (2020 Catastrophes). The net losses
and loss adjustment expenses on the 2020 Catastrophes for the year ended December 31, 2020 were net of ceded losses of $125.7 million.
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
In 2022, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses also included $35.7 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $44.3 million. The gross and net losses and
loss adjustment expenses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict represent the Company's best estimates as of December 31, 2022 based upon
information currently available. The Company's estimates for these losses are based on reported claims, detailed underwriting, actuarial and claims
reviews of policies and in-force assumed reinsurance contracts for potential exposures, as well as analysis of ceded reinsurance contracts and
analysis provided by the Company's brokers and claims counsel. These estimates include various assumptions about what areas within the affected
regions have incurred losses, the nature and extent of such losses, which remain difficult to verify, as well as assumptions about coverage, liability
and reinsurance. Given the significant levels of ceded reinsurance on certain of the impacted policies, a significant portion of any additional incurred
losses may be ceded. While the Company believes the gross and net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the Russia-Ukraine conflict
as of December 31, 2022 are adequate based on information currently available, the Company continues to closely monitor reported claims, ceded
reinsurance contract attachment, government actions and areas impacted by the conflict and may adjust its estimates as new information becomes
available.
COVID-19 Losses
In 2020, current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses included $358.3 million of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to
the COVID-19 pandemic. These losses and loss adjustment expenses were net of ceded losses of $106.2 million. In 2021, the Company increased its
estimate of net losses and loss adjustments expenses by $15.7 million. In 2022, the Company decreased its estimate of net losses and loss
adjustment expenses by $5.4 million.
The gross and net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to COVID-19 represent the Company's best estimates as of December 31, 2022
based upon information currently available. The Company's estimates are based on reported claims and still include assumptions about coverage,
liability and ceded reinsurance contract attachment, which, in some cases, remain subject to judicial review. While the Company believes the gross
and net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for COVID-19 as of December 31, 2022 are adequate based on information available at this
time, the Company continues to closely monitor reported claims, claim settlements, ceded reinsurance contract settlements and judicial decisions
and may adjust its estimates as new information becomes available.
10K - 102

b) Reserving Methodology
The Company uses a variety of techniques to establish the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the
ultimate amounts payable. The Company maintains reserves for specific claims incurred and reported (case reserves) and reserves for claims
incurred but not reported (IBNR reserves), which include expected development on reported claims. The Company does not discount its reserves for
losses and loss adjustment expenses to reflect estimated present value, except for reserves held for a run-off book of United Kingdom (U.K.) motor
business. Additionally, reserves assumed in connection with an acquisition are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value
adjustment includes an adjustment to reflect the acquired reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at present value plus a risk premium, the
net of which is amortized to losses and loss adjustment expenses within the consolidated statements of income.
As of any balance sheet date, all claims have not yet been reported, and some claims may not be reported for many years. As a result, the liability for
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported claims.
There is normally a time lag between when a loss event occurs and when it is reported to the Company. The actuarial methods that the Company
uses to estimate losses have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow the
Company to more accurately estimate future payments. There is also often a time lag between cedents establishing case reserves or re-estimating
their reserves and notifying the Company of those new or revised case reserves. As a result, the reporting lag is more pronounced in reinsurance
contracts than in the insurance contracts. On reinsurance transactions, the reporting lag will generally be 60 to 90 days after the end of a reporting
period, but can be longer in some cases. There may also be a more pronounced reporting lag, as well as reliance on third-party claims handling
practices and reserve estimates, on insurance contracts for which the Company is not the primary insurer and participates only in excess layers of
loss. Based on the experience of the Company's actuaries and management, the Company selects loss development factors and trending techniques
to mitigate the difficulties caused by reporting lags. At least annually, the Company evaluates its loss development factors and trending assumptions
using its own loss data, as well as cedent-specific and industry data, and updates them as needed.
IBNR reserves are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors,
using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. IBNR reserves are calculated by
subtracting paid losses and loss adjustment expenses and case reserves from estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. IBNR
reserves were 70% of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2022 compared to 67% at December 31, 2021.
In establishing liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company's actuaries estimate an ultimate loss ratio, by accident year or
underwriting year, for each product line with input from underwriting and claims personnel. For product lines in which loss reserves are established
on an underwriting year basis, the Company has developed a methodology to convert from underwriting year to accident year for financial reporting
purposes. In estimating an ultimate loss ratio for a particular line of business, the actuaries may use one or more actuarial reserving methods and
select from these a single point estimate. To varying degrees, these methods include detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting, settlement
activity, claim frequency and severity, policyholder loss experience, industry loss experience and changes in market and economic conditions, policy
forms and exposures. Greater judgment may be required when new product lines are introduced or when there have been changes in claims handling
practices, as the statistical data available may be insufficient. Greater judgment also may be required for product lines that experience a low
frequency of high severity claims, particularly when the Company is reliant on third party case reserve estimates and claims handling practices.
These estimates also reflect implicit and explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of external factors, including economic and social
inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, general economic conditions and recent trends in these factors. Management believes the process of
evaluating past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future
events.
10K - 103

Estimates for losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as pandemics and wars, are based on claims
received to date, industry loss estimates and output from both industry, broker and proprietary models, as well as analysis of the Company's ceded
reinsurance contracts. The Company may also perform detailed policy and reinsurance contract level reviews. The availability of data from these
procedures varies depending on the timing of the event relative to the point at which the Company develops its estimates. The Company also
considers loss experience on historical events that may have similar characteristics to the underlying event and current market conditions, including
the level of economic inflation. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases
with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. As additional claims are reported and paid, and industry loss estimates are revised, the
Company incorporates this new information into its analysis and adjusts its estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses as appropriate.
For example, both the gross and net losses on Hurricane Ian and the 2021 and 2020 Catastrophes, as of December 31, 2022 represent the
Company's best estimates based upon information currently available. For Hurricane Ian, these estimates are still dependent on assumptions about
coverage, liability and reinsurance. While the Company believes the gross and net reserves for these events as of December 31, 2022 are adequate,
it continues to closely monitor reported claims and may adjust its estimates as new information becomes available.
Loss reserves are established at management's best estimate, which is developed using the actuarially calculated point estimate as the starting
point. The actuarial point estimate represents the actuaries' estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the losses that
have occurred at a particular point in time; however, there is inherent uncertainty in the point estimate as it is the expected value in a range of
possible reserve estimates. In some cases, actuarial analyses, which are generally based on statistical analysis, cannot fully incorporate all of the
subjective factors that affect development of losses. In other cases, management's perspective of these more subjective factors may differ from the
actuarial perspective. Subjective factors influencing the development of management's best estimate include: the credibility and timeliness of claims
and loss information received from cedents and other third parties, economic and social inflation, judicial decisions, changes in law, changes in
underwriting or claims handling practices, general economic conditions, the risk of moral hazard and other current and developing trends within the
insurance and reinsurance markets, including the effects of competition. For example, the Company's loss experience in recent years has reflected
higher than anticipated levels of economic inflation, as well as the impacts of social inflation.
Inherent in the Company's reserving practices is the desire to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient, and therefore, will
ultimately prove to be adequate. This approach to establishing loss reserves typically results in loss reserves that exceed the calculated actuarial
point estimate. However, following an acquisition of insurance operations, acquired reserves initially are recorded at fair value, and therefore the
acquired loss reserves may be closer to the actuarial point estimate until the Company builds total loss reserves that are consistent with the
Company's historic level of confidence. Management continually attempts to improve its loss estimation process by refining its ability to analyze loss
development patterns, claim payments and other information, but uncertainty remains regarding the potential for adverse development of estimated
ultimate liabilities.
The Company's ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves. Changes in the Company's estimated ultimate liability for loss reserves
generally occur as a result of the emergence of unanticipated loss activity, the completion of specific actuarial or claims studies or changes in
internal or external factors that impact the assumptions used to derive the Company's estimates. The Company closely monitors new information on
reported claims and uses statistical analyses prepared by its actuaries to evaluate the adequacy of recorded reserves. Management exercises
judgment when assessing the relative credibility of loss development trends.
Management currently believes the Company's gross and net reserves are adequate. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact
of any significant factor on the adequacy of reserves, and actual results will differ from original estimates.

c) Prior Accident Year Loss Development
The following tables summarize, by segment, the product lines with the most significant changes in prior accident years loss reserves for the years
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, along with the corresponding accident years and the trends and factors that impacted management's
best estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses on underlying products in each of these product lines. The Company does not
estimate losses at this level of aggregation as it offers a diverse portfolio of products and manages these products in logical groupings within each
underwriting segment. As a result of the trends and factors described in the following tables, the Company's actuaries adjusted their estimates of the
ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Additionally, for those product lines with favorable development on prior accident
years loss reserves, management has now given more credibility to the favorable trends observed by the Company's actuaries and after also
incorporating these favorable trends into its best estimate, reduced prior years loss reserves accordingly. The unfavorable claims and loss trends
experienced on certain accident years within the Company's professional liability and general liability product lines in 2022 reflected broader market
conditions, including the effects of economic and social inflation, as well as delays in court proceedings that began in 2020 and disrupted the
development of the claims trend. These trends were most impactful on the 2018 and 2019 accident years for the professional liability product lines
and the 2016 to 2019 accident years for the general liability product lines. Consistent with the Company's reserving philosophy, management is
responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of previous expectations.

d) Historic Loss Development
The following tables present undiscounted loss development information, by accident year, for the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments,
including cumulative incurred and paid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as well as the corresponding amount of
IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2022. This level of disaggregation is consistent with how the Company analyzes loss reserves for both internal and
external reporting purposes. The loss development information for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2021 is presented as supplementary
information. All amounts included in the following tables related to transactions denominated in a foreign currency have been translated into U.S.
Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2022.
The difference between the segment loss development implied by the tables for the year ended December 31, 2022 and actual losses and loss
adjustment expenses recognized on prior accident years for the Insurance and Reinsurance segments for the year ended December 31, 2022 is
primarily attributed to the fact that amounts presented in these tables exclude amounts attributed to the 2012 and prior accident years. Favorable
development on 2012 and prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $50.8 million and $36.9 million for the Insurance and
Reinsurance segments and reflects modest favorable development across many of the Company's product lines on accident years prior to 2013.
The remaining difference between the segment loss development implied by the tables for the year ended December 31, 2022 and actual losses and
loss adjustment expenses on prior accident years is attributed to the fact that amounts presented in these tables exclude unallocated loss
adjustment expenses and exclude amounts attributable to reserve discounting and fair value adjustments recorded in conjunction with acquisitions,
as well as differences in the presentation of foreign currency movements, as previously described, none of which are material to the Insurance or
Reinsurance segments.
The Insurance segment table that follows also includes claim frequency information, by accident year. The Company defines a claim as a single claim
incident, per policy, which may include multiple claimants and multiple coverages on a single policy. Claim counts include claims closed without a
payment as well as claims where the Company is monitoring to determine if an exposure exists, even if a reserve has not been established.
All of the business contained within the Company's Reinsurance segment represents treaty business that is assumed from other insurance or
reinsurance companies, for which the Company does not have access to the underlying claim counts. Further, this business includes both quota share
and excess of loss treaty reinsurance, through which only a portion of each reported claim results in losses to the Company. As such, the Company
has excluded claim count information from the Reinsurance segment disclosures.

e) The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims primarily resulting from policies written by acquired insurance operations
before their acquisition by the Company. The Company's exposure to A&E claims originated from umbrella, excess and commercial general liability
insurance policies and assumed reinsurance contracts that were written on an occurrence basis from the 1970s to mid-1980s. Exposure also
originated from claims-made policies that were designed to cover environmental risks provided that all other terms and conditions of the policy were
met. A&E claims include property damage and clean-up costs related to pollution, as well as personal injury allegedly arising from exposure to
hazardous materials. Development on A&E loss reserves is monitored separately from the Company's ongoing underwriting operations and is not
included in a reportable segment.
At December 31, 2022, A&E reserves were $153.2 million and $54.5 million on a gross and net basis, respectively. At December 31, 2021, A&E
reserves were $218.6 million and $66.2 million on a gross and net basis, respectively.
The Company's reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to A&E exposures represent management's best estimate of ultimate
settlement values based on statistical analysis of these reserves by the Company's actuaries. A&E exposures are subject to significant uncertainty
due to potential loss severity and frequency resulting from the uncertain and unfavorable legal climate. A&E reserves could be subject to increases in
the future, however, management believes the Company's gross and net A&E reserves at December 31, 2022 are adequate.
12. Reinsurance
In reinsurance and retrocession transactions, an insurance or reinsurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a
premium. The ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and the
Company will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance or retrocessional
agreement. A credit risk exists with ceded reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under the
reinsurance or retrocessional contracts. Allowances are established for credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the reinsurance
recoverables.
10K - 110

Within its underwriting operations, the Company uses reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance to manage its net retention on individual risks and
overall exposure to losses while providing it with the ability to offer policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs.
Within the Company's underwriting operations, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, balances recoverable from the ten largest reinsurers, by group,
represented 62% and 63%, respectively, of reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral. At December 31,
2022, the largest reinsurance balance was due from RenaissanceRe and represented 11% of reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance
allowances and collateral.
Within its program services and other fronting businesses, the Company generally enters into quota share reinsurance agreements whereby the
Company cedes to the capacity providers (reinsurers) substantially all of its gross liability under all policies issued by and on behalf of the Company
by a general agent. However, there are certain programs that contain limits on the reinsurers' obligations to the Company that expose the Company
to underwriting risk, including loss ratio caps, exclusions of the credit risk of producers and aggregate reinsurance limits that the Company believes
are unlikely to be exceeded. The Company also remains exposed to the credit risk of the reinsurer, or the risk that one of its reinsurers becomes
insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to pay policyholder claims. This credit risk is generally mitigated by either selecting well capitalized, highly
rated authorized capacity providers or requiring that the capacity provider post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks, which, in some
instances, exceeds the related reinsurance recoverable.
Within the Company's program services business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, balances recoverable from the ten largest reinsurers, by group,
represented 67% and 68%, respectively, of reinsurance recoverables before considering reinsurance allowances and collateral. At December 31,
2022, the largest reinsurance balance was due from Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) and represented 13% of reinsurance recoverables before considering
reinsurance allowances and collateral. All of the Company's other fronting business is conducted on behalf of its Nephila ILS operations; therefore, all
of the reinsurance recoverables within these operations are attributable to entities it manages. See note 18.

Total $ 759,025 $ 902,980
Life and annuity benefit reserves are compiled on a reinsurance contract-by-contract basis and are discounted using standard actuarial techniques
and cash flow models. Since the development of the life and annuity reinsurance reserves is based upon cash flow projection models, the Company
must make estimates and assumptions based on cedent experience, industry mortality tables, and expense and investment experience, including a
provision for adverse deviation. The assumptions used to determine policy benefit reserves are generally locked-in for the life of the contract unless
an unlocking event occurs. Loss recognition testing is performed to determine if existing policy benefit reserves, together with the present value of
future gross premiums and expected investment income earned thereon, are adequate to cover the present value of future benefits, settlement and
maintenance costs. If the existing policy benefit reserves are not sufficient, the locked-in assumptions are revised to current best estimate
assumptions and a charge to earnings for life and annuity benefits is recognized at that time. See note 1(x) for information on changes to the
accounting for life and annuity benefits beginning in 2023.
10K - 112

Life and annuity benefit reserves are also adjusted to the extent unrealized gains on the investments supporting the policy benefit reserves would
result in a reserve deficiency if those gains were realized. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative increase to life and annuity benefits attributable
to unrealized gains on the underlying investment portfolio totaled $56.6 million, all of which reversed in 2022 as a result of an increase in the market
yield on the investment securities supporting the policy benefit reserves. During 2021, the Company decreased life and annuity benefits by $63.0
million, reflecting an increase in the market yield on the investment securities supporting the policy benefit reserves, and increased the change in net
unrealized holding gains included in other comprehensive loss by a corresponding amount. During 2020, the Company increased life and annuity
benefits by $68.2 million, as a result of a decrease in the market yield on the investment securities supporting the policy benefit reserves, and
decreased the change in net unrealized holding gains included in other comprehensive income by a corresponding amount.
Because of the assumptions and estimates used in establishing the Company's reserves for life and annuity benefit obligations and the long-term
nature of these reinsurance contracts, the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimates. The average discount rate for the life and
annuity benefit reserves was 2.3% as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, the largest life and annuity benefits reserve for a single contract was 33.7% of the total.
None of the annuities included in life and annuity benefits on the consolidated balance sheets are subject to discretionary withdrawal.

The Company's other debt includes $414.1 million and $287.6 million associated with its Markel Ventures subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively, which includes amounts outstanding on their respective credit facilities. The Markel Ventures debt is non-recourse to the holding
company and generally is secured by the assets of those subsidiaries.
Various of the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries maintain revolving credit facilities or lines of credit, which provide up to $620 million of
aggregate capacity for working capital and other general operational purposes. A portion of the capacity on certain of these credit facilities may be
used as security for letters of credit and other obligations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $238.1 million and $94.3 million, respectively, of
borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities. As of December 31, 2022, one of the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries was not in
compliance with certain financial covenants of its revolving credit facility, which had an outstanding balance of $97.9 million as of December 31,
2022. The subsidiary is working with its lenders and anticipates amending the facility. This event is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. At December 31, 2022, all of the Company's other subsidiaries were in
compliance with all covenants contained in their respective credit facilities.
The estimated fair value of the Company's senior long-term debt and other debt was $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,

capacity may be used for letters of credit. The Company may increase the capacity of the facility by up to $200 million subject to obtaining
commitments for the increase and certain other terms and conditions. The Company pays interest on balances outstanding under the facility and a
utilization fee for letters of credit issued under the facility. The Company also pays a commitment fee (0.20% at December 31, 2022) on the unused
portion of the facility based on the Company's leverage ratio as calculated under the credit agreement. The credit agreement includes financial
covenants that require that the Company not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum amount of consolidated net worth, as well

Net deferred tax liability $ 836,815 $ 1,413,362
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis by taxing jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2022 and
2021, the Company's consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax liabilities of $874.0 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, in other
liabilities and net deferred tax assets of $37.2 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in other assets.
At December 31, 2022, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of $18.3 million, substantially all of which related to foreign tax credits to be used
against U.S. income tax. The Company expects to utilize all tax credit carryforwards before expiration. The earliest any of these credits will expire is
2031.
At December 31, 2022, the Company also had net operating losses of $82.0 million that can be used to offset future taxable income, most of which is
attributable to losses of certain branch operations in Europe incurred in their local jurisdictions. The Company's ability to use the majority of these
losses is not subject to expiration. As described below, the deferred tax assets related to losses at certain of the Company's subsidiaries and
branches are offset by valuation allowances.
At December 31, 2022, the Company had total gross deferred tax assets of $667.7 million. The Company has a valuation allowance of $16.9 million
to offset gross deferred tax assets primarily attributable to cumulative net operating losses at certain of the Company's subsidiaries and branches.
The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the remaining $650.7 million of gross deferred tax assets through generating
taxable income or the reversal of existing temporary differences attributable to the gross deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, the Company's net
deferred tax liability for investments includes deferred tax assets attributed to its unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities. The Company has
the ability and intent to execute a tax planning strategy such that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized.
At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any material unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any changes in
unrecognized tax benefits during 2023 that would have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision.

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's
2017 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company believes its income tax liabilities are adequate as of December 31, 2022, however, these liabilities
could be adjusted as a result of this examination. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by tax
authorities for years ended before January 1, 2017.
16. Employee Benefit Plans
a) The Company maintains defined contribution plans for employees of its U.S. insurance operations in accordance with Section 401(k) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Employees of the Company's Markel Ventures subsidiaries are provided post-retirement benefits under separate
defined contribution plans. The Company also provides various defined contribution plans for employees of its international insurance operations,
which are in line with local market terms and conditions of employment. Expenses relating to the Company's defined contribution plans were $57.9
million, $52.7 million and $48.6 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
b) The Terra Nova Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the Company's international insurance operations who
meet the eligibility conditions set out in the plan. The plan has been closed to new participants since 2001, and employees have not accrued benefits
for future service in the plan since April 2012. The projected benefit obligations of the Terra Nova Pension Plan as of December 31, 2022 and 2021
were $108.5 million and $210.2 million, respectively, and the related fair value of plan assets was $171.7 million and $243.6 million, respectively.
The corresponding net asset for pension benefits, also referred to as the funded status of the plan, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was included in
other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
17. Variable Interest Entities
MCIM, a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is an insurance-linked securities investment fund manager and reinsurance manager
headquartered in Bermuda. Results attributable to MCIM are not included in a reportable segment.
MCIM serves as the insurance manager for Markel CATCo Re Ltd. (Markel CATCo Re), a Bermuda Class 3 reinsurance company, and as the investment
manager for Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd., a Bermuda exempted mutual fund company comprised of multiple segregated accounts (Markel
CATCo Funds). Voting shares in Markel CATCo Reinsurance Fund Ltd. and Markel CATCo Re are held by MCIM, which has the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. The Markel CATCo Funds issued multiple classes of nonvoting,
redeemable preference shares to investors, and the Markel CATCo Funds are primarily invested in nonvoting preference shares of Markel CATCo Re.
The underwriting results of Markel CATCo Re are attributed to investors through its nonvoting preference shares. Both Markel CATCo Re and the
Markel CATCo Funds were placed into run-off in July 2019.
In March 2022, the Company completed a buy-out transaction with Markel CATCo Re and the Markel CATCo Funds that provided for an accelerated
return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company provided cash funding of
$45.1 million to purchase substantially all of the Markel CATCo Funds' interests in Markel CATCo Re. See note 21 for further details regarding the
terms of the buy-out transaction. As part of the transaction, substantially all of the preference shares held by investors in the Markel CATCo Funds
were redeemed, including preference shares previously held by the Company. See note 5 for details regarding the Company's investment in the
Markel CATCo Funds.
During June 2022, the Company received a return of $24.9 million of the capital it provided in March 2022 and the related preference shares were
redeemed. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's investment in the remaining preference shares of Markel CATCo Re totaled $20.1 million, which
comprised 23% of the equity of Markel CATCo Re. Through that investment, the Company has exposure to adverse loss development on reinsurance
contracts previously written by Markel CATCo Re for loss events that occurred from 2014 to 2020. If loss reserves held by Markel CATCo Re are
sufficient to settle claims on the remaining open contracts, the Company will receive a full return of the remaining $20.1 million in capital. Favorable
development on loss reserves held by Markel CATCo Re, less operating expenses, will be distributed to the Markel CATCo Funds, and ultimately to
investors in the Markel CATCo Funds.
Markel CATCo Re is considered a VIE, as the equity at risk does not have the right to receive residual returns that exceed the capital provided by the
Company in the buy-out transaction. As a result of the preference shares acquired by the Company in the buy-out transaction, and the voting shares
held by its consolidated subsidiary, MCIM, the Company consolidates Markel CATCo Re as its primary beneficiary. Results attributed to the run-off of
Markel CATCo Re are reported with the Company's other ILS operations, within services and other revenues and expenses, and are not included in a
reportable segment. For the
10K - 117

year ended December 31, 2022, there was $89.9 million of favorable loss reserve development on the run-off of reinsurance contracts written by
Markel CATCo Re, all of which was included in services and other expenses and attributable to noncontrolling interests.
The Company's consolidated balance sheet includes the following amounts attributable to Markel CATCo Re.
(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022
Assets
Cash and cash equivalents $ 104,443
Restricted cash and cash equivalents 317,577

In connection with the buy-out transaction, the Company also entered into a tail risk cover with Markel CATCo Re. Through this contract, the
Company has $142.7 million of uncollateralized exposure to adverse development on loss reserves held by Markel CATCo Re for loss exposures in
excess of limits that the Company believes are unlikely to be exceeded.
18. Related Party Transactions
The Company engages in certain related party transactions in the normal course of business at arm's length.
Insurance-Linked Securities
Within the Company's insurance-linked securities operations, the Company provides investment and insurance management services through
Nephila Holdings Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Nephila). Nephila serves as the investment manager to several Bermuda based private funds
(the Nephila Funds). To provide access for the Nephila Funds to a variety of insurance-linked securities in the property catastrophe, climate and
specialty markets, Nephila also acts as an insurance manager to certain Bermuda Class 3 and 3A reinsurance companies, Lloyd's Syndicate 2357 and
Lloyd's Syndicate 2358 (collectively, the Nephila Reinsurers). Nephila receives management fees for investment and insurance management services
provided through its insurance-linked securities operations primarily based on the net asset value of the accounts managed, and, for certain funds,
incentive fees based on their annual performance. Prior to the disposition of Velocity in February 2022, Nephila also provided managing general
agent services to the Nephila Reinsurers in exchange for commissions. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total revenues
attributed to unconsolidated entities managed by Nephila were $79.5 million, $141.9 million and $152.0 million, respectively.
Through the Company's program services and other fronting operations, as well as its underwriting operations, the Company has programs with
Nephila through which the Company writes insurance policies that are either partially or fully ceded to Nephila Reinsurers. Through the Company's
program services and other fronting platforms, Nephila utilizes certain of the Company's licensed insurance companies to write U.S. catastrophe
exposed property risk that is then ceded to Nephila Reinsurers. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, gross premiums written
through the Company's program services and other fronting platforms on behalf of Nephila were $1.0 billion, $689.2 million and $412.4 million,
respectively, all of which were ceded to Nephila Reinsurers. Through the Company's insurance underwriting operations, the Company has a quota
share agreement with Nephila through which it cedes a portion of its property business to Nephila Reinsurers. For the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's underwriting operations ceded premiums of $65.6 million, $55.0 million and $47.6 million, respectively, to
Nephila Reinsurers as part of its quota share agreement.
10K - 118

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, reinsurance recoverables on the consolidated balance sheets included $1.4 billion and $807.0 million,
respectively, due from Nephila Reinsurers. Under its programs with Nephila Reinsurers, the Company bears underwriting risk for annual aggregate
agreement year losses in excess of a limit the Company believes is unlikely to be exceeded. To the extent losses under these programs exceed the
prescribed limits, the Company is obligated to pay such losses to the cedents without recourse to the Nephila Reinsurers. While the Company
believes losses under these programs are unlikely, those losses, if incurred, could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations
and financial condition.
The Company has also entered into other assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions with the Nephila Reinsurers in the normal course of business,
which are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Hagerty
The Company holds a minority ownership interest in Hagerty, which operates primarily as a managing general agent and also includes Hagerty
Reinsurance Limited (Hagerty Re), a Bermuda Class 3 reinsurance company. Through the Company's underwriting operations, the Company
underwrites insurance for Hagerty, and a portion of this insurance is ceded to Hagerty Re. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
the Company's gross written premiums attributable to Hagerty were $689.7 million, $596.9 million and $506.7 million, respectively, of which $456.6
million, $338.9 million and $239.3 million, respectively, were ceded to Hagerty Re. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, reinsurance recoverables on
the consolidated balance sheets included $159.7 million and $95.6 million, respectively, due from Hagerty Re.
19. Shareholders' Equity
a) The Company has 50,000,000 shares of no par value common stock authorized. The following table presents a rollforward of changes in common
shares issued and outstanding.
Years Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2022 2021

Issuance of common shares 24 18
Repurchase of common shares (233) (169)
Issued and outstanding common shares, end of year 13,423 13,632
b) The Company also has 10,000,000 shares of no par value preferred stock authorized, of which 600,000 shares were issued and outstanding at
December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has the option to redeem the preferred shares:
• in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90 days after the occurrence of a "rating agency event," at $1,020 per preferred share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends,
• in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90 days after the occurrence of a "regulatory capital event" at $1,000 per preferred share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, or
• in whole or in part, on June 1, 2025, or every fifth anniversary of that date, at $1,000 per preferred share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
A "rating agency event" means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that publishes a rating for the Company amends, clarifies
or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities like the preferred shares, which results in shortening the length of time that the
preferred shares are assigned a particular level of equity credit or in the lowering of the equity credit assigned to the preferred shares.
A "regulatory capital event" means that the Company becomes subject to capital adequacy supervision by a capital regulator and determines that,
under such capital adequacy guidelines, the liquidation preference amount of the preferred shares would not qualify as capital.
The preferred shares rank senior to the Company's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. Holders of the
preferred shares are entitled to receive non-cumulative cash dividends, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, from the original issue
date, semi-annually in arrears on the first day of June and December of each year. The Company accrues dividends when they are declared by the
Board of Directors. To the extent declared, these dividends will accrue, on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, at a fixed annual rate of
6.00% from the original issue date to
10K - 119

June 1, 2025. After June 1, 2025, the dividend rate will reset every five years and accrue at an annual rate equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury Rate
as of two business days prior to the reset date, plus 5.662%. Dividends will not be cumulative and will not be mandatory. Accordingly, if dividends are
not declared for any dividend period, then dividends for that dividend period will not accrue and will not be payable.
For both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company declared and paid dividends on preferred shares of $36.0 million, or $60.00 per
share.

(1) The Company has issued grants and awards of restricted stock units to employees as performance, retention or hiring incentives, as well as awards of restricted stock to
non-employee directors, under its equity incentive compensation plan. At December 31, 2022, there were 116,431 shares available for future awards under the Company's
equity incentive compensation plan.
(2) The impact of 33 thousand shares from restricted stock units and restricted stock was excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the year
ended December 31, 2022 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

21. Commitments and Contingencies
a) In March 2022, the Company completed a buy-out transaction with Markel CATCo Re and the Markel CATCo Funds, which are currently in run-off,
that provided for an accelerated return of all remaining capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. Under the terms of the transaction, the
Company provided cash funding of $45.1 million to purchase substantially all of the Markel CATCo Funds' investments in Markel CATCo Re and also
provided tail risk cover of $142.7 million to Markel CATCo Re to allow for the release of collateral to investors. In order to complete the transaction,
the Company also made $101.9 million in additional payments, net of insurance proceeds, to or for the benefit of investors, which were recognized as
an expense to the Company and included in services and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022. In conjunction with the buy-out
transaction, all investors holding securities in the Markel CATCo Funds, the Markel CATCo Group Companies (MCIM, the Markel CATCo Funds and
Markel CATCo Re), Markel Corporation and each of their related parties, among others, granted mutual releases of all claims related to the
transaction, the Markel CATCo Group Companies' businesses and the investors' investments in the Funds, including any pending litigation. See note
17 for further details about the Company's Markel CATCo operations and the buy-out transaction.
b) Contingencies arise in the normal course of the Company's operations and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations.
22. Statutory Financial Information
a) The following table summarizes statutory capital and surplus for the Company's insurance subsidiaries.
December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2022 2021
United States $ 5,236,793 $ 4,493,310
United Kingdom $ 749,495 $ 736,575
Bermuda $ 1,895,132 $ 2,106,606
Germany $ 125,194 $ 95,693
As of December 31, 2022, the Company's actual statutory capital and surplus significantly exceeded the regulatory requirements. As a result, the
amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements is not significant in relation to actual statutory capital and
surplus.
The following table summarizes statutory net income (loss) for the Company's insurance subsidiaries.
Years Ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2020
United States $ 689,341 $ 705,908 $ 616,135
United Kingdom $ 35,719 $ 56,546 $ (25,776)
Bermuda $ (144,239) $ 556,275 $ 228,740
Germany $ (2,471) $ 1,780 $ (4,628)
Amounts presented for the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries have been calculated in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules. For
the Company's international insurance subsidiaries, the regulations that govern the calculation of statutory capital and surplus do not provide
requirements for the calculation of net income. Rather, such amounts are reported in accordance with a basis of accounting permitted by their
respective regulator. Amounts presented for the Company's U.K., Bermuda and German insurance subsidiaries have been calculated in accordance
with U.K. GAAP, U.S. GAAP and German GAAP, respectively.
United States
The laws of the domicile states of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries govern the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company.
Generally, statutes in the domicile states of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries require prior approval for payment of extraordinary, as
opposed to ordinary, dividends. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's U.S. insurance
10K - 121

subsidiaries could pay up to $655.6 million to the holding company during the following 12 months under the ordinary dividend regulations.
In converting from U.S. statutory accounting principles to U.S. GAAP, typical adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs, differences in the
calculation of deferred income taxes and the inclusion of net unrealized gains or losses relating to fixed maturity securities in shareholders' equity.
The Company does not use any permitted statutory accounting practices that are different from prescribed statutory accounting practices which
impact statutory capital and surplus.
United Kingdom
The Company's U.K. insurance subsidiary, Markel International Insurance Company Limited (MIICL), and its Lloyd's managing agent, Markel Syndicate
Management Limited (MSM), are authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA). The PRA oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements, minimum solvency margins and
individual capital assessment requirements under the Solvency II Directive (Solvency II) and imposes dividend restrictions, while both the PRA and
the FCA oversee compliance with risk assessment reviews and various other requirements. MIICL is required to give advance notice to the PRA for
any transaction or proposed transaction with a connected or related person. MSM is required to satisfy the solvency requirements of Lloyd's. In
addition, the Company's U.K. subsidiaries must comply with the United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006, which provides that dividends may only be
paid out of profits available for that purpose. Earnings of the Company's U.K. insurance subsidiaries are available for distribution to the holding
company to the extent not otherwise restricted.
Bermuda
The Company's Bermuda insurance subsidiary, Markel Bermuda Limited (MBL), is subject to enhanced capital requirements in addition to minimum
solvency and liquidity requirements. The enhanced capital requirement is determined by reference to a risk-based capital model that determines a
control threshold for statutory capital and surplus by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurer's business. At
December 31, 2022, MBL satisfied both the enhanced capital requirements and the minimum solvency and liquidity requirements.
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, MBL is prohibited from paying or declaring dividends during a fiscal year if it is in breach of its enhanced capital
requirement, solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of the dividend would cause a breach of those
requirements. If an insurer fails to meet its solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from
declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Further, MBL is
prohibited from declaring or paying, in any financial year, dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus as set forth in its
previous year's statutory balance sheet unless at least seven days before payment of those dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit stating that it
will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. MBL must obtain the BMA's prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of
the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year's financial statements. In addition, as a long-term insurer, MBL may not declare or pay a
dividend to any person other than a policyholder unless the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by MBL's approved actuary,
exceeds the liabilities of its long-term business. The amount of the dividend cannot exceed the aggregate of that excess and any other funds legally
available for the payment of the dividend. As of December 31, 2022, MBL could pay up to $473.8 million to the holding company during the following
12 months without making any additional filings with the BMA.
Germany
The Company's German insurance subsidiary, Markel Insurance SE, is regulated by the Federal Financial Conduct Authority in Germany and is also
subject to capital and solvency requirements under Solvency II.
b) Lloyd's sets the corporate members' required capital annually based on each syndicates' business plans, rating environment, reserving
environment and input arising from Lloyd's discussions with, among others, regulatory and rating agencies. Such required capital is referred to as
Funds at Lloyd's (FAL) and comprises cash and investments. The amount of cash and investments held as FAL as of December 31, 2022 was $873.0
million. Of this amount, $335.4 million was provided by the holding company and is not available for general use by the Company. The remaining
amount, provided by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, is not available for distribution to the holding company. The Company's corporate
member may also be required to maintain funds under the control of Lloyd's in excess of its capital requirements and such funds also may not be
available for distribution to the holding company.

24. Immaterial Correction to Prior Period Financial Statements for Accounting Policy Change
The Company defers and amortizes costs directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts over the related policy
period, generally one year. Previously, the Company did not defer salaries and benefits associated with the successful acquisition of insurance
contracts, as such amounts were quantified and assessed each period and were deemed not to be material to the consolidated financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2022, the Company changed its accounting policy to defer salaries and benefits associated with the successful acquisition of
insurance contracts in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 944, Financial Services–Insurance.
To reflect the change in accounting policy, the Company made a cumulative adjustment to increase deferred policy acquisition costs by $28.2 million,
increase deferred tax liabilities by $5.9 million and increase retained earnings by $22.3 million as of January 1, 2020, which is the beginning of the
earliest year presented in the consolidated financial statements included herein. These increases in deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred tax
liabilities and retained earnings are reflected as increases to the previously reported amounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2021 and as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020 in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in
equity for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company considered both the quantitative and qualitative factors within the provisions of U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effect of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and determined that the impact of the change in accounting
policy was not material to the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. The Company did not adjust the amounts previously
presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 for the change in
accounting policy as the effects were not material. The cumulative income statement effect for those periods was included in the consolidated
statement of loss and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2022, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls),
as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). This evaluation was conducted under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer (PEO) and the Principal Financial Officer (PFO).
Based upon this evaluation, the PEO and PFO concluded that effective Disclosure Controls were in place to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
human failures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of internal control over financial reporting also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that we maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.
KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Markel Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Markel Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the
related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
