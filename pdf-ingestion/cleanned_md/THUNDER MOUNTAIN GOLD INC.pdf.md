Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to be "forward-looking statements." All statements, other than
statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-K that address activities, events or developments that our management expects, believes or
anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include discussion of such matters as:
The amount and nature of future capital, development and exploration expenditures;
The timing of exploration activities, and;
Business strategies and development of our Operational Plans.
Forward-looking statements also typically include words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "potential", "could" or similar words suggesting
future outcomes. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of
historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Such
statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including such factors as the volatility and level of metal prices,
uncertainties in cash flow, expected acquisition benefits, exploration, mining and operating risks, competition, litigation, environmental matters,
the potential impact of government regulations, many of which are beyond our control. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-
looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as
a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Management's Discussion and Analysis is intended to be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and the integral notes
("Notes") thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The following statements may be forward looking in nature and actual results may
differ materially.
ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company History
The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on November 9, 1935, under the name of Montgomery Mines, Inc. In
April 1978 controlling interest in the Montgomery Mines Corporation was obtained by a group of the Thunder Mountain property holders who then
changed the corporate name to Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. with the primary goal to further develop their holdings in the Thunder Mountain
Mining District, Valley County, Idaho.
Change in Situs and Authorized Capital
The Company moved its situs from Idaho to Nevada, but maintains its corporate offices in Boise, Idaho. On December 10, 2007, articles of
incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State in Nevada for Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., a Nevada Corporation. The Directors of Thunder
Mountain Gold, Inc. (Nevada) were the same as for Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Idaho).
On January 25, 2008, the shareholders approved the merger of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Idaho) with Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Nevada),
which was completed by a share for share exchange of common stock. The terms of the merger were such that the Nevada Corporation was the
surviving entity. The number of authorized shares for the Nevada Corporation is 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001
per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.
4

The Company is structured as follows: The Company owns 100% of the outstanding stock of Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. (TMRI), a Nevada
Corporation. Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. owns 100% of the outstanding stock of South Mountain Mines, Inc., an Idaho Corporation. South
Mountain Mines, Inc. owns 75% of Owyhee Gold Territory, LLC.
We have no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance. The business is not of a
seasonal nature. Since the potential products are traded in the open market, we have no control over the competitive conditions in the industry.
There is no backlog of orders.
There are numerous Federal and State laws and regulation related to environmental protection, which have direct application to mining and milling
activities. The more significant of these laws deal with mined land reclamation and wastewater discharge from mines and milling operations. We do
not believe that these laws and regulations as presently enacted will have a direct material adverse effect on our operations.
Subsidiary Companies
On May 21, 2007, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State in Nevada for Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. The financial information for the new subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial
statements.
On September 27, 2007, Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. (TMRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (THMG), completed
the purchase of all the outstanding stock of South Mountain Mines, Inc., an Idaho corporation. On November 8, 2012, South Mountain Mines, Inc.,
("SMMI") a wholly owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Idaho
State Gold Company II LLC ("ISGC") formed Owyhee Gold Territory LLC ("OGT") (aka Owyhee Gold Trust, LLC) a limited liability company (LLC).
On November 4, 2016, SMMI was granted Managing Member and controlling Member of OGT, through a judicially ratified settlement with ISGC
II.
Current Operations
Thunder Mountain Gold is a mineral exploration stage company with no producing mines. The Company intends to remain in the business of
exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities.
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the "BeMetals Option Agreement") with BeMetals Corp., a British
Columbia corporation ("BeMetals"), and BeMetals USA Corp., a Delaware corporation ("BMET USA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals.
Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of SMMI
from TMRI, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. SMMI is the Company's subsidiary that holds the Company's investment in the South
Mountain project mineral interest. The original term of the agreement is for two years with BeMetals completing a preliminary economic
assessment ("PEA") completed by a mutually agreed third-party engineering firm. On May 18, 2020, the Company extended the BMET Option
Agreement by three months from the existing BeMetals Option Agreement date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and business conditions
surrounding restricted international travel, and corresponding access to capital markets.
On September 14, 2021, the BeMetals Option Agreement was amended, prompting BeMetals to complete the Tranche 6 payment to the Company,
with the addition of Tranches 7 and 8. The option period has been extended to December 31, 2022, unless agreed to be extended by all Parties.
Pursuant to the amended BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to purchase 100% of the outstanding shares of SMMI from TMRI
if the following obligations are satisfied:
5

Tranche 1: cash payment of $100,000 to TMRI within 1 business day of delivery of voting support agreements from shareholders of THMG
who hold or control shares carrying more than 50% of the voting rights attached to all outstanding THMG Shares. Payment was received on
March 5, 2019 and is nonrefundable.
Tranche 2: Tranche 2 conditions were completed on June 10, 2019, with the issuance of 10 million common shares of BMET USA to TMRI
having a fair value of $1,883,875; and BMET USA's purchase of 2.5 million shares of THMG common stock at a price of $0.10 per share, for an
aggregate purchase price of $250,000, on a private placement basis (received June 2019).
Tranche 3: Cash payment of $250,000 on or before the 6-month anniversary of the Tranche 2. Payment was received on December 10,
2019.
Tranche 4: Cash payment of $250,000 on or before the 15-month anniversary of the Tranche 2, was received on September 10, 2020, and
was recognized as a gain on sale of mineral interest during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Tranche 5: Cash payment of $250,000 on or before the 21-month anniversary of the Tranche 2, was received on March 5, 2021, and
recognized as a gain on sale of mineral interest for the period ended March 31, 2021.
Tranche 6: Cash payment of $250,000 on or before September 30, 2021, which was received on September 10, 2021, and fulfilled the cash
option payment requirement per the original agreement.
Tranche 7: Commencing from September 10, 2021, BeMetals shall fund and complete a surface drilling exploration program with a
minimum of 7,000 feet. Including but not limited to corresponding sampling and analysis.
Tranche 8: Upon BeMetal's intention to exercise their option, and completion of Tranches 1 through 7. An additional payment of an amount
equal to the lesser of 50% of the market capitalization of BeMetals at the time, and the greater of either $10 million; or 20% the net present
value of the South Mountain Project as calculated in the PEA and discounted at 8%. Less the sum of:
US$850,000 being the total cash payments made by BMET USA.
The Tranche 2 Shares Value $1,883,875.
The aggregate value of the South Mountain Project Liabilities, excluding reclamation and environmental liabilities.
Concurrent with the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA and SMMI entered a management contract whereby BeMetals will pay $25,000
monthly to SMMI for management services to enable BMET to perform exploration and development work with respect to the South Mountain
Project. Management service income of $ 300,000 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Management
Service income for the three months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 was $ 75,000, respectively.
BeMetals provides funding to SMMI for ongoing project expenses, including office lease payments. Under the terms of the Option Agreement,
SMMI's management provides BeMetals a request for funds monthly to cover the upcoming month's expenses. For the years ended December 31,
2021, and 2020 BeMetals spent respectively $1,472,076 and $1,732,027 on exploration of the South Mountain Mines property.

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
6

COVID-19
Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the future impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on Thunder Mountain Gold's business is uncertain and difficult to predict. The rapid spread of the outbreak caused significant
disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and capital markets during 2020, and the impact is expected to continue to be significant during 2021.
Such economic disruptions could have a material adverse effect on Thunder Mountain Gold business due to the negative financial impact.
The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related government responses could have disruptions to the "BeMetals Option
Agreement. If BeMetals decides not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any additional payments.
The COVID-19 outbreak could have a variety of adverse impacts to the Company, including their ability to continue operations of their exploration
under the BeMetals Operation Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there were no material adverse impacts to the Company's' operations due to
COVID-19.
Our business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks. This is particularly true since we are in the business of conducting
exploration for mineral properties that have the potential for discovery of economic mineral resources. We urge you to consider the following risk
factors in addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have limited income and resources.
The Company has historically incurred losses, however, under the BeMetals Option Agreement, the Company now has a recurring source of
revenue, and recorded net income in 2020, and 2019. The Company`s ability to continue as a going concern is no longer just dependent on equity
capital raises and borrowings. In 2019 in connection with the BeMetals Option Agreement (see Note 3), the Company received 10,000,000 shares
of BeMetals Corp. common stock that had a fair value of $1,883,875. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the shares is $1,520,684, and the
shares are unrestricted. The Company does have the option of selling these shares. The Company continues to have the ability to raise capital in
order to fund its future exploration and working capital requirements. The Company's plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern may
include financing the Company's future operations through sales of its common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of its
mining properties.
There is no guarantee that funds would be available from either source. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional funds, we will not be able to
develop our properties and will be forced to liquidate assets.
We have no proven reserves.
We have no proven reserves at any of our properties. We only have measured, indicated and inferred, along with assay samples at South Mountain;
and assay samples at some of our other exploration properties.
We believe we have the ability to continue as a going concern.
The liquidity of the Company was enhanced on February 27, 2019, when the Company entered the BeMetals Option Agreement with BeMetals
Corp., and BMET USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals. Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to
purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of SMMI from TMRI, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The term of the
agreement is for two years with BeMetals completing a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") completed by a mutually agreed third-party
engineering firm. Through December 31, 2021, cash proceeds of $1,100,000 and $250,000 in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock
have been received. BeMetals also agreed to pay the Company $25,000 per month for management services. In the event that BeMetals decides
not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any additional payments.
Additional sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of our stock, or alternative methods
such as mergers or sale of our assets. The Company received 10,000,000 shares of BeMetals Corp. common stock in connection with the BeMetals
Option Agreement. On May 17, 2021, the Company received US $649,557 from the sale of 2,000,000 shares of BeMetals common stock in an
arranged transaction through Canaccord Genuity at a price of US $0.325 ($CAD 0.40) per share. Currently, there remains 8,000,000 of BeMetals
common stock shares being held at Canaccord Genuity in connection with the BeMetals Option Agreement. (See South Mountain Project above),
This sale meets the requirements for sale under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement.
7

Based upon current plans, Thunder Mountain Gold management is confident that the Company will have the financial strength and opportunities to
meet its financial obligations for the next 12 months. Factors considered substantiating this conclusion include:
A. The Option Agreement for the South Mountain Project with BeMetals Corp. positions the Company for cash infusions, as well as equity
considerations, that will more than cover the Company`s financial obligations for the next 12 months, and
B. The ability to raise additional equity capital based upon the success of the exploration and development conducted by BeMetals during this
option period, and
C. The Officers of the Company and their willingness to fund any liabilities not currently covered by the Company, and finally,
D. In 2019 in connection with the BeMetals Option Agreement (see Note 3), the Company received 10,000,000 shares of BeMetals Corp.
common stock that had a fair value of $1,883,875. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the shares is $1,520,684.
While there is much work to do, it is important to note that if BeMetals decides not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not
be obligated to make any additional payments. In that event, we will immediately commence with marketing the Project to other groups that have
an interest in the Project.
We believe we have the ability to continue as a going concern, even though our total accumulated deficit of $5,106,642 as of December 31, 2021.
Our plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt
and the eventual profitable exploitation of our mining properties. The Company does have the option of selling BeMetals common stock shares. If
we are not successful with our plans, equity holders could then lose all or a substantial portion of their investment.
At December 31, 2021, we had current assets of $1,175,012. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used for operating activities was
$257,816. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including timing, cost and progress of our exploration efforts,
our evaluation of, and decisions with respect to, our strategic alternatives, and costs associated with the regulatory approvals. If it turns out that
we do not have enough cash to complete our exploration programs, we will make every effort to raise additional funds from public offerings, sale of
liquid stock or loans.
Our exploration efforts may be adversely affected by metals price volatility causing us to cease exploration efforts.
The success of any exploration efforts is derived from the price of metal prices that are affected by numerous factors including: 1) expectations for
inflation; 2) investor speculative activities; 3) relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies; 4) global and regional demand and
production; 5) global and regional political and economic conditions; and 6) production costs in major producing regions. These factors are beyond
our control and are impossible for us to predict.
There is no guarantee that current favorable prices for metals and other commodities will be sustained. If the market prices for these commodities
weaken, we will temporarily suspend or cease exploration efforts.
The BeMetals Option Agreement may be adversely affected by exploration results, or adversely affected by metals price volatility
causing us to cease exploration efforts. Consideration to be received by the Company is highly contingent upon future events.
There is no guarantee that the BeMetals Option Agreement will be exercised. This Agreement, and associated payments to the Company, are a
contingent consideration, and may be terminated at any time by BeMetals during the Option period. The completion and exercise of the BeMetals
Option Agreement is affected by the success of BeMetals exploration efforts and is contingent upon 1) certain conditions precedent; 2) the price of
metals that are affected by numerous factors including inflation, investor speculative activities, relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other
currencies, global and regional demand and production, global and regional political and economic conditions, and production costs in major
producing regions. These factors are beyond our control and are impossible for us to predict.
8

There is no guarantee that the BeMetals consideration shares, in the event BeMetals Corp. elects to use its shares as consideration, that may be
issued to the Company will be tradeable or liquid, and the future valuation is subject to significant uncertainty and cannot be determined at this
time. The amount of consideration shares is dependent upon the results of BeMetals Corp. exploration results, and the corresponding Preliminary
Economic Analysis (PEA) that BeMetals Corp. will produce. The Company will provide additional information to shareholders of the Company
regarding the BeMetals Option Agreement in either a Schedule 14A proxy circular or a Schedule 14C information statement to be prepared in
connection with obtaining the required shareholder approval to the BeMetals Option Agreement.
There is no guarantee that current prices for metals and other commodities will be sustained. If the market prices for these commodities weaken,
then the BeMetals Option Agreement may not be exercised.
Our mineral exploration efforts may not be successful.
Mineral exploration is highly speculative. It involves many risks and often does not produce positive results. Even if we find a valuable mineral
deposit, it may take many additional years or more before production is possible because of the need for additional detailed exploration, pre-
production studies, permitting, financing, construction and start up.
During that time, it may not be economically feasible to produce those minerals. Establishing ore reserves requires us to make substantial capital
expenditures and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result of these costs and uncertainties, we will
not be able to develop any potentially economic mineral deposits.
We face strong competition from other mining companies for the acquisition of new properties.
If we do find an economic mineral reserve, and it is put into production, it should be noted that mines have limited lives and as a result, we need to
continually seek to find new properties. In addition, there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the United States or elsewhere
where we would consider conducting exploration activities. Because we face strong competition for new properties from other exploration and
mining companies, some of whom have greater financial resources than we do, we may be unable to acquire attractive new mining properties on
terms that we consider acceptable.
Mining operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry.
Mining operations involve a number of risks and hazards including: 1) environmental hazards; 2) political and country risks; 3) industrial accidents;
4) labor disputes; 5) unusual or unexpected geologic formations; 6) high wall failures, cave-ins or explosive rock failures, and; 7) flooding and
periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. Such risks could result in: 1) damage to or destruction of mineral
properties or producing facilities; 2) personal injury; 3) environmental damage; 4) delays in exploration efforts; 5) monetary losses, and; 6) legal
liability.
We have no insurance against any of these risks. To the extent we are subject to environmental liabilities, we would have to pay for these liabilities.
Moreover, in the event that we ever become an operator of a mine, and unable to fully pay for the cost of remedying an environmental problem,
should it occur, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into other interim compliance measures.
Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our exploration. This may prevent us from realizing any revenues,
thus reducing the value of the stock.
Because our Company is small and does not have much capital, we must limit the time and money we expend on exploration of interests in our
properties. In particular, we may not be able to: 1) devote the time we would like to explore our properties; 2) spend as much money as we would
like to exploring our properties; 3) rent the quality of equipment or hire the contractors we would like to have for exploration; and 4) have the
number of people working on our properties that we would like to have. By limiting our operations, it may take longer to explore our properties.
There are other larger exploration companies that could and may spend more time and money exploring the properties that we have acquired.
9

We will have to suspend our exploration plans if we do not have access to all the supplies and materials we need.
Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies. We have not attempted
to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products, equipment or materials. We will attempt to locate products, equipment and materials after we
have conducted preliminary exploration activities on our properties. If we cannot find the products and equipment we need in a timely manner, we
will have to delay or suspend our exploration plans until we do find the products and equipment we need.
We face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risks, which could prevent us from exploring or developing our
properties.
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing mining exploration development, production, labor
standards, occupational health, waste disposal, use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, mine safety and other matters. New legislation
and regulations may be adopted at any time that results in additional operating expense, capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the
exploration, mining, production or development of our properties.
The Company has accrued $65,000 Accrued Reclamation costs regarding the South Mountain Mine project. Various laws and permits require that
financial assurances be in place for certain environmental and reclamation obligations and other potential liabilities. Once we undertake any
trenching or drilling activities, a reclamation bond and a permit will be required under applicable laws. Currently, we have no obligations for
financial assurances of any kind, and are unable to undertake any trenching, drilling, or development on any of our properties until we obtain
financial assurances pursuant to applicable regulations to cover potential liabilities.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results
accurately, which could harm our business and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny.
Internal control systems provide only reasonable assurance that fraud and errors will be detected within the normal course of operations. The
Company's management strives to maintain internal controls that are effective and commensurate for the size and scope of the business being
conducted by the Company. The Company realizes the need to be proactive in this area and continues to evaluate ways for improving internal
controls that are practical and cost effective for the size, structure, and future existence of our organization. The Company's Chief Financial
Officer initiates and records all transactions. The transactions are reviewed and approved by the Company's President and CEO and reviewed by
the Company's Vice President and COO. Capital Items and expenditures more than $5,000 must be approved by the Board of Directors, even if it is
a line item in a Board Approved Budget. In addition, The Company has a Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") which is
acknowledged by officers and directors. This Corporate Governance applies to Thunder Mountain Gold Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company").

The current land package at South Mountain consists of 17 patented mining claims encompassing approximately 326 acres, 21 unpatented mining
lode claims covering approximately 290 acres, and approximately 489 acres of leased private land. In addition, the project owns 360 acres of
private land (mill site) not contiguous with the mining claims.
All holdings are in the South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho.
The Company's plan of operation for the next twelve months, subject to business conditions, will be to continue to advance the South Mountain
Project under the BeMetals Option Agreement, including continued baseline environmental and engineering work necessary to complete a
Preliminary Economic Analysis. As time permits, the Company may work on advancing the Trout Creek gold project, Lander County, Nevada.
The South Mountain Project
South Mountain is a polymetallic development project focused on high-grade zinc and silver. It is located approximately 70 miles southwest of
Boise, Idaho (see Figure 2). The Project was intermittently mined from the late 1800s to the late 1960s and its existing underground workings
remain intact and well maintained. Historic production at the Project has largely come from high-grade massive sulfide bodies that remain open at
depth and along strike. According to historical smelter records, approximately 53,642 tons of mineralized material has been mined to date. These
records also indicate average grades; 14.5% Zn, 11.63 opt Ag, 0.063 opt Au, 2.4% Pb, and 1.4% Cu were mined. Thunder Mountain Gold Inc.
purchased and advanced the Project from 2007 through 2019 investing approximately US$12M during that period. The current mineral resource
estimate of the deposit is detailed in Table 3 below and the Company expects to provide a revised mineral resource update following a phase 2
drilling program in 2020.
The Project is largely on and surrounded by private surface land, and as such, the permitting and environmental aspects of the Project are expected
to be straightforward. Permits are currently in place for underground exploration activities.

South Mountain Project - BeMetals Option Agreement
Under the BeMetals Corporation (TSX-V: BMET) Option Agreement, BeMetals and Thunder Mountain Gold formed a project team early in 2019
that is focused on advancing the South Mountain Project. This Boise Idaho-based team includes key management of Thunder Mountain Gold Inc.,
who have coordinated re-establishment of the Project site prior to the start of drilling. In addition, BeMetals appointed a project manager and
project geologist for this team, along with technical and underground support.
With the help of Thunder Mountain Gold, BeMetals (BMET) commenced drilling at South Mountain in July of 2019 and drilled twenty-one holes
totaling 7,517 feet (2,290 meters) from five underground drilling stations within the Sonneman level. The drilling program was designed to test
potential down plunge extensions, and overall continuity to the mineralized zones and confirm the grade distribution of the current polymetallic
mineral resource. All of the drill core recovered from the drilling was logged on site and assayed by ALS Chemex. Selected intervals and results are
summarized in the Company`s 2020 Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in the 2019 Form 10K for the year ended December 31,
2019.
On September 21, 2021, the Company agreed to an extension of the Option Agreement with BeMetals Corp. The Extension is through the 2022
calendar year, with the same terms to acquire up to a 100% interest in the South Mountain Project in southwest Idaho, U.S.A. In exchange for the
Extension, BeMetals paid the Company the Tranche 6 Payment of $250,000.
2021 PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS - SOUTH MOUNTAIN PROJECT
In May of 2021, BeMetals Corp. completed an updated Mineral Resource Estimate ("MRE"), incorporating results from Phase 1 and 2 underground
diamond drilling programs at the South Mountain Project. The updated MRE includes a substantially increased resource for the Project while
maintaining the high-grade nature of the mineralization.
The updated Independent MRE, which has an effective date of April 20, 2021, was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI-43-101") by Hard Rock Consulting, LLC, based in the U.S.A. More details are included in Tables
1 & 2 below and a technical report for this MRE was filed with SEDAR, and on the Company's website, within 45 days from the date of this news
release.
After signing the Option Agreement Extension, BeMetals Corp. embarked on a phase 3 program at South Mountain with the objective to
significantly expand the scale of the current Mineral Resource Estimate ("MRE") at South Mountain (See Summary of the MRE below), testing and
establishing the down depth extent of mineralization on the DMEA zone. The DMEA Zone is the largest known body of mineralization on the
Property, containing the majority of tonnage in the current MRE, and the mineralized zone remains open at depth.
Based on the last two phases of underground drilling and all the historical exploration data available, we are confident that there is strong potential
to substantially expand the down-plunge extensions of the mineral resource with this new phase of surface drilling at the Property. The plan is to
initially complete approximately 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) of surface core drilling in this phase of exploration. Assuming this exploration program is
successful, the plan is to update the current MRE and complete an ongoing Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Project in 2022.
By December of 2021, 2 surface core holes had been drilled for a combined total of 3,600 feet. Results are currently being modeled.

HIGHLIGHTS OF UPDATED MINERAL RESOURCE
Measured & Indicated ("M&I"): 206,900 tons grading 9.63% Zinc ("Zn"), 4.41 ounces per ton ("opt") Silver ("Ag"), 0.064 opt
Gold ("Au"), 1.01% Lead ("Pb") and 0.63% Copper ("Cu").
This represents a 21.8% increase to the M&I tonnage from the historical 2019 MRE with a 20.36% Zn equivalent grade
("ZnEq").
Inferred: 833,700 tons grading 7.63% Zn, 5.72 opt Ag, 0.041 opt Au, 0.97% Pb and 0.81% Cu.
This represents a 129.5% increase in the Inferred tonnage from the historical 2019 MRE with an 18.10% ZnEq.
Note: See Table 1 and 2 footnotes section 4 for details of the Zn equivalent grade calculation
MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE
In two phases of drilling completed during 2019 and 2020 a combined total of approximately 16,000 feet of underground core drilling was
completed at South Mountain. During these drilling campaigns, our site team also widened and advanced the existing Sonneman level eastwards by
170 feet to establish a new drill station closer to the Texas Zone. All the results of this drilling have now been in incorporated into the updated MRE
for the South Mountain deposit.
Tables 1 & 2 below provide the Mineral Resource Statement for the Project in U.S. and Metric units respectively with details of the modelling
methodology and cut-off grades applied to the mineral resource. Figure 1 illustrates the principal areas where the South Mountain deposit has
been expanded from the historical MRE that was completed in 2019. The historical Technical Report for the Mineral Resource Estimate for the
South Mountain Project Owyhee County, Idaho USA Report Date: Dated: April 1, 2019 is filed on SEDAR.

1.) The effective date of the mineral resource estimate is April 20th, 2021. The QP for the estimate is Mr. Richard A. Schwering, P.G., SME-RM, of
Hard Rock Consulting, LLC. and is independent of BeMetals Corp., Thunder Mountain Gold Inc., and South Mountain Mines Inc.
2.) Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability such as diluting materials and allowances for
losses that may occur when material is mined or extracted; or modifying factors including but not restricted to mining, processing, metallurgical,
infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Inferred mineral resources may not be converted to
mineral reserves. It is reasonably expected, though not guaranteed, that the majority of Inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to
Indicated mineral resources with continued exploration.
3.) The mineral resource is reported at an underground mining cutoff of $102.5 U.S. Net Smelter Return ("NSR") within coherent wireframe
models. The NSR calculation and cut-off is based on the following assumptions: an Au price of $1,750/oz, Ag price of $23.00/oz, Pb price of
$1.02/lb., Zn price of $1.20/lb. and Cu price of $3.40/lb.; Massive Sulfide ore type metallurgical recoveries and payables of 52.25% for Au,
71.25% for Ag, 71.40% for Zn, 66.50% for Pb, and 49.00% for Cu and a total smelter cost of $33.29; Skarn ore type metallurgical recoveries and
payables of 71.25% for Au, 80.75% for Ag, 51.00% for Zn, 47.50% for Pb, and 87.70% for Cu and a smelter cost of $7.24; assumed mining cost of
$70/ton, process costs of $25/ton, and general and administrative costs of $7.5/ton. Based on the stated prices and recoveries the NSR formula is
calculated as follows; NSR = (Ag grade * Ag price * Ag Recovery and Payable) + (Au grade * Au price * Au Recovery and Payable) + (Pb grade *
20 * Pb Price * Pb Recovery and Payable) + (Cu grade * 20 * Cu Price * Cu Recovery and Payable) + (Zn grade * 20 * Zn Price * Zn Recovery and
Payable) for each ore type.
4.) The zinc equivalent grades were calculated as Zn Grade + (((Pb Price * Pb Recovery and Payable) / (Zn Price*Zn Recovery and Payable)) * Pb
Grade) + (((Cu Price * Cu Recovery and Payable) / (Zn Price * Zn Recovery and Payable)) * Cu Grade) + (((Ag Price * Ag Recovery and Payable) /
(Zn Price * 20 * Zn Recovery and Payable)) * Ag Grade) + (((Au Price * Au Recovery and Payable) / (Zn Price * 20 * Zn Recovery and Payable)) *
Au Grade)

PHASE 2 TEXAS ZONE DRILLING - SOUTH MOUNTAIN PROJECT
A total of 8,904 feet (2,714 meters) of underground core drilling was completed during Phase 2, with 30 holes in both the Texas and DMEA zones.
During this drilling campaign, our site team widened and advanced the existing Sonneman level eastwards by 170 feet (52 meters) to establish a
new drill station closer to the Texas Zone (See Figure 1). With better access to drill the Texas Zone, a total of 24 holes were completed to test this
zone of mineralization. Geological logging of the core supported by sampling results indicate that two styles of high-grade mineralization have
developed in this area and are now identified as the Texas West and Texas East zones.
Table 1 below illustrates the drilling results received to date from the Texas West Zone. This zone is characterized by skarn-hosted, dominantly
copper and silver mineralization. This is demonstrated, for example, in the drilled intercepts:
3.81% Cu with 7.82 opt (244.3 g/t) Ag over 15.7 feet (4.79 meters) in hole SM20-043 (Interval 1),
2.56% Cu with 8.32 opt (260.1 g/t) Ag over 35.6 feet (10.85 meters) in SM20-028, and
2.23% Cu with 10.81 opt (337.9 g/t) Ag over 16.96 feet (5.17 meters) in hole SM20-038.
Important to note that from the geological logging of the core, the higher copper grades over significant drilled widths in Texas West appear to be
controlled by the increased abundance of chalcopyrite, which is a common copper sulphide mineral, often extractable through conventional
flotation methods. Representative sample material of this and other zones of the deposit have been identified and are being collected for
metallurgical test work at the SGS Mineral Services site in Lakefield, Canada. Results from this study will be included with historical test work and
incorporated into the planned PEA study later this year.
Table 2 below displays the drill hole intersections from the Texas East Zone where this mineralization is represented by predominantly massive
sulphide hosted zinc, silver, and gold mineralization. Examples of this style of mineralization are intercepts:
8.65% Zn, 6.98 opt (218.1 g/t) Ag and 0.078 opt (2.44 g/t) Au over 11 feet (3.37 meters) in hole SM20-043 (Interval 2), and
4.17% Zn, 6.23 opt (194.8 g/t) Ag and 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) Au over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters) in hole SM20-050.
The gold grades of 0.130 opt (4.05 g/t) over 27.39 feet (8.35 meters); 0.066 opt (2.07 g/t) over 15.45 feet (4.71 meters) and 0.122 opt. (3.82 g/t)
over 4.39 feet (1.34 meters) in holes SM20-050, SM20-043, and SM20-029, respectively, are of specific interest from a value potential for the Texas
East Zone. These Texas East intersections represent the successful targeting and interpreted extension of mineralization below historical high-
grade rib sampling in the Sonneman level from the 1980s (See Figure 1). (See Thunder Mountain Gold news release, dated; January 27, 2020).
The 2020 drill program intersected mineralization extending the Texas Zone further down dip of historical drilling and the exposures in the
underground development. Texas Zone mineralization is now interpreted to continue from the collar of the old Texas Shaft some 1,150 feet (350
meters) down dip to the SM20-050 intercept. Both the Texas West and East zones remain open to depth (See Figure 1). Table 3 further below
provides drill hole azimuth, dip, end of hole length and collar coordinates for each of the reported drill holes.

Phase I Drilling at South Mountain under BeMetals Option Agreement
The principal objectives of the Phase 1 work plan at South Mountain were to test for potential extensions of the mineralized zones and confirm the
grade distribution of the current polymetallic mineral resource estimate. The Company has now successfully completed the phase 1 program
comprised of 20 underground drill holes for a total of approximately 2,290 meters. Geological logging and sampling of all drill holes have now been
completed with all analytical results received. These results have been compiled into the Project's geological database and were used to design the
phase 2 drilling program for 2020. Following the phase 2 drilling program, all new results were integrated into an updated mineral resource
estimation for the Project and announced during the second quarter of 2021.

Note: Reported widths in tables 1 & 2 are drilled core lengths as true widths are unknown at this time. It is estimated based upon current data that
true widths might range between 60-80% of the drilled intersection. For drill holes SM19-017* and SM19-018* true widths are unknown as these
are the first drill intersections of the MD4 target. Intervals cut offs are based upon visual contacts of massive sulfide units with no more than 1.75
meters of internal skarn. For SM19-010 a nominal 0.5% copper cut off has been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections for this
skarn hosted mineralization with no more than 1.4m of internal dilution. For SM19-016† (intervals 1, 3 and 4) a nominal 0.46 g/t gold cut off has
been applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections with no internal dilution. For SM19-017 & 018 a nominal 2.4% zinc cut off has been
applied to determine the boundaries of the intersections for this skarn hosted mineralization with no more than 2m of internal dilution. (Note: See
details below in QA/QC section). 1.00 meter (m) is equal to 3.28 feet (ft). One gram per tonne (g/t) is equal to 0.032 ounces per ton (oz/t, or o.p.t.).
The above drill holes returned significant intersections of both massive sulfide and skarn styles of mineralization. Important sulfide minerals are
pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. During the planned phase 3 campaign at South Mountain, the Company will carry out
mineralogy and metallurgical test work studies to confirm historical other previous high-grade results, which will be included in the PEA.

Underground core drilling was conducted to extend and upgrade the South Mountain resource - testing the continuity and down-dip extensions of
the high-grade polymetallic massive sulfide zones. The Company and BeMetals completed additional core drilling in the DMEA and Laxey zones to
complete the confirmation and extensional drilling in 2021. The Company also retrieved bulk samples for metallurgical test work.
More than 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) have been drilled at South Mountain and included in the model. The South Mountain historic ore zones
remain open down-dip on the zones encountered. The successful drilling and development work prove that the South Mountain resource continues
to grow with potential to increase the resource substantially.

South Mountain Mine History
The limited historic production peaked during World War II when, based on smelter receipts, the production of direct shipped ore totaled as
follows:
Metal Grade Total Metal
Zinc 14.5% 15,593,100 lbs (7,072,900 Kg)
Silver 10.6 opt (363.4 g/t) 566,440 ozs (17,618,200 grams)
Gold 0.058 opt (1.99 g/t) 3,120 ozs (96,980 grams)
Copper 1.4% 1,485,200 lbs (6,320 Kg)
Lead 2.4% 2,562,300 lbs (1,162,250 Kg)
Anaconda Smelter - Toole Utah - Crude Ore Shipment Head Grades
1941-1953 Total Tons: 53,653 (48,670 tonnes)
In addition to the direct-ship ore, a flotation mill was constructed and operated during the late-1940s and early-1950s. From the 1954 South
Mountain Mill report, recoveries were reported as follows:
1954 South Mountain Mill Report
Metal Head Grades Recovery
Zinc 6.7% 80%
Silver 17.5 opt (600 g/t) 85%
Gold 0.02 opt (0.7 g/t) 75%
Copper 3.2% 90%
Lead 1% 90%
These are historic grades and recoveries not confirmed by the Company, but reportedly
mined from a small 39,600-ton (35,900 tonnes) copper rich block in the Texas zone.
South Mountain Mines Inc. (an Idaho Corporation) owned the patented claims from 1975 to the time the Company purchased the entity in 2007.
They conducted extensive exploration work including extending the Sonneman Level by approximately 1,500 feet to intercept the down-dip
extension of the Texas sulfide mineralization mined on the Laxey Level approximately 400 feet up-dip from the Sonneman. High grade sulfide
mineralization was intercepted and confirmed on the Sonneman Extension. In 1985 South Mountain Mines Inc. completed a feasibility study based
on historic and newly developed ore zones exposed in their underground workings and drilling. Although they determined positive economics, and
that the resource was still open at depth with a large upside potential, the project was idled and placed into care and maintenance.
In 2008, the Company contracted Kleinfelder, Inc., a nationwide engineering and consulting firm, to complete a technical report "Resources Data
Evaluation, South Mountain Property, South Mountain Mining District, Owyhee County, Idaho". The technical report was commissioned by Thunder
Mountain Resources, Inc. to evaluate all the existing data available on the South Mountain property. Kleinfelder utilized a panel modeling method
using this data to determine potential mineralized material remaining and to make a comparison with the resource determined by South Mountain
Mines in the mid-1980s. Kleinfelder's calculations provided a potential resource that is consistent with South Mountain Mines' (Bowes 1985)
historic reserve model.
In 2009, the Company contracted a third-party consulting firm that incorporated all the new drill and sampling data into an NI 43-101 Technical
Report. This report was completed as part of the Company's dual listing on the TSX Venture Exchange in 2010. The Company is also traded in the
U.S. on the OTCQB under ticker THMG.
In January of 2018, the Company engaged Hard Rock Consulting LLC (HRC) from Denver, Colorado to update the South Mountain Project 43-101.
HRC concluded that significant potential exists to increase the known mineral resource with additional drilling, as well as to upgrade existing
mineral resource classifications with additional infill drilling. HRC also determined that the conceptual geologic model is sound, and, in
conjunction with drilling results, indicates that mineralization is essentially open in all directions, and is continuous between underground levels
and extends to the surface.
24

Hard Rock Consulting also noted that:
THMG technical staff has thorough understanding of the geology of the South Mountain Project, and that the appropriate deposit model is
being applied for exploration.
Because the Project is largely located on and surrounded by private land, it greatly simplifies Project approvals compared to mining projects
involving public lands.
Initial metallurgical testing demonstrates that the South Mountain massive sulfide mineralization is amenable to differential flotation and
concentration.
The current mineral resource at the South Mountain Project is more than sufficient to warrant continued planning and development to
further advance the Project.
Gold Breccia
HRC also reviewed the data on the anomalous gold-bearing multi-lithic breccia that was identified by THMG conducting reconnaissance work at
South Mountain. In 2010, five holes were drilled in the anomaly for a total footage of 3,530 feet, and 705 total samples taken every five feet of drill
hole. Of the 705 samples taken, 686 samples contained anomalous gold, or 97% of the samples. The highest-grade intercept ran 0.038 ounce per
ton. HRC reviewed the reports done on the breccia completed by both Kinross and Newmont; of note was Newmont's comparison of the geology to
the Battle Mountain Complex in Nevada.
The Technical Report was authored by Ms. J.J. Brown, P.G., SME-RM, Mr. Jeffrey Choquette, P.E., and Mr. Randy Martin, SME-RM, all of Hard
Rock Consulting, each of whom is an independent qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 The NI 43-101 Technical Report has an effective
date of April 7, 2018 and has been filed in Canada on SEDAR in accordance with NI 43-101. The Report can be reviewed on the Company`s
website at www.thundermountaingold.com.
Note to United States investors concerning estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources.
Information concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
subpart 1300 of Regulation SK, which first became applicable to us for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. These requirements differ
significantly from the previously applicable disclosure requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7. Among other differences, subpart 1300 of Regulation
S-K requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year both
in the aggregate and for each of our individually material mining properties. You are cautioned that mineral resources do not have demonstrated
economic value. Mineral resources are subject to further exploration and development, are subject to additional risks, and no assurance can be
given that they will eventually convert to future reserves. Inferred Resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence
and their economic and legal feasibility. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the Inferred Resource exists or is economically
or legally mineable. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Disclosure of the NI-43-101 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, including Canadian National
Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). The Highlights of South Mountain NI-43-101 section refers to "mineral resources," "measured mineral
resources," "indicated mineral resources," and "inferred mineral resources."
Qualified Person - The technical information in this Form 10K has been reviewed and approved by Larry D. Kornze, Retired, , Qualified Person,
and Director of Thunder Mountain Gold Inc., and a "Qualified Person" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 standards.
This property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature according to Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of the
SEC`s Industry Guide 7. There are currently no permits required for conducting exploration in accordance with the Company`s current board
approved exploration plan.

Trout Creek Project, Lander County, Nevada
The Trout Creek project is a highly prospective gold exploration target located along the western flank of the Shoshone Mountain Range in the
Reese River Valley in Lander County, Nevada. The Project is located approximately 155 air miles northeast of Reno, Nevada, or approximately 20
miles south of Battle Mountain, Nevada, in Sections 10, 11, 14, 16, 21, 22, 27; T.29N.; R.44E. Mount Diablo Baseline & Meridian, Lander County,
Nevada. Latitude: 40 23' 36" North, Longitude: 117 00' 58" West. The property is generally accessible year-round by traveling south from Battle
Mountain Nevada on state highway 305, which is paved.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made the decision not to maintain 52 unpatented mining claims (1,067 acres) of the original
87 unpatented mining claims in the Trout Creek area. The Company has retained 26 unpatented mining claims (approximately 520 acres). The
Company's 26 unpatented mining claims are situated along a recognizable structural zone in the Eureka-Battle Mountain mineralized gold trend.
The Company paid annual fees to BLM of $4,290 and Lander County $324 fees.
The Trout Creek target is anchored by a regional gravity anomaly on a well-defined northwest-southeast trending break in the alluvial fill thickness
and underlying bedrock. Previous geophysical work in the 1980s revealed an airborne magnetic anomaly associated with the same structure, and
this was further verified and outlined in 2008 by Company personnel, with consultation from Jim Wright - Wright Geophysics using a ground
magnetometer. The target is covered by alluvial fan deposits of generally unknown thickness, shed from the adjacent Shoshone Range, a fault block
mountain range composed of Paleozoic sediments of both upper and lower plate rocks of the Roberts Mountains thrust.
In addition to the geologic fieldwork, Wright Geophysics conducted a ground gravity survey and CSMAT over the pediment target area and this
provided insight into the gravel-bedrock contact as well as defining the favorable structural setting within the buried bedrock. An untested drill
target was identified under the gravel pediment along these structures, and the geophysics showed that the bedrock was within 500 feet of the
surface, which is reasonable depth for exploration drilling and potential mining if a significant mineralization is encountered.
Because the project is surrounded by Newmont Mining`s land package, Thunder Mountain signed a joint venture agreement with Newmont Mining
on some of their adjoining mineral rights sections and aliquot parcels from 2011 thru 2016. On October 27, 2016 the Company terminated the
exploration agreement with Newmont Mining Corporation to concentrate their efforts on the South Mountain Project.
The Company does not plan to conduct any work on the Trout Creek Property in 2022, but instead will focus all of their efforts on their South
Mountain Project.
There are currently no environmental permits required for the planned exploration work on the property. In the future, a notice of intent may be
required with the Bureau of Land Management. See My Email RE SEC's change to Guide 7.
Competition
We are an exploration stage company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the
acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater
financial and technical resources than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral
properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to
afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having
mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This
competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our
mineral properties.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans:
On July 17, 2011, the Company Shareholders approved the Company`s Stock Incentive Plan (SIP). The SIP has a fixed maximum percentage of 10%
of the Company's outstanding shares that are eligible for the plan pool, whereby the number of Shares under the SIP increase automatically with
increases in the total number of shares. This "Evergreen" provision permits the reloading of shares that make up the available pool for the SIP,
once the options granted have been exercised. The number of shares available for issuance under the SIP automatically increases as the total
number of shares outstanding increase, including those shares issued upon exercise of options granted under the SIP, which become re-available
for grant after exercise of option grants. The number of shares subject to the SIP and any outstanding awards under the SIP will be adjusted
appropriately by the Board of Directors if the Company's common stock is affected through a reorganization, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification, dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends) or other distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of
substantially all the Company's assets.
The SIP also has terms and limitations, including without limitation that the exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights granted
under the SIP must equal the stock's fair market value, based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option or stock
appreciation right is granted. The SIP is also subject to other limitation including; a limited exception for certain stock options assumed in
corporate transactions; stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the SIP may not be "re-priced" without shareholder approval;
stock-based awards under the SIP are subject to either three-year or one-year minimum vesting requirements, subject to exceptions for death,
disability or termination of employment of an employee or upon a change of control; and shareholder approval is required for certain types of
amendments to the SIP.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities:
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the "BeMetals Option Agreement") with BeMetals Corp., a British
Columbia corporation ("BeMetals"), and BeMetals USA Corp., a Delaware corporation ("BMET USA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals.
Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, in the second quarter 2019, BeMetals purchased 2.5 million shares of the Company's common
stock at a price of $0.10 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000, in a private placement. Use of proceeds are for general corporate
working capital. This private placement was approved by the TSX-V.
ITEM 6 - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
Not required for smaller reporting companies.
ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader
understand our financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the
accompanying integral notes ("Notes") thereto. The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ materially.
Plan of Operation:
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: inability to locate property with mineralization, lack
of financing for exploration efforts, competition to acquire mining properties; risks inherent in the mining industry, and risk factors that are listed
in the Company's reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company re-started the advancement of the South Mountain Project in 2019 with BeMetals Corp. - Vancouver B.C. (TSX-V: BMET) - under an
option agreement to complete the pre-development work and produce a preliminary economic analysis (PEA). The Company's plan of operation for
the next twelve months is to continue supporting BeMetals Corp. during their option period and help ensure that the South Mountain PEA is
completed on schedule and within budget.
28

Results of Operations:
In 2021, the Company recorded a net loss of $571,796, or $0.01 per share compared to a net income of $1,216,682, or $0.02 per share for the same
period of 2020. The net loss is primarily due to the unrealized loss on its investment in BeMetals Corp. common stock of $941,079.. During the
year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had an unrealized gain of $1,282,804 on its investment in BeMetals Corp. common stock. On May 4,
2021, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of BeMetals Corp. common stock for US $649,557 ($CAD 800,000) (see Footnote 4).
Fourth Quarter comparisons
Total revenue for the quarter ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $75,000 in management services income. Total operating expenses for the
three months ending December 31, 2021 of $102,320 decreased from the same respective time period in 2020 by $6,530 or 6%. Legal and
accounting costs increased in three-month period ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 by $6,371 for a total of $16,615. The increase in
legal and accounting costs is principally due cost associated with the BeMetals Lease Option Agreement. Management and administrative expense
decreased by $7,590 or 7% to $87,884 compared to $95,478 for the same period last year. Exploration, Depreciation expense remained consistent
with the prior year.
Year end comparisons December 31,2021-2020
Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $250,000, or 45%, to $800,000 compared with $550,000 in the same period last
year, While management service income remained consistent at $300,000 for both years, the gain on mineral interest increased to $500,000 as a
result of payments receive pursuant to the terms of the Be Metals option agreement.
Total operating expenses for the period ending December 31, 2021 of $526,982 decreased from the year ending December 31, 2020 by $119,700 or
19%. Exploration expenses remained consistent with the prior year while legal and accounting expenses increased. Legal and accounting costs
increased $28,966 to $85,309, an increase of 51%, compared with $56,343 in prior year. The increase is the result of additional legal expenses
associated with the amendment to the BeMetals option agreement that was executed during the year. Management and administrative expense
decreased by $129,089, or 23%, to $428,982 from $558,071 in the prior year due to a reduction in stock compensation expense recognized. The
Company has not recognized any stock compensation in the year ending December 31, 2021 compared with $159,740 in 2020 related to the grant
of stock options to officers and directors. Depreciation expense continued to decrease as the Company's fixed assets are almost all fully
depreciated.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a
going concern. Such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, we have sufficient cash reserves to cover normal operating
expenditures for the following 12 months.
The liquidity of the Company was enhanced on February 27, 2019 when the Company entered into the BeMetals Option Agreement with BeMetals
Corp., and BMET USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals. Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to
purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of SMMI from TMRI, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The term of the
agreement is for two years with BeMetals completing a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") completed by a mutually agreed third-party
engineering firm. Over its term, this agreement requires cash payments to the Company of $1,350,000; $1,100,000 in cash and $250,000 in
exchange for shares of the Company's common stock. Through December 31, 2021, cash proceeds of $1,100,000 and $250,000 in exchange for
shares of the Company's common stock have been received. BeMetals also agreed to pay the Company $25,000 per month for management
services. In the event that BeMetals decides not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any additional
payments. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 BeMetals spent respectively $1,472,076 and $1,732,027on exploration of the South
Mountain Mines property.
29

On July 19,2021, management and certain Directors exercised options for 710,000 common shares at a price of $0.10 per share for total proceeds
of $71,000 of which $35.534 was for cash and a $35,466 reduction in current liabilities related to advances from related parties for funds advanced
by management and foregone wages.
On May 4, 2021, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares held in BeMetals Corp. for US $649,557 ($CAD 800,000). The shares of common stock were
sold through Canaccord Genuity at a price of US $0.325 ($CAD 0.40). This sale meets the requirements under the terms of the BeMetals Option
Agreement, record a realized gain of $92,685, on the sale of BeMetals shares (see Footnote 4).
In April 2020, the Company received a loan of $48,000 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP") under Division A, Title I, Section
1102 and 1106 of the CARES Act. The loan, which was in the form of a promissory note, as amended, dated April 21, 2020 issued by the Company
(the "Note"); the Note matures on April 13, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum, payable monthly commencing on August 13, 2021.
The Note may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Under the terms of the PPP, certain amounts
of the loan may be forgiven if they are used for qualifying expenses.
On October 21, 2020, the Company completed its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness application with Washington Trust Bank. On
November 07, 2020, the Company received a notice that our loan was paid in full by the Small Business Administration, and the PPP loan was
forgiven.
The Company has historically incurred losses, however, under the BeMetals Option Agreement, the Company now has a recurring source of
revenue, and its ability to continue as a going concern is no longer dependent on equity capital raises and borrowings. However, the Company
believes it has the ability to raise capital in order to fund its future exploration and working capital requirements if necessary.
Potential additional sources of cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of our stock, or alternative methods such as mergers or sale
of 8,000,000 BeMetals common stock shares held by the company. (See South Mountain Project above), No assurances can be given, however, that
we will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash.
Our plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt
and the potential exploitation of our mining properties. Our plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures
with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in
return for equity in the property.
In addition to the BeMetals Corp. Option Agreement, we believe that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations because of the
following:
On February 15, 2022, we had $1,089,407 cash in our bank accounts.
We do not include in this consideration any option payments mentioned below.
Management is committed to manage expenses of all types to not exceed the on-hand cash resources of the Company at any point in
time, now or in the future.
The Company will also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, the sale of all or part of the Company`s BeMetals
Corp. (TSX-V: BMET) common shares beneficially held, and/or additional farm-out of its other exploration property.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reports net cash used by operating activities of $257,816 compared to cash used by operating
activities of 271,260 in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received $1,149,557 in cash from investing activities,
$500,000 from the sale of mineral interests for Tranches 5 and 6 of the BeMetals Option Agreement, and $649,557 in proceeds from sale of
2,000,000 shares of BeMetals common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used by financing activities was $9,274, which
included $35,534 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options $39,808 in payments on related notes payables, and $5,000 to non-controlling
interest. The Company reported a net cash increase of $882,467 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net cash increase of
$21,740 for same period in 2020.
Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including timing, cost and progress of our exploration efforts, our
evaluation of, and decisions with respect to, our strategic alternatives, and costs associated with the regulatory approvals. If it turns out that we do
not have enough cash to complete our exploration programs, we will attempt to raise additional funds from a public offering, a private placement,
mergers, farm-outs or loans.
30

Additional financing may be required in the future to fund our planned operations. We do not know whether additional financing will be available
when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional financing when necessary, we may have to delay our exploration
efforts or any property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain
of our mining claims.
Private Placement
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the "BeMetals Option Agreement") with BeMetals Corp., a British
Columbia corporation ("BeMetals"), and BeMetals USA Corp., a Delaware corporation ("BMET USA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals.
Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, in the second quarter 2019, BeMetals purchased 2.5 million shares of the Company's common
stock at a price of $0.10 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000, in a private placement. Use of proceeds are for general corporate
working capital. This private placement was approved by the TSX-V.
The offerings are believed exempt from registration pursuant to the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering under
Section 4(6) the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The securities offered, sold, and issued in connection with the private placement have not
been or are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United
States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
Contractual Obligations
During 2008 and 2009, three lease arrangements were made with landowners that own land parcels adjacent to the Company's South Mountain
patented and unpatented mining claims. The leases were for a seven-year period, with options to renew, with annual payments (based on $20 per
acre) listed in the following table. The leases have no work requirements.

additional 10 years at $30/acre after 2014.
(2) The Lowry lease has an early buy-out provision for 50% of the remaining amounts owed in the event the Company desires to drop the lease
prior to the end of the first seven-year period.
(3) OGT LLC, managed by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary SMMI, receives a $5,000 per year payment for up to 10 years, or until a $5
million capped NPI Royalty is paid.
Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified our critical accounting policies, the application of which may materially affect the financial statements, either because of the
significance of the financials statement item to which they relate, or because they require management's judgment in making estimates and
assumptions in measuring, at a specific point in time, events which will be settled in the future. The critical accounting policies, judgments and
estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below:
a) Estimates. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the
number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more
subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from
these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation
and/or financial condition.
31

b) Stock-based Compensation. The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, "Compensation - Stock
Compensation" using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of
equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued,
whichever is more reliably measurable.
c) Income Taxes. We have current income tax assets recorded in our financial statements that are based on our estimates relating to federal
and state income tax benefits. Our judgments regarding federal and state income tax rates, items that may or may not be deductible for
income tax purposes and income tax regulations themselves are critical to the Company's financial statement income tax items.
d) Investments. In a joint venture where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interest and has significant influence, the joint
venture is consolidated with the presentation of non-controlling interest. In determining whether significant influences exist, the Company
considers its participation in policy-making decisions and its representation on the venture's management committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2021and
2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we
are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Business Operations
Business Operations
ThunderMountain Gold, Inc. ("Thunder Mountain", "THMG", or "the Company") was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho
on November 9, 1935, under the name of Montgomery Mines, Inc. In April 1978, the Montgomery Mines Corporation was obtained by a group
of the Thunder Mountain property holders and changed its name to Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., with the primary goal to further develop their
holdings in the Thunder Mountain Mining District, located in Valley County, Idaho. Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. takes its name from the
Thunder Mountain Mining District, where its principal lode mining claims were located. For several years, the Company's activities were
restricted to maintaining its property position and exploration activities. During 2005, the Company sold its holdings in the Thunder Mountain
Mining District. During 2007, the Company acquired the South Mountain Mines property in southwest Idaho and initiated exploration activities
on that property, which continue today.
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the "BeMetals Option Agreement") with BeMetals Corporation. Under
the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of South
Mountain Mines, Inc. ("SMMI") from Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. ("TMRI"), both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The original
term of the agreement was for two years, but was extended on May 18, 2020 by three months. On September 14, 2021, the BeMetals Option
Agreement was amended, extending the option period to December 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and business conditions
surrounding restricted international travel, and corresponding access to capital markets. During this term, BeMetals is required to conduct a
preliminary economic assessment ("PEA"), completed by a mutually agreed third-party engineering firm. Over its term, this agreement requires
issuance of 10,000,000 million shares of BMET stock to the Company by BeMetals, and cash payments to the Company of $1,350,000:
$1,100,000 in cash and $250,000 in exchange for shares of the Company's common stock. In the event that BeMetals decides not to proceed
with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any additional payments. See Note 3 for further information.
Basis of Presentation and Going Concern
Theaccompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going
concern. The Company has historically incurred losses, however, under the BeMetals Option Agreement (Note 3), the Company now has a
recurring source of revenue, and its ability to continue as a going concern is no longer dependent on equity capital raises and borrowings.
However, if necessary, the Company continues to have the ability to raise additional capital in order to fund its future exploration and working
capital requirements. The Company's plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include operating on the cash flows and
consideration payments provided under the BeMetals Option Agreement.
COVID-19
In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its
rapid spread around the world and throughout the United States prompted many countries, including the United States, to institute restrictions
on travel, public gatherings and certain business operations. These restrictions disrupted economic activity in Thunder Mountain Gold's
business related to raising capital. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the disruption did not materially impact the Company' financial
statements. However, if the severity of the economic disruptions increase as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the negative
financial impact could be significantly greater in future periods.
The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses could also include extended disruptions to supply chains
and capital markets, reduced labor availability and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse
impacts to the Company. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 there were no material adverse impacts to the Company' operations due to COVID-
19.
38

In addition, the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 could also adversely impact the impairment risks for certain long-lived assets and
other investments. Thunder Mountain Gold evaluated these impairment considerations and determined that no such impairments had occurred
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses could have disruptions to the "BeMetals Option
Agreement". In the event, if BeMetals decides not to proceed with the South Mountain Project, BeMetals will not be obligated to make any
additional payments. The COVID-19 outbreak could have a variety of adverse impacts to the Company, including their ability to continue
operations of their exploration under the BeMetals Options Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there were no material adverse impacts to the
Company's BeMetal Options Agreement due to COVID-19.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company; its wholly owned subsidiaries, Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc.
(“TMRI”) and South Mountain Mines, Inc. (“SMMI”); and a company in which the Company owns 75% and has majority control, Owyhee Gold
Trust, LLC (“OGT”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the other investor’s 25% non-controlling, capped interest in OGT.
Intercompany accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more
significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of properties and mineral interests,
environmental remediation liabilities, deferred tax assets, and stock-based compensation. Management’s estimates and assumptions are based
on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Management service revenue is recognized when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation required under its management contract
with BeMetals. Such obligation is satisfied over time as work is performed and the Company has a contractual right to payment.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred income tax liabilities or assets at the end of each period using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the
taxes are actually paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purposes of the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be a cash equivalent.
Fair Value Measurements
When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value
measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other
observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in
earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date.
At December 31, 2021, the Company has one financial asset, investment in equity security, that is adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis for
which the fair value is determined based on Level 1 inputs as the equity security is traded on a stock exchange. The Company has no financial
liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.
39

Financial Instruments
The Company's financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investment in BeMetal's equity security and related party notes
payable, the carrying value of which approximates fair value based on the nature of those instruments.
Investments
The Company determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of acquisition and re-evaluates such determinations at each
reporting date. Equity securities that have a readily determined fair value are carried at fair value determined using Level 1 fair value
measurement inputs with the change in fair value recognized as unrealized gain (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations each
reporting period. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recognized on a specific identification basis.
Mineral Interests
The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring mineral interests, and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights and leases as incurred.
Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would
be amortized using the units-of-production method based on periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mineral interests are periodically assessed for
impairment of value and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment.
If a mineral interest is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations. Consideration received by the Company pursuant to
joint ventures or purchase option agreements is applied against the carrying value of the related mineral interest. When and if payments
received exceed the carrying value, the excess amount is recognized as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations in the period the
consideration is received
Leases
Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in
the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and
the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-
use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the
right-of-use asset results in front-loaded expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.
Investments in Joint Ventures
For companies and joint ventures where the Company holds more than 50% of the voting interests, but less than 100%, and has significant
influence, the company or joint venture is consolidated, and other investor interests are presented as noncontrolling. See Note 3 regarding the
Company’s investment in Owyhee Gold Trust. Joint Ventures in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not
control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Reclamation and Remediation
The Company’s operations have been, and are subject to, standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various governmental
agencies. The Company would record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which the Company incurred a
legal obligation for the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. A corresponding asset would also be recorded and depreciated over the life of
the asset.
40

For non-operating properties, the Company accrues costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that such
costs will be incurred, and they are reasonably estimable. Such costs are based on management's estimate of amounts expected to be incurred
when the remediation work is performed. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued $65,000 on its consolidated balance
sheets relating to estimated mine closure and reclamation costs on its South Mountain Mines property.
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, are measured at fair value and expensed in the
consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Updates Adopted
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The update
contains a number of provisions intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Adoption of this update on January 1, 2021 had no impact
on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323 and Topic 815. ASU 2020-01
which makes improvements related to accounting for certain equity securities when the equity method of accounting is applied or
discontinued, and scope considerations related to forward contracts and purchased options on certain securities. ASU 2020-01 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of this update on January 1, 2021, had no impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company is required to have dual presentation of basic earnings per share (“EPS”) and diluted EPS. The Company calculates basic earnings
(loss) per share by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. We do not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents in our basic earnings (loss) per share
calculations. Diluted earnings per share reflect potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including options and warrants that could share
in our earnings through the conversion of common shares, except where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, stock options of 3,355,000 are excluded in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their effect
would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss recognized for the year. Options are excluded because their exercise prices were greater than
the average trading price of the Company's common stock for the year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, stock options of 5,707,000 are
included in the calculation of diluted income per share.
Diluted common shares outstanding were calculated using the treasury stock method and are as follows:
December 31,
2021 2020
Weighted average number of common shares calculated using
basic net income per common share 60,384,839 60,145,579
Effect of common stock equivalents:
Stock options - 1,544,968
Weighted average number of common shares calculated using
diluted net income per common share 60,384,839 61,690,547

The Company fully reserved the deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as management of the Company cannot determine that is
more likely than not that, the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $ 8.0 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. $7.5 million of net
operating loss will expire between 2030 and 2037. $0.5 million of the losses were incurred after 2017 and can be carried forward indefinitely,
although usage of these net operating losses is limited to 80% of taxable income in the future tax year.

The Company has analyzed its filing positions in all jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns and found no positions that
would require a liability for uncertain income tax benefits to be recognized. The Company is subject to possible tax examinations for the years
2018 through 2021. Prior year tax attributes could be adjusted by taxing authorities. If applicable, the Company will deduct interest and
penalties as interest expense on the financial statements.

11. Leases
The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified
as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by
discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease
liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For
operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease
term. For finance leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset results in front-loaded expense over the
lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.
In February 2019, the Company entered into an operating lease for its office and as a result a liability and right-of-use asset of $29,617 was
recognized on the lease inception date. To calculate the liability and right of use asset, the Company utilized an 8.0% incremental borrowing
rate to discount the future rent payments of approximately $1,300 per month over the lease term of 2.0 years. The lease contains no renewal
option.
The Company renewed its office operating lease on February 1, 2022, for 12 months. The lease will begin payment month to month on January
31, 2023. Since the remaining lease term at December 31, 2022 is less than one year the Company did not recognize a right to use asset and
related lease liability on the balance sheet for the lease renewal. For the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 the Company paid $16,875
and $11,988 in lease payments, respectfully, which was reimbursed by BeMetals under the terms of the Option Agreement.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external
reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, using criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and concluded that internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, based on these criteria.
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting

the committee.
Compensation Committee:
The Purpose of the Compensation Committee is to conduct an annual review to determine whether the Company's executive compensation program

Indemnification of Directors and Officers:
The Company's By-Laws address indemnification of Directors and Officers. Nevada law provides that Nevada corporations may include within their
articles of incorporation provisions eliminating or limiting the personal liability of their directors and officers in shareholder actions brought to
obtain damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, as long as the alleged acts or omissions did not involve intentional misconduct, fraud, a
knowing violation of law or payment of dividends in violation of the Nevada statutes. Nevada law also allows Nevada corporations to include in their
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws provisions to the effect that expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action
must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred, subject to an undertaking on behalf of the officer or director that he or she will repay such
expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation because such officer or director did not act in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation.
The Company's Articles of Incorporation provide that a director or officer is not personally liable to the Company or its shareholders for damages
for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except for liability for: (i) acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or a
knowing violation of law, or (ii) the payment of distributions in violation of Nevada Revised Statutes, §78.300. In addition, Nevada Revised Statutes

Long-term Incentives:
On July 17, 2011, the shareholders approved a Stock Incentive Plan (the "SIP"). The SIP was again approved by the Shareholders on January 20,
2015, and April 25, 2017. The SIP will be administered by the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors and provides for the grant of stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and incentive awards to eligible individuals including directors,
executive officers and advisors that have furnished bona fide services to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising
transaction.
The SIP has a fixed maximum percentage of 10% of the Company's outstanding shares that are eligible for the plan pool, whereby the number of
Shares under the SIP increase automatically with increases in the total number of shares. This "Evergreen" provision permits the reloading of
shares that make up the available pool for the SIP, once the options granted have been exercised. The number of shares available for issuance
under the SIP automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase, including those shares issued upon exercise of options
granted under the SIP, which become re-available for grant subsequent to exercise of option grants. The number of shares subject to the SIP and
any outstanding awards under the SIP will be adjusted appropriately by the Board of Directors if the Company's common stock is affected through
a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification, dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends) or other
distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of substantially all of the Company's assets.
54

The SIP also has terms and limitations, including that the exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the SIP must
equal the stock's fair market value, based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option or stock appreciation right is
granted. The SIP is also subject to other limitation including; a limited exception for certain stock options assumed in corporate transactions; stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted under the SIP may not be "re-priced" without shareholder approval; stock-based awards under the
SIP are subject to either three-year or one-year minimum vesting requirements, subject to exceptions for death, disability or termination of
employment of an employee or upon a change of control; and shareholder approval is required for certain types of amendments to the SIP.
Employment Contracts:
During 2021, there were three Company employees - Eric Jones, Jim Collord, and Larry Thackery. They were employed per resolution of the Board
and other than a monthly salary, plus normal burden, there are no other contractual understandings in the resolutions. Each is reimbursed for the
use of personal office equipment and phones, and Jim and Eric are reimbursed for health insurance and related costs up to a set maximum amount,
when the Company is financially able to cover the reimbursements.
Share-Based Payments:
In March 2019 the Company granted 1,325,000 stock options to officers and directors of the Company. The options are exercisable on or before
March 25, 2024 and have an exercise price of $0.09. The fair value of the options was determined to be $117,088 using the Black Scholes model.
The options were fully vested upon grant and the entire fair value was recognized as compensation expense during the year ended December 31,
2019.
On March 27, 2020, the Company granted 1,630,000 stock options to officers and directors of the Company. The fair value of the options was
determined to be $159,740 using the Black Scholes model. The options are exercisable on or before March 29, 2025 and have an exercise price of
$0.099. The options were fully vested upon grant and the entire fair value was recognized as compensation expense during the year ended
December 31, 2020.
Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment or Change of Control
We have no plans or arrangements in respect of remuneration received or that may be received by our executive officers to compensate such
officers in the event of termination of employment (as a result of resignation or retirement) or change of control transaction.
ITEM 12 - SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
