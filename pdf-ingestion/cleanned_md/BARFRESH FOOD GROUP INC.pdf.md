PART I
Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Barfresh is a leader in the creation, manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products includes
smoothies, shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.
The Company’s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or “beverage packs”. The
beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, including the base (either sorbet, frozen yogurt or ice cream),
real fruit pieces, juices and ice – five ounces of water are added before blending.
The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, packaged in gallon containers in
a concentrated formula that is mixed “one to one” with water. The Company has a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format that is
specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and
Smart Snacks in Schools Program. The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In
addition, the Company received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to sell its smoothie products into all branches of
the U.S. Armed Forces, and is currently in contract with and selling its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases in the United
States and abroad.
Domestic and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh, as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve products.
Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition, the Company has purchased all of the trademarks
related to the patented products.
The Company conducts sales through several channels, including National Accounts, Regional Accounts, and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh’s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”), the U.S.’s largest
broadline distributor, which was entered into in July 2014.
Pursuant to that agreement, all Barfresh products are included in Sysco’s national core selection of beverage items, making Barfresh its exclusive
single-serve, pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive; however, Barfresh may also sell the products to other
foodservice distributors, but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to service multi-unit chain operators with at least 20 units
and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator’s nominated distributor for our products. On October 2, 2019, the exclusive distribution
agreement with Sysco expired, opening the possibility to expand distribution with other distributors outside of the Sysco system.
During 2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice operators.
On March 8, 2018, the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these foodservice operators, for
exclusive distribution of four of Barfresh’s single serve skus. On November 14, 2018, the Company announced that it had received approval for
multiple products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with over 2,500 locations.
On October 26, 2015, Barfresh signed a five year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages, a division of PepsiCo, to become its exclusive
sales representative within the food service channel to present Barfresh’s line of ready-to-blend smoothies and frozen beverages throughout the
United States and Canada. Through this agreement, Barfresh’ products are included as part of PepsiCo’s offerings to its significant customer base.
The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer accounts, through introductions provided by PepsiCo’s one-thousand plus person
foodservice sales team. Barfresh products have become part of PepsiCo’s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.
Barfresh utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of its products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational at two
locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City, which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products. Annual production
capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations, LLC., a subsidiary of Schulze
and Burch Biscuit Co., located in Arkansas. The Yarnell’s agreement, which was signed during February 2016, and secures the capacity to ramp up
to an incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell’s location enhances the company’s ability to efficiently move product throughout
the supply chain to destinations in the eastern United States, home to many of the country’s large foodservice outlets.
Our corporate office is located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720, Los Angeles, 90010. Our telephone number is (310) 598-7113 and our
website is www.barfresh.com.
Corporate History and Background
The Company, which was incorporated in Delaware on February 25, 2010, was originally formed to produce movies. As the result of the reverse
merger, more fully described below, the Company is now engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages,
including smoothies, shakes and frappes.

Reorganization and Recapitalization
During January 2012, the Company entered into a series of transactions pursuant to which Barfresh Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Barfresh NV”),
was acquired, spun-out prior operations to the former principal shareholder, completed a private offering of securities for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $1,000,000, conducted a four for one forward stock split and changed the name of the Company. The following describes the
steps of this reorganization:
● Acquisition of Barfresh NV. We acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Barfresh NV in exchange for the issuance of 37,333,328
shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between us, our former principal shareholder,
Barfresh NV and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV. As a result of this transaction, Barfresh NV became our wholly owned subsidiary
and the former shareholders of Barfresh NV became our controlling shareholders.
● Spinout of prior business. Immediately prior to the acquisition of Barfresh NV, we spun-out our previous business operations to a former
officer, director and principal shareholder, in exchange for all of the shares of our common stock held by that person. Such shares were
cancelled immediately following the acquisition.
● Financing transaction. Immediately following the acquisition of Barfresh, we sold an aggregate of 1,333,332 shares of our common stock
and five-year warrants to purchase 1,333,332 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.50 in a private offering for gross
proceeds of $999,998, less expenses of $26,895.
● Change of name. Subsequent to the merger, we changed the name of the Company from Moving Box Inc. to Barfresh Food Group Inc.
Barfresh Food Group Inc. has two direct subsidiaries; Barfresh Corporation, Inc, (formerly known as Smoothie, Inc.) and Barfresh, Inc.
● Forward stock split. Subsequent to the merger, we conducted a four for one forward stock split of the Company’s common stock.
Products
The Company’s products are made in two formats. The first is in portion controlled single serving beverage ingredient packs, suitable for
smoothies, shakes and frappes that can also be utilized for cocktails and mocktails. These packs contain all of the ingredients necessary to make a
smoothie, shake or frappe, including the ice. Simply add water, empty the packet into a blender, blend and serve. The second format is the bulk
“Easy Pour” format. The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, packaged in
gallon containers in a concentrated formula that is mixed “one to one” with water.

</Chart Analysis>
Competition
There is significant competition in the smoothie market at both the consumer purchasing level and also the product level.
The competition at the consumer level is primarily between specialized juice bars (e.g. Jamba Juice) and major fast casual and fast food restaurant
chains (such as McDonalds). Barfresh does not compete specifically at this level but intends to supply its product to customers that fall within these
segments to enable them to compete for consumer demand.
There may also be new entrants to the smoothie market that may alter the current competitor landscape.
The existing competition from a product perspective can be separated into three categories:
● Specialized juice bar products: The product is made in-store and each ingredient is added separately.
● Syrup based products: The fruit puree is supplied in bulk and not portion controlled for each smoothie. These types of products still
require the addition of juice, milk or water and/or yogurt and ice. While there are a number of competitors for this style of product, the two
dominant competitors are Island Oasis and Minute Maid.
● Portion pack products: These products contain only the fruit and yogurt and require the addition of juice or milk and ice. The dominant
competitor is General Mills’ Yoplait Smoothies.
The Company believes that its single serve products afford a very significant competitive advantage based on ease of use, portion control, premium
quality, and minimal capital investment required to enable a customer to begin to carry Barfresh beverage products. The Company also believes
that its bulk “Easy Pour” product represents an attractive alternative delivery method for customers that serve high volume locations, where speed
of service over extended periods is a critical requirement. The Company has recently launched a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour”
format that is specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch
Program, and Smart Snacks in Schools Program.
Intellectual Property
Barfresh owns the domestic and intellectual property rights to its products’ sealed pack of ingredients used in its single serve products.
In November 2011, the Company acquired patent applications filed in the United States (Patent Application number 11/660415) and Canada
(Patent Application number 2577163) from certain related parties. The United States patent was originally filed on December 4, 2007 and it was
granted during August of 2017. The Canadian patent was originally filed on August 16, 2005 and it was granted on May 27, 2014.
On October 15, 2013, the Company acquired all of the related international patent rights, which were filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation
Treaty, have been granted in 13 jurisdictions and are pending in the remainder of the jurisdictions that have signed the PCT. In addition, the
Company purchased all of the trademarks related to the patented products.
Governmental Approval and Regulation
The Company is not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of its products.
The Company utilizes contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contracts, the Company determines that the manufacturer
meets all government requirements.
Environmental Laws
The Company does not believe that it will be subject to any environmental laws, either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing will be
the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.

Employees
The Company currently has 17 employees and 2 consultants. There are currently 12 employees selling our products.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
An investment in the Company’s securities involves significant risks, including the risks described below. The risks included below are not the only
ones that the Company faces. Additional risks presently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial or unlikely to occur could also
impair our operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any such additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our
business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.
The impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to our operations
has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. Specifically, our business has been impacted by dining bans
targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains have closed operations and furloughed employees
which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments for a number of weeks. Furthermore, many school
districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk
Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, where the entire state has been issued a “shelter in place”
order from the Governor of California. Consequently, our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point, we
have not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid and
dynamic, and consequently, will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health officials, as well as, the
business community.
Risks Related to Our Business
We have a history of operating losses
We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability. These operating losses have been generated while we market to
potential customers. We cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving
nature of the industry in which we operate, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect the
Company’s business, including our ability to raise additional funds.
If we continue to suffer losses from operations, our working capital may be insufficient to support our ability to expand our business operations as
rapidly as we would deem necessary at any time, unless we are able to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be
able to pursue our business objectives and would be required to reduce our level of operations, including reducing infrastructure, promotions, sales
and marketing programs, personnel and other operating expenses. These events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition. If adequate funds are not available or if they are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund the growth of our
operations, take advantage of opportunities, develop products or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, could be significantly
limited.
We may need additional financing in the future, which may not be available when needed or may be costly and dilutive.
We may require additional financing to support our working capital needs in the future. The amount of additional capital we may require, the
timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic
initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Additionally, the amount of
capital required will depend on our ability to meet our case sales goals and otherwise successfully execute our operating plan. We believe it is
imperative to meet these sales objectives in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future. Although we believe various debt and
equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be
available to us when needed. Additionally, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly
dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital
requirements. If necessary, we may explore strategic transactions that we consider to be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders,
which may include, without limitation, public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, and other strategic alternatives; however, these
options may not ultimately be available or feasible.
A worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business
strategy.
Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the
availability of discretionary income. There is no certainty regarding economic conditions in the United States, and credit and financial markets and
confidence in economic conditions could deteriorate at any time. Accordingly, we may experience declines in revenue during economic turmoil or
during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending, leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective
in restaurants visited, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, business and financial condition.
The challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins.
We compete with many well-established companies, food service and otherwise, on the basis of taste, quality and price of product offered, customer
service, atmosphere, location and overall guest experience. Our success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our products and our ability to
develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts. Shifts in consumer preferences away from our products, our inability to
develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts, or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers
could harm our business. We compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers, specialty coffee retailers, yogurt and ice cream shops, bagel
shops, fast-food restaurants, delicatessens, cafés, take-out food service companies, supermarkets and convenience stores. Our competitors change
with each of the four day parts, ranging from coffee bars and bakery cafés to casual dining chains. Many of our competitors or potential
competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker
than we can. In addition, aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets, could reduce our revenue and
operating margins. We also compete with other employers in our markets for workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of
such competition.

The recent global coronavirus outbreak could harm our business and results of operations.
In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has
continued to spread, and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, and financial
markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. This
outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our product and harm our business and results of operations. It is not possible for
us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business or results of operations at this time.
Disruption within our supply chain, contract manufacturing or distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability, through our suppliers, business partners, contract manufacturers, independent distributors and retailers, to produce, transport,
distribute and sell products is critical to our success.
Damage or disruption to our suppliers or to manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism,
pandemics such as COVD-19 and influenza, labor strikes or other reasons, could impair the manufacture, distribution and sale of our products.
Many of these events are outside of our control. Failure to take adequate steps to protect against or mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of
such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers could further increase this risk. Most of our suppliers and
manufacturers produce similar products for other companies, and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. Further, it takes
a newly engaged manufacturer typically up to nine months of retrofitting/ preparation before it can begin producing our products. We have
contracts in place to produce sufficient units to meet projected demand; however, if one of our manufactures fails to perform, we would be faced
with a significant interruption in our supply chain. If one of our manufacturers or suppliers fails to perform or deliver products, for any reason, our
sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we are unable to meet our customers’ demands due to a disruption in
our supply chain, we may lose that customer which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our dependence on independent contract manufacturers could make management of our manufacturing and distribution efforts
inefficient or unprofitable.
We are expected to arrange for our contract manufacturing needs sufficiently in advance of anticipated requirements, which is customary in the
contract manufacturing industry for comparably sized companies. Based on the cost structure and forecasted demand for the particular geographic
area where our contract manufacturers are located, we continually evaluate which of our contract manufacturers to use. To the extent demand for
our products exceeds available inventory or the production capacity of our contract manufacturing arrangements, or orders are not submitted on a
timely basis, we will be unable to fulfill distributor orders on demand. Conversely, we may produce more product inventory than warranted by the
actual demand for it, resulting in higher storage costs and the potential risk of inventory spoilage. Our failure to accurately predict and manage our
contract manufacturing requirements and our inventory levels may impair relationships with our independent distributors and key accounts, which,
in turn, would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective relationships with those distributors and key accounts.
If we do not adequately manage our inventory levels, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products to distributors on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our
ability to correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly for new products,
seasonal promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of
raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate distributor or retailer demand for our products, we
may end up with too much inventory, resulting in higher storage costs, increased trade spending and the risk of inventory spoilage. If we fail to
manage our inventory to meet demand, we could damage our relationships with our distributors and retailers and could delay or lose sales
opportunities, which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the inventory of our
products held by our distributors and retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which would also unfavorably impact
our sales and adversely affect our operating results.
11

Increases in costs of packaging, ingredients and contract manufacturing tolling fees may have an adverse impact on our gross
margin.
Packaging costs such as paper and aluminum cans have experienced industry wide price increases in the past and there is always the risk that the
company’s co-packers increase their toll rates based on increases in their fixed and variable costs. If the Company is unable to pass on these costs,
the gross margin will be significantly impacted.
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
We may become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. Litigation involves significant risks, uncertainties and costs, including distraction
of management attention away from our business operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of
unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves
and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information
available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially
from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our employees and
agents with all U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to
government officials. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not ensure full compliance by our employees and agents with all applicable
legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could
result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits.
We have identified a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not
remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial
obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.
Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce
reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A – “Controls and Procedures” of this Form 10-K, we have re-evaluated our internal control over
financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2019, due to
inadequate segregation of duties.
A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. The material weakness we identified is inadequate segregation of duties.
The Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company’s remediation plans
has commenced and is being overseen by the audit committee. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be
remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses or the
development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial
statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock and we could
fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
12

Fluctuations in various food and supply costs, particularly fruit and dairy, could adversely affect our operating results.
Supplies and prices of the various ingredients that we are going to use to can be affected by a variety of factors, such as weather, seasonal
fluctuations, demand, politics and economics in the producing countries.
These factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies, which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In addition, the
prices of fruit and dairy, which are the main ingredients in our products, can be highly volatile. The fruit of the quality we seek tends to trade on a
negotiated basis, depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. An increase in pricing of any fruit that we are going to use in our
products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure our fruit supply.
Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel, and our business
may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.
Our future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. If one or more of our senior
executives is unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in his present position, we may have to spend a considerable amount of time and
resources searching, recruiting, and integrating a replacement into our operations, which would substantially divert management’s attention from
our business and severely disrupt our business. This may also adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy.
Our senior management’s limited experience managing a publicly traded company may divert management’s attention from
operations and harm our business.
Our senior management team has relatively limited experience managing a publicly traded company and complying with federal securities laws,
including compliance with recently adopted disclosure requirements on a timely basis. Our management will be required to design and implement
appropriate programs and policies in responding to increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, and any failure to do so
could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and harm our business.
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, experienced, highly skilled personnel, which could adversely affect the
implementation of our business plan.
Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled and qualified personnel. As we become a more
mature company in the future, we may find recruiting and retention efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring and
integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively. The loss of any key
employee, including members of our senior management team, and our inability to attract highly skilled personnel with sufficient experience in our
industries could harm our business.
Product liability exposure may expose us to significant liability.
We may face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims and lawsuits in the event that the development or use of our
technology or prospective products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. We may not be able to avoid significant liability exposure.
Although we believe our insurance coverage to be adequate, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain
sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. An inability to obtain product liability insurance at acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against
potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. A product liability claim could hurt our financial
performance. Even if we ultimately avoid financial liability for this type of exposure, we may incur significant costs in defending ourselves that
could hurt our financial performance and condition.
Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights may force us to incur unanticipated costs.
Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and internationally for certain intellectual
property incorporated into our products. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could
limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing similar solutions that limit the effectiveness of our patent protection and force us to incur
unanticipated costs. In addition, existing laws of some countries in which we may provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of
our intellectual property rights.
13

Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, and third parties may infringe our proprietary rights,
either of which may result in lawsuits, distraction of management and the impairment of our business.
As the number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases, products based on our technology
may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims. Third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future. Infringement
claims with or without merit could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty
or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, might not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We may initiate
claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation to
determine the validity of any claims, whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks. If there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation, we may be
required to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use and sale of infringing products and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing
technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology. Our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could prevent us from selling our
products.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our
share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock may be impacted, in part, by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
our business or us. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more
analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price may decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage
of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or
trading volume to decline.
We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to
devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.
As a public company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public
companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our
management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these
rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company, nor can we predict the
timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as
a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in
continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
Failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies
from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some foreign
companies, including some that may compete with our Company, may not be subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs,
theft and other fraudulent practices may occur from time-to-time in countries in which we conduct our business. However, our employees or other
agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such
practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
14

It is difficult to predict the timing and amount of our sales because our distributors and national accounts may not be required to
place minimum orders with us.
Our distributors are not required to place minimum monthly or annual orders for our products. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing or
quantity of purchases by any of our independent distributors or whether any of our distributors will continue to purchase products from us in the
same frequencies and volumes as they may have done in the past. Additionally, our larger distributors and partners may make orders that are
larger than we have historically been required to fill. Shortages in inventory levels, supply of raw materials or other key supplies could negatively
affect us.
If we do not adequately manage our inventory levels, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We need to maintain adequate inventory levels to be able to deliver products on a timely basis. Our inventory supply depends on our ability to
correctly estimate demand for our products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly for new products, seasonal
promotions and new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to maintain sufficient inventory of raw
materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. If we overestimate retailer demand for our products, we may end up with
too much inventory, resulting in higher storage costs, increased trade spend and the risk of obsolete inventory. If we fail to manage our inventory
to meet demand, we could damage our relationships with our retailers and could delay or lose sales opportunities, which would unfavorably impact
our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, which is a significantly more limited trading market than the New York Stock Exchange, or the
NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of the Company’s shares on the OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential
shareholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact
on our ability to raise capital in the future.
There is limited liquidity on the OTCQB, which may result in stock price volatility and inaccurate quote information.
When fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTCQB, price volatility may increase and price movement may outpace the ability to
deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of our common stock, there may be a lower likelihood of one’s orders
for shares of our common stock being executed, and current prices may differ significantly from the price one was quoted at the time of one’s order
entry.
If we are unable to adequately fund our operations, we may be forced to voluntarily file for deregistration of our common stock with
the SEC.
Compliance with the periodic reporting requirements required by the SEC consumes a considerable amount of both internal, as well external,
resources and represents a significant cost for us. If we are unable to continue to devote adequate funding and the resources needed to maintain
such compliance, while continuing our operations, we could be forced to deregister with the SEC. After the deregistration process, our common
stock would only be tradable on the “Pink Sheets” and could suffer a decrease in or absence of liquidity.
15

Because we became public by means of a “reverse merger”, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.
Additional risks may exist since we became public through a “reverse merger”. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide
coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We cannot assure you that
brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our Company in the future.
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise
funds in future securities offerings.
Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could
adversely affect the then prevailing market price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future through a
public offering of our securities.
Our common stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to
raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.
Currently, the Company’s common stock is quoted in the OTCQB and future trading volume may be limited by the fact that many major institutional
investment funds, including mutual funds, as well as individual investors follow a policy of not investing in OTCQB stocks and certain major
brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending OTCQB stocks because they are considered speculative, volatile and thinly traded. The
OTCQB market is an inter-dealer market much less regulated than the major exchanges and our common stock is subject to abuses, volatility and
shorting. Thus, there is currently no broadly followed and established trading market for the Company’s common stock. An established trading
market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy
and sell orders. Absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of the shares traded there.
The trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading activity, the quoted
price for the Company’s common stock on the OTCQB may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market value. Further, if we cease to be
quoted, holders would find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the
Company’s common stock and as a result, the market value of our common stock likely would decline.
Our common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.
The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve
our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general
conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the Company’s competitors or the Company itself. In addition,
the OTCQB is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in general. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of
securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.
We are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.
Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB. Our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15(g)-9, promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act as long as the price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share. Under such rule, broker-dealers who recommend low-
priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements, including a
requirement that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s consent prior to the
transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires additional disclosure in connection with any
trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock. Generally, the Commission defines a penny stock as any equity security not traded on a national
exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. The required penny stock disclosures include the delivery, prior to any transaction,
of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. Such requirements could severely limit the market
liquidity of the securities and the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in the secondary market.
16

Because we do not intend to pay dividends, shareholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in
value.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our preferred stock or common stock. For the foreseeable future, it is expected that
earnings, if any, generated from our operations will be used to finance the growth of our business, and that no dividends will be paid to holders of
the Company’s common stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value.
There can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.
The price of our common stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.
The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:
● actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;
● announcements of developments by us or our competitors;
● announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
● adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;
● additions or departures of key personnel;
● introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
● sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market; and
● other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.
The stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or
not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management’s attention and Company resources, which could harm our
business and financial condition.
Investors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common
stock.
We intend to continue to seek financing through the issuance of equity or convertible securities to fund our operations. In the future, we may also
issue additional equity securities resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We may also issue additional
shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining
employees, future acquisitions or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock will result in
dilution to our shareholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.
17

Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be
beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current
management.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of
our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares.
These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing
the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management
team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more
difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by
the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess
of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
Item 2. Properties.
Our principal executive offices are located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720, Los Angeles, 90010. Beginning in April 2019, we leased this
office space pursuant to a direct lease for $6,457 per month through March 31, 2023.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are party to or have property that is the subject of any material pending legal proceedings. We may be
subject to ordinary legal proceedings incidental to our business from time to time that are not required to be disclosed under this Item 1.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The information and financial data discussed below is derived from the audited financial statements of Barfresh for its fiscal year ended December
31, 2019 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The financial statements of Barfresh were prepared and presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The information and financial data discussed below is only a summary and should be
read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes of Barfresh contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. This
discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future business. Our actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward
Looking Statements” above for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual
Report.
Barfresh is a leader in the creation, manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend frozen beverages. The current portfolio of products includes
smoothies, shakes and frappes. Products are packaged in two distinct formats.
The Company’s original single serve format features portion controlled and ready to blend beverage ingredient packs or “beverage packs”. The
beverage packs contain all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, including the base (either sorbet, frozen yogurt or ice cream),
real fruit pieces, juices and ice – five ounces of water are added before blending.
The Company’s bulk “Easy Pour” format also contains all of the solid ingredients necessary to make the beverage, packaged in gallon containers in
a concentrated formula that is mixed “one to one” with water. The Company has a “no sugar added” version of the bulk “Easy Pour” format that is
specifically targeted for the USDA national school meal program, including the School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and
Smart Snacks in Schools Program. The Company is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over three hundred schools. In
addition, the Company received approval from the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) to sell its smoothie products into all branches of
the U.S. Armed Forces, and is currently in contract to sell its bulk Easy Pour products into over one hundred military bases in the United States and
abroad.
Domestic and international patents and patents pending are owned by Barfresh, as well as related trademarks for all of the single serve products.
Patent rights have been granted in 13 jurisdictions including the United States. In addition, the Company has purchased all of the trademarks
related to the patented products.
The Company conducts sales through several channels, including National Accounts, Regional Accounts, and Broadline Distributors. Barfresh’s
primary broadline distribution arrangement is through an exclusive nationwide agreement with Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”), the U.S.’s largest
broadline distributor, which was entered into during July 2014. Pursuant to that agreement, all Barfresh products are included in Sysco’s national
core selection of beverage items, making Barfresh its exclusive single-serve, pre-portioned beverage provider. The agreement is mutually exclusive;
however, Barfresh may also sell the products to other foodservice distributors, but only to the extent required for such foodservice distributors to
service multi-unit chain operators with at least 20 units and where Sysco is not such multi- unit chain operator’s nominated distributor for our
products. On October 2, 2019, the exclusive distribution agreement with Sysco expired, opening the possibility to expand distribution with other
distributors outside of the Sysco system.
During 2016 and 2017 the Company announced that it had signed supply agreements with several of the major global on-site foodservice operators.
On March 8, 2018, the Company announced that it had signed a new supply agreement with one of the largest of these foodservice operators, for
exclusive distribution of four Barfresh single serve skus. On November 14, 2018, the Company announced that it had received approval for multiple
products to be rolled out to a national restaurant chain with over 2,500 locations.
On October 26, 2015, Barfresh signed a five-year agreement with PepsiCo North America Beverages, a division of PepsiCo, to become its exclusive
sales representative within the food service channel to present the Barfresh line of ready-to-blend smoothies and frozen beverages throughout the
United States and Canada. Through this agreement, Barfresh’ products are included as part of PepsiCo’s offerings to its significant customer base.
The agreement facilitates access to potential National customer accounts, through introductions provided by PepsiCo’s one thousand plus person
foodservice sales team. Barfresh products have become part of PepsiCo’s customer presentations at national trade shows and similar venues.
Barfresh utilizes contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products in the United States. Production lines are currently operational at two
locations. The first location is in Salt Lake City, which currently produces both bulk easy pour and single serve products. Annual production
capacity with this contract manufacturer is 14 million units per year. The second location is with Yarnell Operations, LLC., a subsidiary of Schulze
& Burch, located in Arkansas. The Yarnell’s agreement, which was signed during February 2016, and secures the capacity to ramp up to an
incremental production capacity of 100 million units. Yarnell’s location enhances the company’s ability to efficiently move product throughout the

During November 2016, the Company received an equity investment from Unibel, the majority shareholder of the Bel Group (“Unibel”). The Bel
Group is headquartered in Paris, France, with global operations in 33 countries, 30 production sites on 4 continents and nearly 12,000 employees.
Its many branded products, including The Laughing Cow®, Mini Babybel® and Boursin®, are sold in over 130 countries around the world.
Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, Unibel purchased 15,625,000 shares of common stock at $0.64 per share (“Shares”) and warrants
to purchase 7,812,500 shares of common stock (“Warrants”) for aggregate gross proceeds to Barfresh of $10 million. The Warrants are exercisable
for a term of five years at a per share price of $.88 for cash. Pursuant to the Investor Rights agreement, Barfresh has registered the Shares and the
Warrants, and Unibel was granted a seat on the Barfresh Board. This strategic investment provided Barfresh with necessary capital while
leveraging Unibel’s more than 150 years of industrial expertise, innovative capabilities, world-class marketing and branding expertise to accelerate
our growth in new and existing markets and product channels.
On February 14, 2018, the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing of the
first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22, 2018, after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered into a material
agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1,000 new locations. The
remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone, which is entering into a material agreement or
series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 2,500 new locations. During November of 2018
the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining
40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National Restaurant Chain with over 2,500 for the rollout of its products.
Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.
The convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term, (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company’s discretion
at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period
immediately preceding the payment date, but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common Stock. The investor’s may elect to
convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of: (i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock, or (ii) 85% of the
average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor’s
election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of
shares that would be issuable upon a full conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period
immediately preceding the applicable closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing,
investors will be granted an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater
of 120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement, investors were offered the opportunity to
accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%. After the close of the first quarter
2018, a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity, resulting in an increase in the amount of the total convertible note by
$177,300 and the issuance of 930,332 additional warrants. During the fourth quarter 2018, four of the convertible note investors elected to convert
their notes into stock, with a total of $453,000 of convertible debt, plus accrued interest being converted into stock.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, one investor exercised 833,333 N warrants for cash, at $0.45 per share. $221,918 of the proceeds of that
transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable, held by the same investor, in the amount of $200,000, plus accrued interest. The
balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise, in the amount of $153,082 were received by the Company.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company completed additional funding, including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at
$0.60 per share, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance of 4,000,000 shares. In addition,
during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants from $1 to $0.60, for a limited time. During the
time this offer was open, I Warrant holders converted 2,841,454 warrants at $0.60, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of
$1.7 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2019, one investor exercised G series warrants, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in
the amount of $180,000, and the issuance of 300,000 shares. In total, during the first quarter of 2019 the Company raised $4.3 million and issued
7,141,454 shares, and no additional warrants were issued.
On March 23, 2020, the Company completed additional funding, including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 per
share (subject to adjustment) resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance of 7,650,000 shares. The
investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to
each purchaser, exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60 per share (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average
trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the “Six Month Price”) exceeds or equals
$0.50 per share (the “Target Price”), the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month Price is less than the Target Price, the per
share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price, but in no event less than $0.35 per share, in which case the Company
shall issue to each investor, pro-rata based on such investor’s investment: (a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of
shares issued to such purchaser at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month
Price; and (b) a warrant for a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such
investor at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price, with an exercise price
equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price, but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share for each
warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price, but in no event less than $0.45 per share.
In addition, the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1,071,000 in principal, and conversion of $720,000 of principal of the Milestone I
Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110,166 was extended for thirty days. The interest rate on the principal
balance of the extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore, the Company obtained a 12 month extension on
$168,000 in principal, and conversion of $1,128,000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible Notes. The remaining $67,200 was extended for
thirty days. The Convertible Noteholders of the Milestone I and II Convertible Notes were granted additional interest depending upon their election
to convert or extend their Convertible Notes.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”).
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised
goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these
goods. The Company applies the following five steps:
1) Identify the contract with a customer
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights,
(ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or
services that are transferred is probable. For the Company, the contract is the approved sales order, which may also be supplemented by
other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.
2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or that will be transferred to the customer. For the
Company, this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages, which provide immediate benefit to the customer.
3) Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods
and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration, which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts, are
estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.
4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
Since our contracts contain a single performance obligation, delivery of frozen beverages, the transaction price is allocated to that single
performance obligation.
5) Recognize Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods,
which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or
discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs
and presented in distribution, selling and administrative costs.
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single
product, frozen beverages.
Share-based Compensation
We account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with
applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units
(RSUs), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis
over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.
22

Convertible Notes
We issue debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes. When we issue debt with warrants, we
determine the value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (“Black-Scholes”) using the stock price on the date of issuance,
the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and the estimated volatility of our stock. When we issue debt with a conversion
feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative. If the conversion feature within
convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Black-
Scholes upon the date of issuance, using the stock price on the date of issuance, the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and
the estimated volatility of our stock. If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature
(“BCF’). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically
occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the
intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible.
Derivative Liability
The Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” The result of this
accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event
that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability.
Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is
reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for
determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception
which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that
falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock” also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity’s own
stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or
embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock. First, the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by
an evaluation of the instrument’s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction
between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Results of Operations
Revenue and cost of revenue
Revenue increased $71,626, or 2%, from $4,235,159 in 2018 to $4,306,785 in 2019. Our products continue to be distributed through all 72 of
Sysco’s U.S. mainland distribution centers, as well as through new customers beyond the Sysco distribution network.
Cost of revenue for 2019 was $1,928,210 as compared to $2,033,396 in 2018. Our gross profit was $2,313,209 (54%) and $2,144,664 (51%) for
2019 and 2018, respectively. This improvement was driven by a number of factors, including leverage due to larger scale of production and product
mix. We anticipate that our gross profit percentage for 2020 will be comparable to that of 2019. Depreciation from manufacturing equipment was
$65,366 and $57,099 for December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Operating expenses
Our operations were primarily directed towards increasing sales and expanding our distribution network.
Our general and administrative expenses decreased $962,859 (12%) from $7,813,425 in 2018 to $6,850,566 in 2019, with the improvement driven
by lower personnel expenses resulting from reduced headcount, reduced stock-based compensation expense from terminated employees, and
reduced marketing and selling expense from a renegotiated distribution agreement. The following is a breakdown of our general and administrative
expenses for the years 2019 and 2018.

Personnel cost represents the cost of employees including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and employment taxes for the years 2019 and 2018
and continues to be our largest cost. Personnel cost decreased $189,863 (6%) from $3,027,548 to $2,837,685. At year end 2018 we had 26 full time
employees, and we currently have 17 full time employees.
Stock based compensation is used as an incentive to attract new employees and to compensate existing employees. Stock based compensation
includes stock issued and options granted to employees. Stock compensation for the current year was $225,026, a decrease of $273,742, or 55%,
from the year ago expense of $498,768. The decrease is primarily due to reductions in our workforce and the timing of equity grants. The Company
issues additional stock options to its employees from time to time under its Equity Compensation Plan.
Legal and professional fees decreased 34%, or $158,836, from $463,991 in 2018 to $305,155 in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced
legal services required. We anticipate legal fees related to our business and financing activities to decrease as we have renegotiated arrangements
with existing service providers.
Travel expenses decreased $73,685 (17%) from $432,140 in 2018 to $358,455 in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to reduced travel associated
with terminated employees. We anticipate that travel expenses for 2020 will be comparable to the current year.
Rent expense is primarily for our location in Los Angeles, California. Rent expense for the Los Angeles office is approximately $6,500 per month.
During 2018 we leased office space at 8383 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, California pursuant to a lease that commenced on November 1, 2016
and expired March 31, 2019, with monthly rent expense of $14,488. Effective April 1, 2019, we have entered into a new lease for office space
located at 3600 Wilshire Boulevard Suite 1720, Los Angeles, 90010.
24

Marketing and selling expenses decreased $181,952 (24%) from $750,059 in 2018 to $568,107 in 2019. Lower marketing and selling expenses
were primarily due to lower percentage commission associated with a renegotiated distribution agreement.
Consulting fees increased $58,612 (97%), from $60,359 in 2018, to $118,971 in 2019. The increase was due primarily to services related to
consulting to improve sales operations. Our consulting fees vary based on needs. We engaged consultants in the areas of sales operations during
the both 2019 and 2018. The need for future consulting services will be variable.
Director fees increased $4,386, or 2%, from $241,000 in 2018 to $245,386 in 2019 due to director and officer insurance premiums. Annual director
fees are anticipated at $50,000 per non-employee director.
Research and development expenses decreased $135,833, (20%) from $674,224 in 2018 to $538,391 in 2019 due to reduced product development
activity with national accounts and fewer market tests. These expenses relate to the services performed by our Director of Manufacturing and
Product Development, and consultants supporting that employee. These activities are primarily directed towards to development of new products.
Shipping and storage expense decreased $113,634 (13%) from $864,871 in 2018 to $751,237 in 2019. Shipping and storage expense as a
percentage of revenue decreased from 20% in 2018 to 17% in 2019. This improvement is primarily due to the growth of the scale of our business,
and the corresponding cost savings associated with freight movement. We anticipate that shipping and storage expense as a percentage of sales
will continue to reduce in the future, as the Company continues to take advantage of more efficient distribution arrangements.
Other expenses consist of ordinary operating expenses such as investor relations, office, telephone, insurance, and stock related costs. Other
expense increased $210,180, from $599,364 in 2018 to $809,544 in 2019, driven mainly by equipment repair, recruiting, and insurance expense.
We had operating losses of $5,187,204 in 2019 and $6,180,080 in 2018. The improvement of $992,876 or 16%, was primarily due to higher gross
profit margin, and lower G&A expenses.
Interest expense for 2019 is $1,213,263 relates to “Milestone 1” convertible debt in the amount of $2,704,800 that was issued on March 14, 2018,
which bears interest at 10%, “Milestone 2” convertible debt in the amount of $1,363,200 that was issued on November 30, 2018, which bears
interest at 10%. Of the Milestone 1 convertible debt, $453,000 of principal, and the accrued interest thereon, was converted into stock during the
fourth quarter of 2018. The principal and accrued interest on the Note Payable in the amount of $250,000 was repaid during the fourth quarter of
2018. Interest expense for 2019 includes amortization of $881,871 of the value of warrants issued with the Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 convertible
debt.
The change in fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a gain of $1,114,625 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain was driven by
the decrease in the stock price of the Company.
The warrant modification was revalued at February 22, 2019 with a value of $849,505. The difference in fair value immediately before and after the
modification of the warrant resulted in a loss of $307,460.
We had net losses of $5,593,302 and $7,322,823 for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. This reduction in net loss, in the amount of $1,729,521,
or 24%, is primarily attributable to the same factors that drove the improvement in operating losses, partially offset by certain non-cash charges,
including higher interest, warrant modification, and gain from derivative liability, in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital surplus of $146,337 as compared with a working capital surplus of $652,360 at December 31,
2018. The reduction in working capital surplus is primarily due to the reduction in inventory and an increase in accrued interest, partially offset by
a reduction in accrued liabilities.
25

During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $3,353,326 in operations, $466,216 for the purchase of equipment, and
$5,324 for patents and trademarks. The Company received $1,500,357 in cash for warrant exercises, $2,400,000 in cash for issuance of stock and
paid $25,686 in operating leases.
Our liquidity needs will depend on how quickly we are able to profitably ramp up sales, as well as our ability to control and reduce variable
operating expenses, and to continue to control and reduce fixed overhead expense.
On February 14, 2018, the Company announced the private placement of convertible notes with gross proceeds of $4.1 million The closing of the
first 60% of this amount occurred between March 12 and 22, 2018, after notice was issued by the Company that it had entered into a material
agreement or series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 1,000 new locations. The
remaining 40% of the principal amount was to be received upon achieving a second milestone, which is entering into a material agreement or
series of related agreements with a national account for the sale of its products into approximately 2,500 new locations. During November of 2018
the Company and several of the Convertible Note investors agreed to amend the definition of Milestone 2 to allow for the funding the remaining
40% of the principal amount upon the Company receiving approval from a National Restaurant Chain with over 2,500 for the rollout of its products.
Such approval was received during the fourth quarter of 2018, and the Company received an additional $1.4 million of convertible note proceeds.
The convertible notes are unsecured and have (i) a two-year term, (ii) a 10% annual coupon to be paid in cash or stock at the Company’s discretion
at a conversion price equal to 85% of the average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period
immediately preceding the payment date, but in no event lower than sixty cents ($0.60) per share of Common Stock. The investor’s may elect to
convert their principal into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of: (i) $0.88 per share of Common Stock, or (ii) 85% of the
average closing bid prices of the Common Stock over the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date of investor’s
election to convert; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share of Common Stock. Investors also received warrant coverage of 25% of the number of
shares that would be issuable upon a full conversion of the principal amount at an average of the twenty consecutive trading day period
immediately preceding the applicable closing date. If any principal amount remains outstanding after the one-year anniversary of the closing,
investors will be granted an additional warrant with identical terms. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years for cash at the greater
of 120% of the closing price or $0.70 per share of common stock. After the initial private placement, investors were offered the opportunity to
accelerate the issuance of the additional warrant by increasing their convertible note investment by 10% to 20%. After the close of the first quarter
of 2018, a number of investors took advantage of this acceleration opportunity, resulting in an increase in the amount of the total convertible note
by $177,300 and the issuance of 930,332 additional warrants. During the fourth quarter of 2018, four of the convertible note investors elected to
convert their notes into stock, with a total of $453,000 of convertible debt, plus accrued interest being converted into stock.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, one investor exercised 833,333 N warrants for cash, at $0.45 per share. $221,918 of the proceeds of that
transaction were used to pay down a short term note payable, held by the same investor, in the amount of $200,000, plus accrued interest. The
balance of the proceeds of the N warrant exercise, in the amount of $153,082 were received by the Company.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company completed additional funding including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at
$0.60 per share, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of $2.4 million and the issuance of 4,000,000 shares. In addition,
during the first quarter of 2019 the Company offered to reduce the exercise price on its I Warrants from $1 to $0.60, for a limited time. During the
time this offer was open, I Warrant holders converted 2,841,454 warrants at $0.60, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in the amount of
$1.7 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2019, one investor exercised G series warrants, resulting in the receipt of capital investment in
the amount of $180,000, and the issuance of 300,000 shares. In total, during the first quarter of 2019 the Company has raised $4.3 million and
issued 7,141,454 shares, and no additional warrants.
On March 23, 2020, the Company completed additional funding, including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 per
share (subject to adjustment), resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance of 7,650,000 shares. The
investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to
each purchaser, exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60 per share (subject to adjustment) but in no event less than $0.45
per share. If the volume-weighted average trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing
(the “Six Month Price”) exceeds or equals $0.50 per share (the “Target Price”), the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month
Price is less than the Target Price, the per share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price, but in no event less than
$0.35 per share, in which case the Company shall issue to each investor, pro-rata based on such investor’s investment: (a) shares in a quantity that
equals the difference between the number of shares issued to such purchaser at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to
such purchaser at closing at the Six Month Price; and (b) a warrant for a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between
the number of shares issued to such investor at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six
Month Price, with an exercise price equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price, but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The
exercise price per share for each warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price, but in no event less than
$0.45 per share. In addition, the Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1,071,000 in principal, and conversion of $720,000 of principal of the
Milestone I Convertible Notes at a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110,166 was extended for thirty days. The interest rate on
the principal balance of the extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore, the Company obtained a 12 month
extension on $168,000 in principal, and conversion of $1,128,000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible Notes. The remaining $67,200 was

their election to convert or extend their Convertible Notes.
The impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to our operations
has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. Specifically, our business has been impacted by dining bans
targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains have closed operations and furloughed employees
which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments for a number of weeks. Furthermore, many school
districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk
Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, where the entire state has been issued a “shelter in place”
order from the Governor of California. Consequently, our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point, we
have not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid and
dynamic, and consequently, will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health officials, as well as, the
business community.
Our operations to date have been financed by the sale of securities, the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of short-term debt, including
related party advances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations with the capital raised we will be required to raise
additional funds either in the form of equity or in the form of debt. There are no assurances that we will be able to generate the necessary capital to
carry out our current plan of operations.

We have entered into a direct lease for new premises covering the period April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2023. The aggregate minimum requirements
under the non-cancellable direct lease as of December 31, 2019 is $254,368.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to
stockholders.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-
15(f). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019, due to inadequate segregation of duties.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. The framework
used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “Internal Control – Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-
15(f). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President Finance concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019.
27

Management has identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting:
Inadequate Segregation of Duties: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement internal controls over financial reporting.
Since the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did identify material weaknesses, management considers
its internal control over financial reporting to be ineffective.
Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective
internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material
misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or
due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.
In an effort to remediate the identified material weakness and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we plan to engage additional
financial personnel to help ensure that we are able to properly implement internal control procedures.
This report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and
is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general
incorporation language in such filing.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, there was a significant reduction in headcount, specifically in the areas of finance,
operations and administration. The decrease in staffing gave rise to a material weakness over our internal control over financial reporting. The
Company will evaluate the staffing necessary to reinstate the documentation standards sufficient to ensure proper implementation of internal
control procedures over the coming quarters.

director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the
Company’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We
determined, as of December 31, 2018, that five of our seven directors are independent, which constitutes a majority. One of our directors, Alice
Elliot, resigned effective April 1, 2019, reducing the current number of directors to six, four of which are independent.

shareholder known to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) each named executive officer and
director, and (iii) all executive officers and directors as a group. A person is considered to beneficially own any shares: (i) over which such person,
directly or indirectly, exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or (ii) of which such person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership
at any time within 60 days through an exercise of stock options or warrants or otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, voting and investment power
relating to the shares shown in the table for our directors and executive officers is exercised solely by the beneficial owner or shared by the owner

For purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of any shares of common stock that such person

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The following includes a summary of transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2019 or any currently proposed transaction, in which we were or are
to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-
end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than
compensation described under “Executive Compensation”). We believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received, as applicable,
in connection with the transactions described below were comparable to or better than terms available or the amounts that would be paid or
received, as applicable, in arm’s-length transactions.
The Company’s policy with regard to related party transactions requires any related party loans that are (i) non-interest bearing and in excess of
$100,000 or (ii) interest bearing, irrespective of amount, must be approved by the Company’s board of directors. All issuances of securities by the
Company must be approved by the board of directors, irrespective of whether the recipient is a related party. Each of the foregoing transactions, if
required by its terms, was approved in this manner.
Director Independence
We use the definition of “independence” standards as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an “independent
director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the
Company’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We have
determined as of December 31, 2019 that four of our six directors are independent, which constitutes a majority.
Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services.
Aggregate fees for professional services rendered to the Company by Eide Bailly LLP for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2018 were as follows.
2019 2018
Audit fees $ 85,195 $ 71,982
Audit related fees - -
Tax fees 8,375 15,181
All other fees - -
Total $ 93,570 $ 87,166
As defined by the SEC, (i) “audit fees” are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial
statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-K, or for services that are normally provided by the accountant in
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) “audit-related fees” are fees for assurance and related
services by our principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not
reported under “audit fees;” (iii) “tax fees” are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice,
and tax planning; and (iv) “all other fees” are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant, other than the services reported
under “audit fees,” “audit-related fees,” and “tax fees.”
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed for the years end December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were for the audits of our financial statements
and reviews of our interim financial statements included in our annual and quarterly reports.
Audit Related Fees. Eide Bailly LLP did not provide us with audit related services for the years ended December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018,
that are not reported under Audit Fees.

39

All Other Fees. Eide Bailly LLP did not provide us with professional services related to “Other Fees” for the years ended December 31, 2019 or
December 31, 2018.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Under the SEC’s rules, an audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered
public accounting firm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors’ independence. The SEC’s rules specify the types of non-audit
services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the audit committee’s responsibility for administration of the
engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Company has established an Audit Committee. Accordingly, audit services
and non-audit services described in this Item 14 were pre-approved by an Audit Committee.
There were no hours expended on the principal accountant’s engagement to audit the registrant’s financial statements for the most recent fiscal
year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the principal accountant’s full-time, permanent employees.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Barfresh Food Group, Inc.
Los Angeles, California
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barfresh Food Group, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Barfresh Food Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to Barfresh Food Group, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Barfresh Food Group Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Barfresh Food Group Inc., (“we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company”) was incorporated on February 25, 2010 in the State of Delaware. We are
engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of ready to blend beverages, particularly, smoothies, shakes and frappes.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“GAAP”).
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries, Barfresh Inc. and
Barfresh Corporation Inc. (formerly known as Smoothie, Inc.). All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been
eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The amount of cash on deposit with financial institutions exceeds the $250,000 federally insured limit at December 31, 2019 and 2018. However,
we believe that cash on deposit that exceeds $250,000 in the financial institutions is financially sound and the risk of loss is minimal.
Restricted Cash
In the third quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”),
which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires
additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $91,385 in restricted cash related to our co-packing
agreement with Yarnell Operations, LLC.
Fair Value Measurement
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(“ASC 820”), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value
measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques,
giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs.
ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and
liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported
date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with
models using highly observable inputs.
Level 3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3
are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used
to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.
Our financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative liabilities, and convertible notes. The
carrying value of our financial instruments approximates their fair value, except for the derivative liability in which carrying value is fair value.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured. Our credit policy calls for payment generally within 30 days. The credit worthiness of a customer is
evaluated prior to a sale. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was $141,788 and $61,788
respectively. There was $89,397 of bad debt expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $61,788 of bad debt expense for the year
ended December 31, 2018. The allowance was applied to certain receivable accounts which are over 95 days.
F-7

Inventory
Inventory consists of finished goods and is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in first out basis. The company monitors the
remaining useful life of its inventory and establishes a reserve of obsolescence where appropriate. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the
Company’s inventory reserve was $100,651 and $31,237 respectively.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are comprised of patents, net of amortization and trademarks. The patent costs are being amortized over the life of the patent,
which is twenty years from the date of filing the patent application. In accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC
350”), the costs of internally developing other intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred. However, as allowed by ASC 350, costs
associated with the acquisition of patents from third parties, legal fees and similar costs relating to patents have been capitalized.
In accordance with ASC 350 legal costs related to trademarks have been capitalized. We have determined that trademarks have an indeterminable
life and therefore are not being amortized.
Long-Lived Assets and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the
carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
We have not recorded any impairment charges during the years presented.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the lease term that includes any expected renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured. The estimated useful lives
used for financial statement purposes are:
Furniture and fixtures: 5 years
Manufacturing equipment and customer equipment: 3 years to 7 years
Leasehold improvements: 2 years
Vehicles: 5 years
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains ownership of promised
goods. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these
goods. The Company applies the following five steps:
1) Identify the contract with a customer
A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights,
(ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or
services that are transferred is probable. For the Company, the contract is the approved sales order, which may also be supplemented by
other agreements that formalize various terms and conditions with customers.
2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. For
the Company, this consists of the delivery of frozen beverages, which provide immediate benefit to the customer.
F-8

3) Determine the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods
and is generally stated on the approved sales order. Variable consideration, which typically includes volume-based rebates or discounts, are
estimated utilizing the most likely amount method.
4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
Since our contracts contain a single performance obligation, delivery of frozen beverages, the transaction price is allocated to that single
performance obligation.
5) Recognize Revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of frozen beverages when title and risk of loss passes and the customer accepts the goods,
which generally occurs at the time of delivery to a customer warehouse. Customer sales incentives such as volume-based rebates or
discounts are treated as a reduction of sales at the time the sale is recognized. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs
and presented in distribution, selling and administrative costs.
The company evaluated the requirement to disaggregate revenue and concluded that substantially all of its revenue comes from a single
product, frozen beverages.
Research and Development
Expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. We incurred $538,391
and $674,224, in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Shipping and Storage Costs
Shipping and handling costs are included in general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, shipping and
handling costs totaled $751,237 and $864,871, respectively.
Rent Expense
As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842. ASC 842 replaced the prior lease accounting guidance in its entirety. As disclosed in Note 7,
we entered into a new office space lease that took effect on April 1, 2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts
that approximate our future commitments of $241,555. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-
line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements,
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially
and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of evidence, it is more than likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax
positions.
F-9

Derivative Liability
The Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components
of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” The result of this
accounting treatment is that the fair value of any derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event
that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as gain/loss from derivative liability.
Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is
reclassified to equity. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for
determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception
which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that
falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock” also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity’s own
stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or
embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock. First, the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by
an evaluation of the instrument’s settlement provisions. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction
between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Earnings per Share
We calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed by including
common stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 any equivalents would have been anti-
dilutive as we had losses for the periods then ended.
Stock Based Compensation
We calculate stock compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Based Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires that
the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the
measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee stock ownership plans
Recent pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of
recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases”, to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require
organizations that lease assets (“lessees”) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more
than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a
right-of-use asset represents the lessee’s right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU leaves the
accounting for the organization that own the assets leased to the lessee (“lessor”) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it
with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
The Company has evaluated the effect of the standard on our financial statements. Based on our evaluation, we have one material lease subject to
adoption of this standard, effective January 1, 2019. As disclosed in Note 8, we entered into a new office space lease that took effect on April 1,
2019 and recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for amounts that approximate our future commitments of $241,555.

respectively. Depreciation expense in Cost of Goods Sold was $65,366 and $57,099 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
Note 4. Intangible Assets
As of December 31, 2019, intangible assets consist of patent costs of $764,891, trademarks of $108,632 and accumulated amortization of $394,020.
As of December 31, 2018, intangible assets consist of patent costs of $764,891, trademarks of $103,309 and accumulated amortization of $330,411.
The amounts carried on the balance sheet represent cost to acquire, legal fees and similar costs relating to the patents incurred by the Company.
Amortization is calculated through the expiration date of the patent, which is December 2025. The amount charged to expenses for amortization of

Note 6. Convertible Notes (Related and Unrelated Party)
In March 2018, we closed an offering of $2,527,500 in convertible notes, Series CN Note 1 of 2, of which, management, directors and significant
shareholders have invested $840,000. The convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on March 14, 2020. The notes
are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88 per share or 85% of the average closing price
of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election; but in no event lower than
$0.60 per share. In addition, the interest is convertible at any time prior to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the
average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election; but
in no event lower than $0.60 per share. There were 1,331,583 warrants issued, in conjunction with the convertible note offering.
The fair value of the warrants, $0.17 per share ($220,548 in the aggregate), was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions:
Expected life (in years) 3
Volatility (based on a comparable company) 54.82%
Risk Free interest rate 2.41%
Dividend yield (on common stock) -
The value of $220,548 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants.
In April 2018, we offered investors in our March 2018 Convertible Note (“Series CN Notes”) the opportunity to accelerate the issuance of certain
warrants associated with the CN Notes. Pursuant to the acceleration offer, Series CN Notes investors who invested an additional 10% to 20% of the
Series CN Note amount, immediately received an additional 25% warrant coverage on their initial CN Note investment, which would otherwise
have been issued after one year. During April 2018, we closed the CN Note acceleration offer in the amount of $177,300 in convertible notes, of
which, management, directors and significant shareholders have invested $30,000. The CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes bear 10%
interest per annum and are due and payable on March 14, 2020. The notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock
at conversion price of $0.88 per share or 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share. In addition, the interest is convertible at any
time prior to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election; but in no event lower than $0.60 per share. There were 937,373
warrants issued in conjunction with the Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible note offering.
The fair value of the warrants, $0.25 per share ($235,519 in the aggregate), was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following assumptions:
Expected life (in years) 3
Volatility (based on a comparable company) 55.49%
Risk Free interest rate 2.45%
Dividend yield (on common stock) -
The value of $105,199 was recorded as a debt discount related to the issuance of the warrants as using the fair value would cause the debt discount
to exceed the gross proceeds received.
In November and December 2018, three investors elected to convert their convertible note issued on March 14, 2018 into stock. The total debt
converted was $453,000 and $30,459 accrued interest into 804,396 shares of stock.
In March 2019, an investor elected to exercise I-Warrants by using part of the investor’s convertible note. The total debt settled was $350,634 of
principal and $33,929 of accrued interest.
The convertible notes consist of the following components as of the year-end:
31-Dec-19 31-Dec-18
Convertible notes $ 2,704,800 $ 2,704,800
Less: Debt discount (warrant value) (325,747) (325,747)

In December 2018, we closed an offering of $1,363,200 in convertible notes, Series CN 2 of 2, of which, management, directors and significant
shareholders have invested $560,000. The convertible notes bear 10% interest per annum and are due and payable on November 30, 2020. The
notes are convertible at any time prior to the due date into our common stock at conversion price of $0.88 per share or 85% of the average closing
price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election; but in no event lower
than $0.60 per share. In addition, the interest is convertible at any time prior to the due dates into our common stock at conversion price of 85% of
the average closing price of the common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of note holders’ election;
but in no event lower than $0.60 per share. There were 678,864 warrants issued, in conjunction with the convertible note offering.

Note 7. Derivative Liabilities
As discussed in Note 6, Convertible Notes, the Company issued Series CN Note acceleration offer convertible notes payable that provide variable
conversion provisions. The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors, such as the future price of the
Company’s common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company’s common stock,
therefore the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate.
The fair values of the Company’s derivative liabilities are estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date. The
Company recognized a derivative liability and debt discount of $569,588 at March 14, 2018 related to the Series CN Convertible notes 1 of 2;
$69,400 at April 11, 2018 related to the Series CN Notes Warrant Acceleration; and $697,186 at November 30, 2018 related to the Series CN
Convertible note 2 of 2. The derivative liability was revalued at December 31, 2019 and 2018 with a value of $211,028 and $1,325,653. The
Company recorded a net gain of $1,114,625 and a net loss of $87,630 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the
derivative liability. The 2018 net loss consists of a $110,829 gain for a portion of the derivative liability being settled upon a noteholders decision to
convert their outstanding principal to equity under the terms of the convertible note agreement, and a loss of $198,459 from the change in fair
value.
The fair value of the derivative liability for CN Convertible Note 1 of 2 and CN Note Warrant Acceleration was calculated using the Black-Scholes
model using the following assumptions.
31-Dec-19 31-Dec-18

Change in valuation allowance $ 2,426,000 $ 1,066,800
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate before provision for income
taxes. The sources and tax effect of the differences are as follows:
2019 2018
Income tax provision at the federal statutory rate 21.0% 21.0%

Net operating loss carryover $ 10,395,000 $ 7,969,000
Valuation allowance (10,395,000) (7,969,000)
$ - $ -
ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of evidence, it is more than likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative,
management has determined that a $10,395,000 and $7,969,000 allowance at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, is necessary to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The increase in the valuation allowance for the current period is
$2,426,000.
As of December 31, 2019, we have a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $37,259,800. The loss will be available to offset future
taxable income. If not used, this carry forward will expire as follows:
2030 $ 1,000
2031 $ 63,800
2032 $ 345,900
2033 $ 1,840,300

2038 $ 7,315,400
2039 $ 4,391,100
2040 $ 4,464,500
As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. The 2019 net operating loss carry forward of
$4,464,500 does not expire under the Tax Cut and Job Act of 2017.

Note 13. Liquidity
We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow. As our operations grow, we expect to experience significant increases in our working
capital requirements. These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company’s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months
following the filing of this Form 10-K. Management has evaluated these conditions, and concluded that current plans will alleviate this concern. As
of December 31, 2019, we had $1,091,374 of cash on the balance sheet. We have continued to significantly reduce core operating expenses,
reducing total General and Administrative Expense in 2019 by $962,859, or 12%, as compared with 2018. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020,
the Company completed $3.825 million of funding. These financings included a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 cents
per share. Moreover, on March 23, 2020 the Company obtained extensions or conversion of its Milestone I and II Convertible Notes as described in
Note 14.
Management has concluded that these actions have alleviated the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the
Company cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of its action to generate liquidity, including the availability of additional financing, or whether
such actions would generate the expected liquidity as planned.
Note 14. Subsequent Events
On March 23, 2020, the Company completed additional funding including a Private Placement Offering for common shares priced at $0.50 per
share (subject to adjustment), resulting in the receipt of proceeds in the amount of $3.825 million and the issuance of 7,650,000 shares. The
investors of this Private Placement Offering will be granted O warrants to be eligible to purchase an additional 0.50 shares for every share issued to
each purchaser, exercisable for a period of 3 years at an exercise price of $0.60 per share, (subject to adjustment). If the volume-weighted average
trading price for the 20 consecutive trading days that conclude upon 6 months after the initial closing (the “Six Month Price”) exceeds or equals
$0.50 per share (the “Target Price”), the per share purchase price will not be adjusted. If the Six Month Price is less than the Target Price, the per
share purchase price will be automatically reduced to the Six Month Price, but in no event less than $0.35 per share, in which case the Company
shall issue to each investor, pro-rata based on such investor’s investment: (a) shares in a quantity that equals the difference between the number of
shares issued to such purchaser at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to such purchaser at closing at the Six Month
Price; and (b) a warrant for a number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference between the number of shares issued to such
investor at closing and the number of shares that would have been issued to such investor at closing at the Six Month Price, with an exercise price
equal to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six Month Price, but in no eventless than $0.45 per share. The exercise price per share for each
warrant will automatically adjust to the sum of $0.10 per share and the Six-Month Price, but in no event less than $0.45 per share. In addition, the
Company obtained a 24 month extension on $1,071,000 in principal, and conversion of $720,000 of principal of the Milestone I Convertible Notes at
a conversion price of $0.50 per share. The remaining $110,166 was extended for thirty days. The interest rate on the principal balance of the
extended Milestone I Convertible Notes was amended to 15%. Furthermore, the Company obtained a 12 month extension on $168,000 in principal,
and conversion of $1,128,000 in principal of the Milestone II Convertible Notes. The remaining $67,200 was extended for thirty days. The
Convertible Noteholders of the Milestone I and II Convertible Notes were granted additional interest depending upon their election to convert or
extend their Convertible Notes.
The impact of COVID-19 on the Company is evolving rapidly with events unfolding on a daily and weekly basis. The direct impact to our operations
has begun to take affect at the close of the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. Specifically, our business has been impacted by dining bans
targeted at restaurants to reduce the size of public gatherings. We have noted restaurant chains have closed operations and furloughed employees
which would preclude our single serve products from being served at those establishments for a number of weeks. Furthermore, many school
districts have closed regular attendance which could conceivably last to the end of the school year. This will directly impact the sales of our Bulk
Product into that sales channel. Our headquarters are located in Los Angeles, California, where the entire state has been issued a “shelter in place”
order from the Governor of California. Consequently, our staff in the headquarter office are working remotely until further notice. At this point, we
have not experienced a disruption in the supply chain for manufacturing our products. The developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid and
dynamic, and consequently, will require the Company to continue to monitor news headlines from government and health officials, as well as, the
business community.
