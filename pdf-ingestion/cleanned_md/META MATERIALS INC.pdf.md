Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Meta Materials Inc. (the “Company” or “META” or “Resulting Issuer”) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites.
The Company’s registered office is located at 85 Swanson Road, Boxborough, Massachusetts 01719, and its principal executive office is located at 1
Research Drive, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
The Company has generated a portfolio of intellectual property and is now moving toward commercializing products at a performance and price
point combination that has the potential to be disruptive in multiple market verticals. The Company’s platform technology includes holography,
lithography, and medical wireless sensing. The underlying approach that powers the Company’s platform technologies comprises advanced
materials, metamaterials and functional surfaces. These materials include structures that are patterned in ways that manipulate light, heat, and
electromagnetic waves in unusual ways. The Company’s advanced structural design technologies and scalable manufacturing methods provide a
path to broad commercial opportunities in aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, healthcare, consumer electronics, and data transmission.
Controlling light, heat, electricity, and radio waves have played key roles in technological advancements throughout history. Advances in electrical
and electromagnetic technologies, wireless communications, lasers, and computers have all been made possible by challenging the understanding
of how light and other types of energy naturally behave, and how it is possible to manipulate them.
Over the past 20 years, techniques for producing nanostructures have matured, resulting in a wide range of groundbreaking solutions that can
control light, heat, and electromagnetic waves at very small scales. Some of the areas of advancement that have contributed to these techniques
are photonic crystals, nanolithography, plasmonic phenomena and nanoparticle manipulation. From these advances, a new branch of material
science has emerged – metamaterials. Metamaterials are composite structures, consisting of conventional materials such as metals and plastics,
which are engineered by scientists to exhibit new or enhanced properties relating to reflection, refraction, diffraction, filtering, conductance and
other properties that have the potential for multiple commercial applications.
A metamaterial typically consists of a multitude of structured unit nano-cells that are comprised of multiple individual elements. These are referred
to as meta-atoms. The individual elements are usually arranged in periodic patterns that, together, can manipulate light, heat, or electromagnetic
waves. Development strategies for metamaterials and functional surfaces focus on structures that produce unusual and exotic electromagnetic
properties by manipulating light and other forms of energy in ways that have never been naturally possible. They gain their properties not as much
from their composition as from their exactingly designed structures. The precise shape, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement of these
nanostructures affect the light and other electromagnetic waves to create material properties that are not easily achievable with conventional
materials.
The Company has many product concepts currently in various stages of development with multiple potential customers in diverse market verticals.
The Company’s business model is to co-develop innovative products or applications with industry leaders that add value. This approach enables the
Company to understand market dynamics and ensure the relevance and need for its products.

Holography Technology
Holography is a technique where collimated visible wavelength lasers are used to directly write an interference pattern inside the volume of light-
sensitive material (photopolymer) in order to produce highly transparent optical filters and holographic optical elements. For some product lines
that require large surface areas, this is combined with a proprietary scanning technique, where the lasers, optically or mechanically, directly write
nano-patterns to cover large surface areas with nanometer accuracy.
META’s principal products that employ holography technology are its metaAIR® laser glare protection eyewear, metaAIR® laser glare protection
films for law enforcement and holoOPTIXTM notch filters. META co-developed its metaAIR® laser glare protection eyewear product with Airbus
S.A.S. It has been engineered to provide laser glare protection for pilots, military and law enforcement using META’s holography technology.
metaAIR® is a holographic optical filter developed using nano-patterned designs that block and deflect specific colors or wavelengths of light.
META launched metaAIR® with strategic and exclusive distribution partner, Satair, a wholly owned Airbus company and started producing and
selling metaAIR® in April 2019. The scale-up and specification for the raw photopolymer material used to produce the eyewear was successfully
finalized in late 2019 and commercialized in 2020. META launched its laser glare protection films for law enforcement use in late 2020. These films
are designed to be applied to face shields and helmet visors providing the wearer with the same type of laser glare eye protection afforded to pilots
by metaAIR® glasses while preserving peripheral vision critical to law enforcement duties. HoloOPTIXTM notch filters are optical filters that
selectively reject a portion of the spectrum, while transmitting all other wavelengths. They are used in applications where it is necessary to block
light from a laser, as in machine vision applications and in confocal or multi-photon microscopy, laser-based fluorescence instrumentation, or other
life science applications. HoloOPTIXTM notch filters were commercially launched by the Company in November 2020.
META has additional products in development that utilize its proprietary holography technology. Included in the holoOPTIX TM family of products
are holographic optical elements (“HOEs”). HOEs are a core component in the display of augmented reality smart glasses products, as well as (in
their larger version) in Heads-Up Displays (“HUDs”), in automobiles and aircraft.
Lithography Technology
Lithography is a process commonly used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, in which a light-sensitive polymer (photoresist), is exposed and
developed to form 3D relief images on the substrate, typically a silicon wafer of up to 300mm (11.8 inches) in diameter. In order to meet the
performance, fabrication-speed, and/or cost criteria required for many potential applications that require large area and low cost nanopatterning,
the Company has developed a new nanolithography method called “Rolling Mask” lithography (registered trademark RML®), which combines the
best features of photolithography, soft lithography and roll-to-plate/roll-to-roll printing capability technologies. Rolling Mask Lithography utilizes a
proprietary UV light exposure method where a master pattern is provided in the form of a cylindrical mask. These master patterns are designed by
the Company and over the years they have become part of a growing library of patterns, enriching the intellectual property (“IP”) of the Company.
The nanostructured pattern on the mask is then rolled over a flat surface area writing a nano-pattern into the volume of a photoresist, creating
patterned grooves, metal is then evaporated and fills the patterned grooves. The excess metal is then removed by a known post-process called lift-
off. The result is an invisible conductive metal mesh-patterned surface (registered trademark NANOWEB®) that can be fabricated onto any glass or
plastic transparent surface in order to offer high transparency, high conductivity and low haze smart materials.
The Company’s current principal prototype product in lithography technology is its transparent conductive film, NANOWEB®. The lithography
division operates out of the Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Metamaterial Technologies USA Inc. ("MTI US"). MTI US can produce meter-
long samples of NANOWEB®, at a small volumes scale, for industry customers/partners. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the Company has been
ordering and upgrading its equipment at its California facility to efficiently supply NANOWEB® samples in larger volumes. The Company has
recently installed its first roll-to-roll, NANOWEB® pilot scale production line at its Pleasanton, California facility. The line is configured for 300mm-
wide rolls of substrate. All the equipment passed factory acceptance tests prior to delivery and installation, and the line is currently being
optimized.
Page6

There are six NANOWEB®-enabled products and applications that are currently in early stages of development including:
• NANOWEB® for Transparent EMI Shielding
• NANOWEB® for Transparent Antennas
• NANOWEB® for 5G signal enhancement
• NANOWEB® for Touch Screen Sensors
• NANOWEB® for Solar cells
• NANOWEB® for Transparent Heating to de-ice and de-fog
More details of these products and applications can be found in META’s EDGAR filings and on META’s website at www.metamaterial.com.
The Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with Crossover Solutions Inc. to commercialize the NANOWEB® enabled products and
applications for the automotive industry and with ADI Technologies to help secure contracts with the US Department of Defense.
Nano-optic structures and color-shifting foils - the Company recently acquired Nanotech Security Corp. "Nanotech" which specializes in designing,
originating, recombining, and mass-producing nanotechnology-based films with application for a wide variety of products and markets. Nanotech
develops and produces nano-optic structures and color-shifting foils used in authentication and brand protection applications across a wide range
of markets including banknotes, secure government documents, and commercial branding. The Company’s nano-optic security technology
platforms include:
• KolourOptik®, a patented visual technology that is exclusive to the government and banknote market and combines sub-wavelength
nanostructures and microstructures to create modern overt security features with a unique and customizable optical effect.
KolourOptik® pure plasmonic color pixels produce full color, 3D depth, and movement used in security stripes and threads that are
nearly impossible to replicate.
• LiveOptik™, a patented visual technology that utilizes innovative nano-optics one tenth the size of traditional holographic structures
to create next generation overt security features customized to Nanotech’s customers’ unique requirements. LiveOptik™ delivers
multi-color, 3D depth, movement and image switches for secure brand protection stripes, threads and labels that are nearly
impossible to replicate.
• LumaChrome™ optical thin film security features are manufactured using precision engineered nanometer thick layers of metals and
ceramics to form filters designed to uniquely manipulate visible and non-visible light. This unique manipulation of light properties is
used to create specialized security features in the form of threads, stripes, and patches that are applied to banknotes and other secure
documents. By using sophisticated electron beam and sputtered deposition methods, Nanotech precisely controls the construction and
inherent properties to provide custom color-shifting solutions. An individual looking at these threads, stripes and patches sees an
obvious color shift (e.g. green to magenta) when the document or bank note is tilted or rotated

Wireless Sensing and Radio Wave Imaging Technology
META’s Wireless Sensing platform uses infrared and radio frequency (RF) transmitters and receivers to collect and measure a variety of biological
information enabling non-invasive and safe medical diagnostics. The platform requires the ability to cancel reflections (anti-reflection) from the skin
to reduce the natural impedance the skin provides to such signals and increase the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (“SNR”) of certain diagnostic instruments
used in conjunction with the platform. This reflection-cancelling requirement is satisfied using META’s proprietary metamaterial films that employ
patterned designs, printed on metal-dielectric structures on flexible substrates that act as anti-reflection (impedance-matching) coatings when
placed over the human skin in combination with medical diagnostic modalities, such as MRI, ultrasound systems, non-invasive glucometers etc. The
Company is developing a number of medical products that employ this proprietary technology. glucoWISETM, is in development as a completely
non-invasive glucose measurement device. It is being developed first as a benchtop medical device product, followed by a portable, pocket-size
product and ultimately as a wearable. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increasing the SNR by orders of magnitude has been demonstrated to
produce much higher resolution images with significant increases in imaging speed resulting in better patient throughput and potentially more
accurate diagnoses in imaging clinics. For example, the Company is developing metaSURFACE™ (also known as radiWISE™) an innovation which
allows an improvement in signal to noise ratio of up to 40 times for MRI scans. The metaSURFACE™ device consists of proprietary non-ferrous
metallic and dielectric layers that are exactingly designed to interact (resonate) with radio waves increasing the SNR.META is also researching the
use of its Radio Wave Imaging technology in breast cancer and stroke diagnosis.
The Company is developing wireless sensing and radio wave imaging applications from its London, UK office and its newly established Athens,
Greece office.

The Company employs a hybrid model for manufacturing of our high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites.
The Company provides research scale production of its products in-house to its customers in its lithography and holography business areas. The
Company is scaling up pilot scale production of its materials in its Pleasanton facility and Highfield Park facility. The Company has current capacity
in its Thurso facility to produce its banknote security and brand security product at commercial scale and it is expanding this capacity. In certain
instances where volume warrants, the Company will make available on a license basis, its equipment and proprietary processes to its customers or
to third party contractors to product its products for their needs.
The Company is constantly improving and investing in its manufacturing capabilities and the associated quality control and resource planning
infrastructure. The Company holds ISO9001 certification for its Highfield Park facility and it is pursuing additional certifications in its Thurso
facility.
Research And Development
The Company operates in a rapidly evolving industry subject to significant technological change and new product introductions and enhancements.
The Company believes that its continued commitment to research and development is a critical element of ability to introduce new and enhanced
products and technologies. The Company has historically invested more than forty percent (40%) of its operating expenses in its research and
development efforts and these activities are integral to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. The Company also increasingly seeks
to deploy its resources to solve fundamental challenges that are both common to, and provide competitive advantage across, its high-performance
functional materials and nanocomposites.
The Company believes that its success depends in part on its ability to achieve the following in a cost-effective and timely manner:
• enable its OEM customers to integrate its functional films into their products;
• develop new technologies that meet the changing needs of the vertical markets it has chosen to pursue;
• improve its existing technologies to enable growth into new application areas; and expand its intellectual property portfolio
Intellectual Property
During 2021, the Company has expanded its patents and trademarks portfolio significantly in a wide range of applications including holography,
lithography, wireless sensing technology and nano-optic structures. In addition to META's previous portfolio of 126 patents, the Company acquired
more than 23 patents from Interglass Technology AG and 98 patents from the Nanotech acquisition The Company believes that its combination of
patents and additional IP that is being held confidential by way of multiple trade secrets provides the Company with an important competitive
advantage, marketing benefits, and licensing revenue opportunities.
Page10

Regulation
The Company is subject to significant regulation by local, state, federal and international laws in all jurisdictions in which it operates. Compliance
with these requirements can be costly and time consuming. The Company believes that its operations, products, services, and actions substantially
comply with applicable regulations in all jurisdictions. However, the risk of non-compliance cannot be eliminated and therefore there is no
assurance that future costs related to these regulations will not be incurred. There is also the possibility that regulations will be retroactively
applied, interpreted, or applied differently to the Company's operations, products, services, and actions which will require significant time and
resources.

Business Combinations
Torchlight RTO
On December 14, 2020, the Company (formerly known as “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” or “Torchlight”) and its subsidiaries, Metamaterial
Exchangeco Inc. (formerly named 2798832 Ontario Inc., “Canco”) and 2798831 Ontario Inc. (“Callco”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement
(the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Metamaterial Inc. ("MMI"), an Ontario corporation headquartered in Nova Scotia, Canada, to acquire all of
the outstanding common stock of MMI by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act
(Ontario), on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Torchlight RTO”). On June 25, 2021, the Company
implemented a reverse stock split, changed its name from “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” to “Meta Materials Inc.” and changed its trading
symbol from “TRCH” to “MMAT”. On June 28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the
Arrangement was completed.
On June 28, 2021, and pursuant to the completion of the Arrangement Agreement, the Company began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol
“MMAT” while MMI common stock was delisted from the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”). At the same time, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of META, started trading under the symbol “MMAX” on the CSE. Certain previous shareholders of MMI elected to
convert their common stock of MMI into exchangeable shares in Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. These exchangeable shares, which can be
converted into common stock of META at the option of the holder, are similar in substance to common shares of META and have been included in
the determination of outstanding common shares of META.
For accounting purposes MMI, the legal subsidiary, has been treated as the accounting acquirer and the Company, the legal parent, has been
treated as the accounting acquiree. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business
Combination. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are a continuation of MMI consolidated financial statements prior to June 28,
2021 and exclude the balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and
statements of cash flows of Torchlight prior to June 28, 2021. See note 3 for additional information.

owned subsidiary of META purchased 100% of Nanotech’s common stock at CA$1.25 per share. In addition, the transaction price included the
settlement of certain Nanotech share awards outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the agreement, including the repurchase and
cancellation of 303,391 Nanotech restricted share units ("RSU") at a purchase price of CA$1.25 per RSU and the settlement of 4,359,000 Nanotech
in-the-money stock options at a purchase price equal to CA$1.25 per option, less the exercise price thereof. The consideration payable to
securityholders under the arrangement was payable in cash, resulting in a total purchase price of $71.6 million (CA$90.8 million).
Nanotech is incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. Nanotech’s head office is located at #505 - 3292 Production Way, Burnaby,
BC, Canada V5A 4R4. In addition, Nanotech owns and operates a manufacturing facility located in Thurso, Quebec.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The following factors could materially affect META’s business, financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in
evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
Risks That Could Affect the Company’s Financial Condition
Limited Operating History
The Company has a limited operating history, which can make it difficult for investors to evaluate the Company’s operations and prospects and may
increase the risks associated with investment in the Company.
The Company has incurred recurring consolidated net losses since its inception and expects its operating costs to continue to increase in future
periods as it expends substantial financial and other resources on, among other things, business and headcount expansion in operations, sales and
marketing, research and development, and administration as a public company. These expenditures may not result in additional revenues or the
growth of the Company's business. If the Company fails to grow revenues or to achieve profitability while its operating costs increase, its business,
financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects will be materially, adversely affected.
The Company is expected to be subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises for the foreseeable future, including challenges
related to laws, regulations, licensing, integrating and retaining qualified employees; making effective use of limited resources; achieving market
acceptance of existing and future products; competing against companies with greater financial and technical resources; acquiring and retaining
customers; and developing new solutions; and challenges relating to identified material weaknesses in internal control.
Access to Capital
The Company believes that current working capital will be sufficient to continue its business for at least the next twelve months. Should the
Company's costs and expenses prove to be greater than it currently anticipates, or should it change its current business plan in a manner that will
increase or accelerate its anticipated costs and expenses, such as through the acquisition of new products, the depletion of its working capital
could be accelerated. The Company presently has access to approximately one hundred and twelve million dollars of new funding through its
existing At the Market S-3 Shelf Registration (ATM). The Company believes that this funding is sufficient to enable it to fund its current working
capital needs well into 2024.
Page12

The Company may pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of
projects, debt financing, equity financing, or other means. The Company may not be successful in identifying suitable financing transactions in the
time period required or at all, and it may not obtain the capital it requires by other means.
The Company's ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and its limited operating
history.
Page13

Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership percentage of the Company's stockholders. Raising any such
capital could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of its equity securities because its assets would be owned by a larger pool of
outstanding equity. The terms of securities the Company issues in future capital transactions may be more favorable to its new investors, and may
include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of other derivative securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee
incentive plans, which may have a further dilutive effect.
The Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees,
securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash
expenses in connection with certain securities it may issue, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
Currency Fluctuations
The Company’s revenues and expenses are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, EURO, and Great British Pounds, and therefore are
exposed to significant currency exchange fluctuations. Recent events in the global financial markets have been coupled with increased volatility in
the currency markets. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Great British Pounds may have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and operating results. The Company may, in the future, establish a program
to hedge a portion of its foreign currency exposure with the objective of minimizing the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange movements.
With appropriate risk management and oversight this may be able to offset future risk, however a hedging strategy will result in additional
operating costs.
Costs of Maintaining a Public Listing
As a publicly traded company, there are costs associated with legal, accounting, and other expenses related to regulatory compliance. Securities
legislation and the rules and policies of the NASDAQ require listed companies to, among other things, adopt corporate governance and related
practices, and to continuously prepare and disclose material information, all of which add to a company’s legal and financial compliance costs. The
Company may also elect to devote greater resources than it otherwise would have on communication and other activities typically considered
important by publicly traded companies.
Risks That Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business
Customer Concentration
The Company relies on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had 3
customers that accounted for $3,307,914 or 81% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had 3 customers that
accounted for $807,912 or 72% of total revenue.
The Company currently derives a significant portion of its revenue from contract services between its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nanotech, and a
G10 central bank. The Company is developing a new security feature under a framework contract with this customer. There can be no assurance
that this project will be successful, or that will result in long-term production revenue for this security feature.
Risk of not developing new products, applications, and end markets for the Company's products
The Company's future success will depend in part on its ability to generate sales of its products as well as generating development revenue.
Current and potential customers may have substantial investment in, and know-how related to the Company's technologies. Customers may be
reluctant to change from incumbent suppliers or cease using their own solutions, or the Company's products may miss the design and procurement
cycles of its customers. Many target markets have historically been slow to adopt new technologies. These markets often require long testing and
qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes before admitting new suppliers or adopting new technologies.
Page14

Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that the Company effectively transfer production processes from research and
development to manufacturing and coordinate efforts with those suppliers to achieve increased production volume rapidly. If we are unable to
implement this strategy to develop new applications and end markets for products or develop new products, the business, financial condition,
results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any newly developed or enhanced products may not
achieve market acceptance or may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products by other companies.
Page15

Research and Market Development
Although the Company, itself and through its investments, is committed to researching and developing new markets and products and improving
existing products, there can be no assurances that such research and market development activities will prove profitable or that the resulting
markets and/or products, if any, will be commercially viable or successfully produced and marketed. A failure in the demand for products to
materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations and financial condition of the companies in which the Company has or will invest in, and consequently, on the Company.
Raw Material Source
The Company purchases its holographic raw materials from a tier 1 German manufacturer, which is a single source supplier. Disruption in supply
from this supplier for any number of factors may cause a material adverse effect on Holography-related products.
Change in Laws, Regulations and Guidelines
The current and proposed operations of the Company are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines relating to production, the conduct
of operations, transportation, storage, health and safety, medical device regulation and the protection of the environment. These laws and
regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require the Company to incur substantial costs associated with
compliance or alter certain aspects of its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain
aspects of the Company’s business plan and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of its planned operations.
The Company launched a new product metaAIR® in March 2019 to provide laser glare protection to pilots in the airline industry. Currently,
metaAIR® is not subject to any Federal Aviation Administration regulations, however, metaAIR® may become subject to evolving regulation by
governmental authorities as the metaAIR® market evolves further.
Integrating Past or Future Acquisitions
The Company has completed a number of acquisitions during its operating history. The Company has spent and may continue to spend significant
resources identifying and pursuing future acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks including: (1) difficulties in integrating the
operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies; (2) the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and
(3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any prior and future acquisitions or
to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired companies could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition, and results of operations. Any future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities, acquisition or
divestiture-related write-offs or the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities.
Regulatory Approval
The Company’s wireless sensing technology to enhance MRI and non-invasive glucoWISE® monitoring is under development. The Company has
performed many experiments on animals and humans, and will continue to perform additional experiments as needed to continue the development
of the related products.
These products have not yet completed clinical trials/regulatory approval processes, and there can be no assurance that trials will be successful, or
that approvals will be granted.
Insurance Coverage
Page16

The Company will require insurance coverage for a number of risks. Although management of the Company believes that the events and amounts of
liability covered by its insurance policies will be reasonable, taking into account the risks relevant to its business, and the fact that agreements with
users contain limitations of liability, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be available or sufficient to cover claims to which the
Company may become subject. If insurance coverage is unavailable or insufficient to cover any such claims, the Company’s financial resources,
results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
Page17

Privacy and Data Security Concerns
Personal privacy, information security and data protection are significant issues worldwide. The regulatory framework governing the collection,
use, and other processing of personal data and other information is rapidly evolving. The United States federal and various state and foreign
governments have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable
information and other data relating to individuals, and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related
to the online collection, use and dissemination of data.
The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations, standards and other actual or asserted obligations relating to
privacy, data protection and information security may be substantial, and they may require the Company to modify its data processing practices
and policies. Any actual or alleged noncompliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards, and other actual or asserted obligations may lead
to claims and proceedings by governmental actors and private parties, and significant fines, penalties or liabilities.
Risk of Inability to Protect our Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property Rights
The Company relies on a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, technical know-how and other
unpatented proprietary information to protect the Company's technologies, products, product development and manufacturing activities from
unauthorized use by third parties. The Company's patents do not cover all of its technologies, systems, products and product components and its
competitors or others may design around its patented technologies. The Company cannot guarantee that it has entered into appropriate
agreements with all parties that have had access to its trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information to adequately protect all such
information. The Company also cannot assure shareholders that those agreements will provide meaningful protection for its trade secrets, know-
how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. The Company's trade secrets, know-how or other
proprietary information could be obtained by third parties as a result of breaches of its physical or electronic security systems or its suppliers,
employees or consultants could assert rights to its intellectual property.
Risk that Industry Targets will not Adopt the Company’s Products
Holography Market-Aviation Industry
The Company launched its first product, a laser glare protection eyewear, named metaAIR®, in March 2019, with a primary focus on the aviation
market. The product offers unique performance and benefits over the competition and is the only industry-approved solution to date. The Company
has co-developed this product with Airbus through a strategic partnership. Airbus further extended its support by introducing the Company to
Satair, an Airbus-owned company, which became the global distribution partner for metaAIR® to the aviation market. Since 2016, Airbus and Satair
have invested a total of $2,000,000 for the product development and exclusive distribution rights to metaAIR®. Since the launch of metaAIR® in
March 2019, the Company has sold fifty units to its distributor Satair. The Company is currently in the process of increasing its marketing and sales
capacity.
Despite the Company’s close collaboration with the Airbus Group, with the impact of COVID-19 there can be no assurance that the aviation market
will accept the metaAIR® product at the expected market penetration rates and a slower than forecasted market acceptance may have a material
adverse effect on Holography laser glare protection related products and the Company’s financial position. The Company is pursuing ancillary
markets outside of the aviation industry for its metaAIR® laser protection eyewear such as in law enforcement and defense.
Lithography Product and Market-Automotive
Lithography related products have not yet reached required manufacturing maturity. The first pilot scale roll-to-roll line is expected to be ready for
low volume production during the second half of fiscal year 2022. Broader sales and production are expected to be launched in two to three years’
time after successful completion of automotive product qualification and product introductions. META believes that the automotive market is a
strategic high growth opportunity, however despite the Company’s close collaboration with automotive
Page18

partners, there can be no assurance that the automotive market will accept the NANOWEB® product at the expected market penetration rates and
a slower than forecasted market acceptance may have a material adverse effect on Lithography de-icing/de-fogging, transparent antenna and other
related products and the Company’s financial position.
Page19

Risks Related to Facilities and Human Resources
New Facility and Permits for Lithography Production
The Company is in the process of moving into a larger facility suitable to host the scale-up of production relating to Holography and Lithography.
Lithography is a wet chemistry process which requires specific approvals from the local government to allow use of certain chemicals and their
disposal.
Any delay in setting up the facility and receiving permits may impact launch and/or development of related products, and may have a material
adverse effect on Lithography and Holography related products and consequently on the Company’s financial position.
At present, the facility is expected to be complete during the second half of fiscal 2022.
Recruiting or Retaining Qualified Personnel.
The Company's ability to successfully manage and grow the business and to develop new products depends, in large part, on its ability to recruit
and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled technical, sales, service, management, and key staff personnel. Competition for qualified
resources is intense and other companies may have greater resources available to provide substantial inducements to offer more competitive
compensation packages.
Conflicts of Interest
Certain of the Company’s directors and officers are, and may continue to be, involved in other business ventures through their direct and indirect
participation in corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, etc. that may become potential competitors of the technologies, products and services
the Company intends to provide. Situations may arise in connection with potential acquisitions or opportunities where the other interests of these
directors and officers conflict with or diverge from the Company’s interests. In accordance with applicable corporate law, directors who have a
material interest in or who are a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with the Company are required, subject to certain
exceptions, to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the contract. In addition, the directors and
officers are required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the Company’s best interests. However, in conflict of interest situations, the
Company’s directors and officers may owe the same duty to another company and will need to balance their competing interests with their duties to
the Company. Circumstances (including with respect to future corporate opportunities) may arise that may be resolved in a manner that is
unfavorable to the Company.
Reliance on Management
The success of the Company is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, and good faith of its senior management team. Any loss
of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, or financial condition.
Monitoring unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of its intellectual property may have
already occurred or may occur in the future. The Company's failure to identify unauthorized use or otherwise adequately protect its intellectual
property could jeopardize its competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business. Moreover, any litigation in connection with
unauthorized use of its intellectual property could be time consuming, and the Company could be forced to incur significant costs and divert its
attention and the efforts of its employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenues and higher expenses, and it may not be successful in
enforcing its intellectual property rights.
Risks Related to Oil and Gas Assets Held for Sale
Series A Preferred Stock Dividends
Page20

In connection with the Arrangement, the Company declared a dividend of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to holders of record of its common
stock as of June 24, 2021. The Series A Certificate of Designation entitles the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to receive dividends, or Asset Sale
Dividends, comprised of the holder’s pro rata portion of the proceeds from the sale of the O&G Assets in the event that the Company consummates
one or more such transaction prior to the Sale Expiration Date. However, the Company may not be able to consummate any such transaction prior
to such date on terms that will permit itself to pay such dividends, or at all.
Page21

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Asset Sale Dividends from any O&G Asset Sale. Prior to declaring or paying any
dividend, the Company will deduct from the gross proceeds of an O&G Asset Sale various costs and expenses described in the Series A Certificate
of Designation, which include, among others, (i) costs and expenses the Company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale
transaction, (ii) costs the Company incurs following the consummation of the Arrangement with respect to the O&G Assets, (iii) taxes the combined
company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale, the payment of dividends to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and the
O&G Assets, (iv) liabilities the Company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale and (v) amounts paid or payable with respect to
outstanding debt, if any. In addition, the Company will also withhold an amount of 10% of the proceeds from each O&G Asset Sale, (“the Holdback
Amount”) to cover potential post-closing liabilities and obligations that the combined company may incur in respect of such transaction. If, after the
deduction and withholding of these amounts, there are no net proceeds available for distribution to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, then
the Company will not declare or pay a dividend with respect to that transaction unless and until any remaining funds from the Holdback Amount
are due to be distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock through a dividend, or the Company receives additional net proceeds from such
O&G Asset Sale (for example, as a result of post-closing payments or the release of escrowed funds).
In the event that any O&G Assets have not been sold in an O&G Asset Sale that is consummated prior to the Sale Expiration Date, the Company
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, declare a spin-off dividend to distribute beneficial ownership of the remaining O&G Assets to the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock. However, if the combined company cannot effect such spin-off dividend in a manner that is exempt from
registration under all applicable securities laws, the combined company will not declare the spin-off dividend and instead will use good faith,
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the value of the remaining O&G Assets or to distribute or provide the value of the remaining O&G
Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, so long as the Company is not required to divert the attention of management or incur material
expenses in excess of amount required to be reserved under the Arrangement Agreement. Thus, the Company, ultimately may not be able to deliver
the value of any remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.
Orogrande and Hazel Projects: Risks and Uncertainties.
The Company is in the process of selling or spinning out the O&G Assets. Such dispositions may result in proceeds to Series A preferred
shareholders in an amount less than they expect or less than the Company's assessment of the value of the assets. The Company does not know if it
will be able to successfully complete such disposition on favorable terms or at all. In addition, the sale of these assets involves risks and
uncertainties, including disruption to other parts of its business, potential loss of customers or revenue, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or
result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to the Company following any such divestiture.
For example, in connection with a disposition, the Company may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, which
may result in additional expenses. In addition, in connection with a disposition, the Company may be required to make representations about the
business and financial affairs of the business or assets. The Company may also be required to indemnify the purchasers to the extent that its
representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to certain potential liabilities. These indemnification obligations may require the Company
to pay money to the purchasers as satisfaction of their indemnity claims. It may also take longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated
benefits of this transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect
the Company's business and operating results.
Since the Closing of the Merger, META has loaned $15,000,000 to Torchlight, for use in relation to drilling activity required to maintain compliance
with the lease obligations associated with the Company’s O&G Assets. This loan is collateralized by Mr. Greg McCabe’s interest in the Orogrande
Project as well as by his current shares of Meta common stock. If the Company spins-out the O&G Assets, it may owe federal and/or state income
taxes but will not receive any cash to pay such taxes and therefore may need to increase the debt relating to the O&G Assets at the spin-out. If the
Company sells or spins-out the O&G Assets, there may be insufficient funds for us to be repaid on these debts. The O&G Assets may never be able
to repay these debts to Meta and the collateral may also be insufficient.
Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Page22

Oil and Gas Operations Liability or Damages
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions,
uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These
hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to the Company from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction
of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and
penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, the Company may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property
purchased and leased by itself. In recent years, there has also been increased scrutiny on the environmental risk associated with hydraulic
fracturing, such as underground migration and surface spillage or mishandling of fracturing fluids including chemical additives. This technology
has evolved and continues to evolve and become more aggressive. The Company believes that new techniques can increase estimated ultimate
recovery per well to over 1.0 million barrels of oil equivalent and have increased initial production two or three-fold. The Company believes that
recent designs have seen improvement in, among other things, proppant per foot, barrels of water per stage, fracturing stages, and clusters per
fracturing stage. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or
eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of the Company's properties and/or force it to expend
substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. The Company currently has no insurance to cover such losses and liabilities, and
even if insurance is obtained, it may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or
indemnified against could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operations. In addition, pollution and
environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Estimates of the Volume of Reserves and Value of Oil and Gas Assets
Estimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers and/or valuation firms may vary substantially
depending, in part, on the assumptions made and may be subject to adjustment either up or down in the future. The Company's actual amounts of
production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary
substantially from the estimates. Oil and gas reserve estimates are necessarily inexact and involve matters of subjective engineering judgment. In
addition, any estimates of its future net revenues and the present value thereof are based on assumptions derived in part from historical price and
cost information, which may not reflect current and future values, and/or other assumptions made by management that only represent our best
estimates. If these estimates of quantities, prices and costs prove inaccurate, The Company may be unsuccessful in expanding our oil and gas
reserves base with our acquisitions. Additionally, if declines in and instability of oil and gas prices occur, then write downs in the capitalized costs
associated with any oil and gas assets it obtains may be required. Because of the nature of the estimates of the Company's reserves and estimates
in general, reductions to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues may not be required in the future, and/or
that our estimated reserves may not present and/or commercially extractable. If the Company's reserve estimates are incorrect, it may be forced to
write down the capitalized costs and the estimated value of our oil and gas properties as shown on our balance sheet.
Decommissioning Costs are Unknown and May be Substantial
The Company may become responsible for costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines which it uses for
production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to
as “decommissioning.” The Company accrues a liability for decommissioning costs associated with its wells but have not established any cash
reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our
properties or if the Company's estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover
such decommissioning costs, the Company may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy
such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.
Challenges to the Properties May Impact the Company's Financial Condition.
Title to oil and gas interests is often not capable of conclusive determination without incurring substantial expense. While the Company has made
and intends to make appropriate inquiries into the title of properties and other development rights it has acquired and intends to acquire, title
defects may exist. In addition, the Company may be unable to obtain
Page23

adequate insurance for title defects, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. If title defects do exist, it is possible that the Company may lose
all or a portion of our right, title and interests in and to the properties to which the title defects relate. If the property rights are reduced, the
Company's ability to conduct exploration, development and production activities may be impaired. To mitigate title problems, common industry
practice is to obtain a title opinion from a qualified oil and gas attorney prior to the drilling operations of a well.
Page24

Continuing Drilling Obligations Under Leases May Not be Met.
The leases for the Orogrande properties include additional drilling requirements for 2022 and 2023 which may require the Company to raise
additional capital. The Company is intending to sell the leases in 2022 and transfer the ongoing obligations to the new owners, or spin out, the
leases. If such a transfer is not completed in a timely manner in 2022, the Company may be forced to attempt to raise additional capital for this
purpose or seek an extension from the lessor of the lease drilling obligations. The Company may be unable to raise additional funds on favorable
terms. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities, including convertible debt, or
through our at-the-market offering (the ATM) or other offerings, the Company's shareholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may
include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Incurring additional indebtedness would result in
increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt,
limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact the
Company's ability to conduct its business. The Company has no committed source of additional capital and if it is unable to raise additional capital
in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to it, it may not be able to meet the additional drilling requirements and the leases will be lost.
The Company's Ability to Maintain its Rights Under the Leases is Dependent on Numerous Factors Outside of its Control.
The leased assets are held for sale. The Company's ability to attract capital to enable on-going compliance with the lease obligations depends upon
numerous factors largely beyond our control. These factors include:
• oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;
• global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;
• the overall state of the financial markets, including investor appetite for debt and equity securities issued by oil and natural gas
companies and the effects of economic recessions or depressions;
• the ability to secure and maintain financing on acceptable terms;
• legislative, environmental and regulatory matters;
• oil and natural gas reservoir quality;
• the availability of drilling rigs, completions equipment and other facilities and equipment;
• the ability to access lands;
• the ability to access water for hydraulic fracturing operations;
• reliance on vendors, suppliers, contractors and service providers;
• shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;
• changes to free trade agreements;
• inflation and other unexpected cost increases, including with respect to materials and labor;
• prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates;
• royalty and tax rates;
• physical impacts from adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;
Page25

• transportation and processing interruptions or constraints, including the availability and proximity of pipeline and processing
capacity;
• technology failures; and accidents
Risks Related to Legal Matters
Litigation
The Company is currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future, all of which will
require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes, which may have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition, and negatively affect the price of its common stock.
The Company is, and may in the future become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of
business. For example, the Company currently has securities class action complaints pending against itself, its chief executive officer, and its chief
financial officer, asserting that they made false or misleading statements. The complaints seek monetary damages, costs and expenses. For more
information, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 28 – Commitments and Contingencies” of the
Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Page26

The Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or provide an estimate of potential damages, if any. The Company believes that the
claims in the securities class actions are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. Regardless, failure by the Company to obtain
a favorable resolution of the claims set forth in the complaints could require it to pay damage awards or otherwise enter into settlement
arrangements for which its insurance coverage may be insufficient. Any such damage awards or settlement arrangements in current or future
litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results or financial condition. Even if plaintiffs’ claims are not
successful, defending against class action litigation is expensive and could divert management’s attention and resources, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition and negatively affect the price of its common stock. In addition,
such lawsuits may make it more difficult for the Company to finance its operations in the future.
Ongoing Government Investigation by the SEC
In September 2021, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement, in a matter
captioned In the Matter of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. The subpoena requests that the Company produces certain documents and
information related to, among other things, the merger involving Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and Metamaterial Inc. The Company is
cooperating and intends to continue to cooperate with the SEC’s investigation. Investigations of this nature are inherently uncertain and their
results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, the SEC Investigation has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the
Company because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. The SEC Investigation could also result in reputational
harm to the Company, which, among other things, may limit its ability to obtain new customers and enter into new agreements with its existing
customers, or its ability to obtain financing, and have a material adverse effect on its current and future business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.
Risks Related to Disclosures and Financial Reporting
Material Weaknesses in Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over disclosure and financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Effective internal controls
are necessary for the Company to provide timely, reliable and accurate financial reports, identify and proactively correct any deficiencies, material
weaknesses or fraud and meet our reporting obligations. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Management identified material weaknesses in its
disclosure controls and its internal controls over financial reporting during fiscal year 2021. Remediation efforts place a significant burden on
management and add increased pressure on its financial reporting resources and processes. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate
these material weaknesses in a timely manner, or if any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over disclosure or financial reporting
are identified, the accuracy of our financial reporting and the Company's ability to timely file with the SEC may be adversely impacted. In addition,
if the Company's remedial efforts are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal controls occur in the
future, the Company could be required to restate our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of
operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material
weaknesses or deficiencies, subject the Company to regulatory investigations and penalties, harm its reputation, cause a decline in investor
confidence or otherwise cause a decline in its stock price.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
As of December 31, 2021, proved reserves were calculated by a third party Reserve Engineer related only to the Hazel Project. The total PV 10
value for the Hazel wells is $2,897,000. Reference table below. The reserve calculation, as prepared by the Engineer, does not include
consideration of the Company’s obligation to assign revenue from the Hazel wells to Masterson Hazel Partners LPC (“MHP”) totaling approximately
$5,000,000. The Company had granted MHP the option to acquire the Hazel Project in exchange for them conducting, and paying for, development
activity sufficient to maintain the Hazel mineral leases in good standing. The Option Agreement provided that if MHP declined to exercise the
option to acquire the property, they would be entitled to recover their cost of the development activity to the extent that the wells produced
revenues beyond the date of the option’s lapse until the total amount was reimbursed to them. MHP declined to exercise the option effective
September 30, 2021.
Net cash received, after expenses, from the Hazel wells for 2021 for the period after the termination of the Option Agreement total $147,490. These
funds were received by the Company in early 2022 and were promptly transferred to MHP as the first revenue transferred pursuant to the
obligation under the Option Agreement. This amount was recorded as a receivable as of December 31, 2021, with an offsetting payable to
acknowledge the obligation.
Since the remaining obligation to reimburse MHP exceeds the PV 10 value computed by our reserve engineer the net value to the Company of
reserves associated with the Hazel wells is $Nil. Although no reserve value is attributable to the Company, we have presented a table below to
disclose the reserve calculation detail.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no proved reserves. As of December 31, 2021, the Hazel Project consisted of two producing wells and
their related leases and the Orogrande Project consists only of unevaluated properties in progress of development for future production. As of
December 31, 2021 the Hazel Project has proved producing reserves and the Orogrande project has no proved nonproducing reserves. The
Oklahoma properties are marginal producing wells which are not economic in the context of proved reserve value. The estimates of our 2021
proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net
of estimated production costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property
related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and
amortization.

The increase in producing reserves from 2020 to 2021 from 0 to 152,000 BOE is related to a new producing well in the Hazel Project as well as
bringing a prior well in the Hazel Project back on line after it had been shut in in 2019. All of this activity was performed and paid for by MHP.
Reserve values as of December 31, 2021 are related to the two producing wells in the Hazel Project.
BOE equivalents are determined by combining barrels of oil with MCF of gas divided by six.
Since the Company has no remaining reserve value as of December 31, 2021 after consideration of the obligation to pass revenue through to MHP
under the terms of the Option Agreement, and there was no reserve value at December 31, 2020, Standardized Measure disclosures are not
presented here.
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, both proved and probable reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows, and present value are based on various assumptions, including those
prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we
Page30

believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities
of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies
The reserve estimates for 2021 for proved reserves, including PV-10 estimates, set forth above were prepared by PeTech Enterprises, Inc. for the
Company’s Hazel Project in Texas; no reserve estimates were prepared for the Oklahoma wells because they are marginally producing and are
uneconomic for reserve calculation purposes. The calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally
accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.
No reserve report has been prepared for 2020. The only properties that had measurable reserves at December 31, 2019 were sold on November 11,
2020 (effective November 1, 2020).
We do not have any employees with specific reservoir engineering qualifications in the company. We worked closely with PeTech Enterprises Inc. in
connection with its preparation of our reserve estimates for 2021, including assessing the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of the methods and
assumptions used in this process.
PeTech Enterprises, Inc. (“PeTech”), who provided 2019, 2020 and 2021 reserve estimates for our properties, is a Texas based family owned oil and
gas production and investment company that provides reservoir engineering, economics and valuation support to energy banks, energy companies
and law firms as an expert witness. PeTech has been in business since 1982. Amiel David is the President of PeTech and the primary technical
person in charge of the estimates of reserves and associated cash flow and economics on behalf of the company for the results presented in its
reserves report to us. He has a PhD in Petroleum Engineering from Stanford University. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of
Texas (PE #50970), granted in 1982, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation
Engineers. A copy of the PeTech is attached to this Annual Report.
Proved Nonproducing Reserves
As of December 31, 2021, our proved nonproducing reserves totaled -0- barrels of oil equivalents (BOE) compared to -0- as of December 31, 2020.
At the end of 2021 and 2020 reserves did not include any value for proved undeveloped properties. This was due to the loss of the leases relating to
the Hazel Project except for those leases on which the two producing wells are located, and we had no proved reserves on the Orogrande Project.
We made investments and development progress during 2021 to develop reserves in the Orogrande Project in the Permian Basin in West Texas. As
of December 31, 2021, 14 test wells have been developed in the Orogrande Project.
Our current drilling plans, subject to sufficient capital resources and the periodic evaluation of interim drilling results and other potential
investment opportunities, include drilling additional evaluation wells in the Orogrande Project to continue to derisk the project and obtain initial
production from the development efforts.

Hazel
During the year ended December 31, 2021, 23,422 barrels of oil net to our interest were produced at an average sale price of approximately $60.00
per bbl, although we received none of this revenue because all of it, after deducting expenses to produce the oil, was either received by MHP
directly during the time that the Option Agreement was in effect or credited towards the recoupment of drilling costs incurred by MHP pursuant to
the Option. We produced and sold Nil MCF of gas net to our interest.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 there was no production from the Hazel wells.
Quarterly Revenue and Production by State for 2021 and 2020 are detailed as follows:
Note that no production is included for the Hazel project. No revenue attributable to any production from the Hazel property is reported in the
Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 because all of it, after deducting expenses to produce the oil,
was credited towards the recoupment of drilling costs incurred by MHP pursuant to the Option Agreement. Reference above discussion for
production data related to the Hazel wells for 2021.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
On January 31, 2020, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Torchlight Energy, Inc. and Torchlight Energy Operating,
LLC were served with a lawsuit brought by Goldstone Holding Company, LLC (Goldstone Holding Company, LLC v. Torchlight Energy, Inc., et al.,
in the 160th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas). On February 24, 2020, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., Torchlight Energy, Inc., and
Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC timely filed their answer, affirmative defenses, and requests for disclosure. The suit, which sought monetary
relief over $1 million, made unspecified allegations of misrepresentations involving a November 2015 participation agreement and a 2016
amendment to the participation agreement. Torchlight denied the allegations and asserted several affirmative defenses including but not limited to,
that the suit is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, that the claims had been released, and that the claims were barred because of
contractual disclaimers between sophisticated parties. Torchlight also asserted counterclaims for attorney fees. On January 14, 2021, Goldstone
Holding Company, LLC dismissed its claims without prejudice, leaving Torchlight’s counterclaims for attorney fees as the only pending claim in the
case. On February 26, 2021, Torchlight filed a non-suit without prejudice on its counterclaims for attorney fees, leaving no claims in the case. The
court signed a final order disposing of the entire case on March 5, 2021. However, Goldstone Holding Company, LLC asked the court to re-instate
its claims, and a hearing was held on April 13, 2021. On June 16, 2021, the court signed an order denying the motion to reinstate Goldstone
Holding Company’s, LLC’s claims, and the case is closed.
On April 30, 2020, The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation, filed suit against Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation
Technologies. The suit seeks the recovery of approximately $1.4 million in costs incurred as a result of a tool failure during drilling activities on the
University Founders A25 #2 well that is located in the Orogrande Field. Working interest owner Wolfbone Investments, LLC, a company owned by
the Company's former Chairman Gregory McCabe, is a co-plaintiff in that action. After the suit was filed, Cordax filed a mineral lien in the amount
of $104,500 against the Orogrande Field and has sued the operator and counterclaimed against Hudspeth for breach of contract, seeking the same
amount as the lien. The Company has added the manufacturer of one of the tool components that the Company contends was a cause of the tool
failure. It was later discovered that Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies forfeited its charter to conduct business in the State of
Texas by failing to timely pay its franchise taxes, and the Company added members of the board of directors to the case pursuant to the Texas Tax
Code. It was recently disclosed that Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies is the subsidiary of a Canadian parent company,
Cordax Evaluation Technologies, Inc., who has also been added to the case. The suit, Hudspeth Oil Corporation and
Page35

Wolfbone Investments, LLC v. Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies, was filed in the 189th Judicial District Court of Harris
County, Texas. The Company’s current Chairman of the Board filed a special appearance after being served with citation, alleging that he was a
Canadian citizen with no meaningful ties to Texas. After discovery was conducted on this issue, the Company filed a nonsuit without prejudice for
this Defendant, dismissing him from the case. The remaining parties are currently engaged in preliminary discovery and are scheduling mediation.
On March 18, 2021, Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies filed a lawsuit in Hudspeth County, Texas seeking to foreclose its
mineral lien against the Orogrande Field in the amount of $104,500.01 and recover related attorney’s fees. The foreclosure action, Datalog LWT
Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies v. Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., was filed in the 205th Judicial District Court of Hudspeth County,
Texas. The Company is contesting the lien in good faith and filed a Plea in Abatement on May 10, 2021, seeking a stay in the Hudspeth County lien
foreclosure case pending final disposition of the related case currently pending in Harris County, Texas.
In September 2021, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement, in a matter
captioned In the Matter of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. The subpoena requests that the Company produces certain documents and
information related to, among other things, the merger involving Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and Metamaterial Inc. The Company is
cooperating and intends to continue to cooperate with the SEC’s investigation. The Company can offer no assurances as to the outcome of this
investigation or its potential effect, if any, on the Company or its results of operation.
Page36

On January 3, 2022, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned
Maltagliati v. Meta Materials Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-07203, against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer,
Torchlight’s former Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Torchlight’s former Chief Executive Officer. The complaint, purportedly brought on
behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s publicly traded securities from September 21, 2020 through and including December 14, 2021, asserts
claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) arising primarily from a short-seller report and
statements related to the Company’s business combination with Torchlight. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and
reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.
On January 26, 2022, a similar putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York
captioned McMillan v. Meta Materials Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00463. This complaint names the same defendants and asserts the same claims on
behalf of the same purported class as the Maltagliati action. The Company believes these actions (collectively, the “Securities Class Action”) have
no merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.
On January 14, 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Easter District of New York captioned Hines v.
Palikaras, et al., No. 1:22-cv-00248. The complaint names as defendants certain of the Company’s current officers and directors, certain former
Torchlight officers and directors, and the Company (as nominal defendant). The complaint, purportedly brought on behalf of the Company, asserts
claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, contribution claims under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and various state law
claims such as breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages in
favor of the Company, certain corporate governance related actions, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including
attorneys’ fees.

OVERVIEW
Meta Materials Inc. (the “Company” or “META” or “Resulting Issuer”) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites
specializing in metamaterial research and products, nanofabrication, and computational electromagnetics. The Company’s registered office is
located at 85 Swanson Road, Boxborough, Massachusetts 01719, and its principal executive office is located at 1 Research Drive, Halifax, Nova
Scotia, Canada.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s Business
During March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This has resulted in governments
worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. In response, the Company’s management implemented a Work-From-
Home policy for management and non-engineering employees in all of the Company’s locations for various periods through Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal
2021 as was required or deemed prudent by management. Engineering staff continued to work on given tasks and followed strict safety guidelines.
As of November 2021, the majority of the Company’s employees had returned to the workplace. Although the Company’s supply chain has slowed
down, the Company is currently able to maintain inventory of long lead items and is working with its suppliers to optimize future supply orders
COVID-19 has impacted the Company’s 2020 and 2021 sales of its metaAIR® laser protection eyewear product. Worldwide restrictions on travel are
significantly impacting the airline industry and purchasing of metaAIR® eyewear has not been the primary spending focus of airline companies
emerging from the financial impacts of COVID-19, however, the Company is pursuing sales in adjacent markets such as consumer, military and law
enforcement. The situation is dynamic and the ultimate duration and magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and financial effect
specific to the Company cannot be quantified or known at this time.
BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Throughout 2021, the Company’s activities were focused on its research and development efforts as well as expansion of its intellectual property
estate. As the Company moves into 2022, new emphasis will be placed on investments in pilot scale manufacturing of NANOWEB® products,
expansion of its production capacity in our banknote and brand security lines and more aggressive design, development and clinical testing of its
array of medical products. These efforts represent an efficient approach to monetizing the Company's intellectual property assets.
Highfield Park facility
Page42

The Company leased approximately 53,000 square foot facility in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the lease commencing on January 1, 2021. The
facility will host the Company’s holography and lithography R&D labs and manufacturing operations. The Company also amended this lease
agreement on June 9, 2021 to expand the leased space by approximately 15,000 square feet, reduce the annual rent for the 10-year term of the
lease and obtain from the landlord CA$0.5 million in cash to fund ongoing tenant improvements. In exchange, the landlord received 993,490 shares
of MMI common stock at CA$3.40 per share. As at December 31, 2021, the Company has purchased equipment for approximately $1.5 million as
well as spent $3.84 million on construction work. The Company will continue to incur additional construction and equipment costs through 2022.
Page43

Pleasanton facility
During 2021, the Company signed multiple lease amendments with its lessor in Pleasanton, California to expand the leased space of the facility in
the United States to include additional space of 14,379 square feet as well as extend the duration of the leased spaces until September 30, 2026.
The Company has spent approximately $4.3 million on equipment including its first pilot scale roll-to-roll line which is expected to be ready for low
volume production during the second half of fiscal year 2022. The Company has also spent $1 million on leasehold improvements
Thurso facility
As part of the Nanotech acquisition, the Company acquired property plant and equipment with an estimated fair value of $25.8 million including a
105,000 square foot facility in Thurso, Quebec. Approximately 35,000 square feet is being utilized for existing production capacity, and the
remaining 70,000 square feet is available to expand output to facilitate future growth.

Product sales include products, components, and samples sold to various customers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company
began earning revenue from development samples sold to certain customers. The $0.4 million increase in product sales in 2021 compared to 2020
is due to:
• $0.3 million in revenue from sale of development samples of NANOWEB®
• $0.1 million in Nano-optic product sales in Q4 2021 generated by Nanotech subsequent to its acquisition by the Company
• Incidental revenue generated by product sales of holoOPTIXTM to different customers
There was minimal change in product sales between 2019 and 2020.
Development revenue is comprised of revenue from contract services and other development revenue. The increase in development revenue of $2.6
million in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to:
• $1.7 million in revenue recognized by Nanotech from contract services subsequent to its acquisition by the Company. Nanotech
currently derives a significant portion of its revenue from contract services with a confidential G10 central bank. In 2021, Nanotech
entered into a development contract for up to $41.5 million over a period of up to five years. These contract services incorporate both
nano-optic and optical thin film technologies and are focused on developing authentication features for future banknotes.
Page44

• $1 million in revenue recognized subsequent to achieving performance conditions of the Cooperation Framework Agreement with
Covestro Deutschland AG.
• $0.2 million decrease in other development revenue with lower research and development revenue generated from customers in 2021
compared to 2020.
The increase in development revenue of $0.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019, is Primarily due to revenue recognized from statements of work
with different customers.
The increase of $0.7 million in cost of sales in 2021, compared to 2020, is primarily due to $0.17 million in cost of sales incurred by Nanotech
subsequent to its acquisition by the Company, as well as $0.16 million in cost of sales incurred in generating other product sales. There was
minimal decrease in cost of sales in 2020 compared to 2019.

reality, consumer electronics, automotive, and medical applications.
There was a minimal decrease in selling and marketing expenses in 2020 compared to 2019.
The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2021, compared to 2020, is primarily due to:
• $5.0 million increase in legal and audit expenses, primarily resulting from costs associated with the Torchlight reverse acquisition
("RTO") and Nanotech acquisition, as well as costs associated with listing on the NASDAQ.
• $6.2 million increase in consulting expenses primarily due to:
o $4.1 million of expenses relating to the management of, and maintenance of the Oil and Gas assets ("O&G assets") acquired via
the Torchlight RTO, including $3.1 million paid to consultants in the form of warrants as well as $0.9 million paid in cash.
Page45

o $1.2 million in advisory fees relating to the acquisition of Nanotech.
• $3.0 million increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to:
o $2.0 million increase due to incurring an additional $1.1 million in salaries expense for general headcount expansion in 2021 as
well as recording accrued bonuses of $0.9 million.
o $0.9 million in salaries expenses in relation to management of, and maintenance of the O&G assets acquired via the Torchlight
RTO.
• $3.9 million increase in investor related expenses due to:
o $2.7 million warrants and RSUs issued to non-employee consultants in 2021. The fair value of warrants was calculated based
on the Monte Carlo simulation valuation technique. The fair value of RSUs was calculated using the grant date share price.
Refer to note 14 in Item 8. "Financial Statements and supplementary data" for more details.
o $1.0 million in other expenses in relation to stock market support, investor communication and holding an annual stockholders
meeting.
• $1.6 million increase in rent and utilities due to the new lease for the Company's Highfield Park facility in Nova Scotia, Canada, the
expansion of the Pleasanton facility in California, the opening of new administrative locations in Boxborough, Massachusetts and
Plano, Texas, and new research and development office in Athens, Greece.
• $1.6 million increase in insurance costs due to the increased insurance requirements in the US resulting from the Company's
NASDAQ listing.
• $1.7 million increase in depreciation, amortization and impairment expense.
The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020, compared to 2019, is primarily due to:
• $1.1 million increase in legal and audit fees for work related to the preparation for the Torchlight RTO and the closing of the CPM
RTO, $0.2 million increase in investment banking services, and $0.2 million increase in investor related expenses due to preparation
for the acquisition of Torchlight.

The $0.2 million decrease in interest expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the settlement of certain of the Company's convertible
promissory notes and debentures, converted into MMI common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in less interest expense
being incurred.
The $0.3 million increase in interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a $5 million loan obtained from BDC and issued in April 2020 as
well as issuance of $1 million in unsecured convertible debentures in the first half of fiscal year 2020.
The increase in loss on financial instruments in 2021, compared to 2020, was due to the re-measurement of convertible financial liabilities with
carrying value of $12.0 million at the conversion dates and a recognition of a $40.2 million non-cash realized loss in the statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. The increase in the fair value of convertible financial liabilities was due to the increase in the Company’s stock price from
CA$0.66 as at December 31, 2020 to:
• CA$3.01 at February 16, 2021 when the Company converted unsecured convertible promissory notes of $4.4 million principal and
interest at a share price of CA$0.50 in accordance with the terms of the bridge financing;
• CA$3.01 at February 16, 2021 when the Company converted unsecured convertible debentures of $1.5 million principal and interest
at share price of CA$0.70 as per terms of the agreement and;
• CA$3.80 at March 3, 2021 when the Company converted secured convertible debentures of $4.3 million principal and interest at
share price of CA$0.70 pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Business Development Canada.
Each of the above referenced promissory notes and debentures included a conversion feature, exercisable at the option of the debt holder. For
accounting purposes, each of these conversion features was an embedded derivative in the note or debenture. The Company elected to account for
fluctuations in (a) the value of the liabilities driven by interest rate volatility and the Company’s credit risk and (b) the embedded derivatives driven
by fluctuations in the Company’s common stock share price, using the fair value option. This accounting method calls for the Company to measure
the fair value of the convertible financial liabilities at each balance sheet date and to record any non-cash adjustments relating to instrument-
specific credit risk in other comprehensive income, and non-cash adjustments relating to other factors in the statements of operations. If, as was
the case for the liabilities described above, the debt is converted, the valuations and any adjustments are to be recorded as of the date of such
conversion.
The fair value option also provides that the total revaluation adjustment, in this case $40.2 million, be recorded in common stock and additional
paid in capital along with the $10.2 million principal and interest portion, resulting in an increase to stockholders' equity despite the recording of
the $40.2 million loss in the statement of operations.
The recorded loss is a non-cash expense. The creditors of the Company exchanged their secured and unsecured debt for common stock of the
Company at conversion prices that were established at the time the instruments were created and, at which time, represented a conversion price
close to or higher than the then market price of the common stock. Had the Company been permitted to pay off the debts in cash at the time of
conversion, fewer shares would have been required to be issued and a lower loss would have been recorded.
Page47

However, the instruments prevented any pre-payment of the debts by the Company. The conversions had the beneficial effect of significantly
reducing the Company’s liabilities and eliminating broad-based security interests in all of the Company’s assets previously held by the creditors.
The $0.6 million increase in loss on financial instruments in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the re-measurement of convertible financial
liabilities with carrying value of $12.0 million at the conversion dates and a recognition of a $0.8 million non-cash realized loss in the statements of
operations and comprehensive loss.
The $13.0 million decrease in net other income in 2021, compared to 2020, is primarily due to costs incurred in relation to certain drilling activity
carried out by the company at its Oil and Gas ("O&G") properties, to remain in compliance with all aspects of the Company's lease obligations and
to satisfy the Continuous Drilling Clause ("CDC") with University Lands. The Company was successful in maintaining lease compliance and is
moving forward with the planned spin-out of the O&G assets.
The $0.6 million decrease in other income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the following:
• $0.4 million decrease in recognition of the fair value of the interest free component of the funding obligation.
• $0.6 million decrease in recognition of fair value gain on the ACOA loans.
• Offset by a $0.4 million increase in government assistance.

Deferred Tax recovery

$ $ $ % $ $ %
Income tax recovery 852,063 193,710 658,353 340% 83,549 110,161 132%
The Company records deferred income tax liabilities for some of its foreign subsidiaries in Canada and United Kingdom. The increase in income tax
recovery in 2021, compared to 2020, was driven by:
• an increase in accumulated losses, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, in the Company's foreign subsidiary in United
Kingdom.
• an increase in accumulated losses, intangibles amortization and changes in foreign exchange rates in Nanotech securities, the
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to its acquisition on October 5, 2021.
The increase in income tax recovery in 2020, compared to 2019, was driven by:
• an increase in accumulated losses, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, in the Company's foreign subsidiary in United
Kingdom.
The Company has not yet been able to establish profitability or other sufficient significant positive evidence, to conclude that its deferred tax assets
are more likely than not to be realized. Therefore, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not meet its financial obligations as they become due after use of currently available cash. The
Company has a planning and budgeting process to monitor operating cash requirements, including amounts projected for capital expenditures,
which are adjusted as input variables change. These variables include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to generate revenue from
current and prospective customers, general and administrative requirements of the Company and the availability of equity or debt capital and
government funding. As these variables change, the Company may be required to issue equity or obtain debt financing.
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46.6 million including $0.8 million in restricted cash compared to $1.4
million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020. In addition, and as of December 31, 2021, the Company holds short-term investments
amounting to $2.8 million (December 31, 2020: $Nil).
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s principal sources of liquidity included $147 million of cash obtained through the Torchlight
RTO, $14.0 million in cash obtained through convertible debt, $1.8 million in cash obtained through revenue and deferred revenue, and $1.1 million
in cash obtained through long-term and short-term interest-free debt.
The Company’s primary uses of liquidity included the Nanotech acquisition of $66.1 million net of cash acquired, salaries of $10.3 million, legal
and audit fees of $6.3 million, professional service fees of $11.0 million and, Oil and Gas drilling costs of $12.5 million.
The Company believes that its existing cash will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs as production capacity
begins to come on line. The Company may need to raise additional capital to expand the commercialization of its products, fund its operations and
further its research and development activities. Future capital requirements may vary materially from period to period and will depend on many
factors, including the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts, the capital expansion of its facilities in Halifax and
California and the ongoing investments to support the growth of its business.
Page49

The Company also has the option to raise equity through issuing common stock of up to approximately $112.5 million under an existing At-The-
Market equity program where the Company's shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-256632) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 28,
2021, and declared effective on June 14, 2021 (the “Registration Statement”).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing
basis. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable at that time, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies that reflect the Company's more significant estimates,
judgments and assumptions and which it believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results
include the following:
Revenue recognition – The Company’s revenue is generated from product sales as well as development revenue. The Company recognizes
revenue when it satisfies performance obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control of its products is transferred to its customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers in exchange for those products or services.
Revenue from the sale of prototypes and finished products is recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the
customer, generally on delivery of goods. The Company considers whether there are other obligations in the contract that are separate
performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of
prototypes, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financial components, non-cash consideration
and consideration payable to the customer (if any).
Revenue from development activities is recognized over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the
research activities and associated performance obligations identified within each contract have been satisfied.
Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually)
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.
The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test the reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative
assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50
percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, the
Company compares the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
goodwill is not considered impaired and the Company is not required to
Page52

perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the
difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.
Page53

Acquired intangibles - In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require
management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of
acquired technology and customer relationships. In valuing acquired intangible assets, the Company makes assumptions and estimates based in
part on projected financial information, which makes assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain, particularly for early-stage technology
companies. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible technology
assets include the revenue growth rate, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in
the determination of the fair value of acquired customer contract intangible assets include the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
As a result of the judgments that need to be made, the Company obtains the assistance of independent valuation firms. The Company completes
these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Although the Company believes the assumptions and estimates of fair value it has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are
based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and
subject to refinement. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates
or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records
adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that
existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or
liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are
recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Business combinations - The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these
identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation
of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are
amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement
period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.

Assets held for sale – The Company determines the fair market value of the oil and gas assets held for sale on a periodic basis using inputs from
Roth Capital Partners, LLC, a valuation firm skilled in the valuation of this class of assets. The Company estimated the fair value of the Orogrande
property at June 28, 2021 as the sum of the median of each of a range of fair values of identified drilling locations determined using numerous
assumptions including the number of drilling locations, forecasted production volumes per drilling location, fair value per barrel of forecasted
production volumes based on comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying a drilling
location risk factor (collectively, “drilling location assumptions”); and a range of fair values of the undeveloped land acreage determined using
numerous assumptions including the number of undeveloped land acres, fair value per acre for comparable transactions or entities with acreage
proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying an acreage risk factor (collectively, “undeveloped land assumptions”). The Company
estimated the fair value of the Hazel Property at June 28, 2021 using a discounted cash flow model. The significant estimates and assumptions used
by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the Hazel Project property at acquisition date included forecasted production volumes,
forecasted commodity prices, and the discount rate. The Company estimated the fair value of the O&G assets at December 31, 2021 by obtaining a
valuation study performed by Roth Capital Partners, LLC. The estimates involved are consistent with those outlined above for the June 28, 2021
valuation estimate.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
rates. Interest rate risk is minimized through management’s decision to primarily obtain fixed rate or interest-free debt. The Company’s funding
obligation and long-term debt have been obtained at a nil interest rate and the interest on the cash balances is insignificant. As a result, the
Company is not exposed to material cash flow interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company has transactional currency
exposures that arise from loans and receivables as well as purchases in currencies other than their functional currency such as Canadian Dollars,
Euros and Great Britain Pounds. Current exposure is not material at this time, as exchange rate impacts occur with a reasonable timeline of the
decision to make the expenditure. As a result, the Company does not enter into derivatives to hedge the exposure.
In the future, a hedging strategy may be enacted if long term contracts or operational cash flows create a requirement.

Meta Materials Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Meta Materials Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2022
expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Acquisition date fair value of a developed nanotechnology intangible asset in the acquisition of Nanotech Security Corp.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 5, 2021, the Company acquired Nanotech Security Corp. for $72.1
million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The Company measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair
value, which resulted in the recognition of a developed nanotechnology intangible asset of $14.8 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible
technology assets include the revenue growth rate, the royalty rate, and the discount rate.
We identified the evaluation of the acquisition date fair value of the developed nanotechnology intangible asset in the acquisition of Nanotech
Security Corp. as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the assessment of the revenue growth rate, royalty rate, and discount rate assumptions used
in estimating the acquisition date fair value involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. In addition, the estimated fair value was
sensitive to possible changes to the above estimates and assumptions.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the revenue growth rate by comparing
to historical results for the acquired entity and publicly available market data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and
knowledge, who assisted in:
• evaluating the Company’s discount rate assumption, by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed
using publicly available market data for comparable entities
• evaluating the discount rate applied to the developed nanotechnology intangible asset by comparing it to the weighted average return
on assets acquired in the Nanotech Security Corp. business combination and the internal rate of return of the Nanotech Security
Corp. business combination
• evaluating the Company’s royalty rate assumption, by comparing the selected royalty rate to ranges of royalty rates observed in
comparable royalty agreements.
Fair value of the Orogrande Project property and preferred stock liability
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a reverse acquisition of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.
on June 28, 2021. The assets acquired included certain oil and natural gas properties with a fair value of $72.6 million, of which $71.1 million of
the fair value related to the Orogrande Project property. The liabilities assumed included a preferred stock liability with a fair value of $72.6
million entitling the preferred stock owners to the net proceeds of the sale or spinout of the oil and natural gas properties. As a result, the fair value
measurement of the oil and natural gas properties, including the Orogrande Project property, also forms the basis for the fair value measurement of
the preferred stock liability as of June 28, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021. The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the
determination of the fair value of the Orogrande Project property as of June 28, 2021 and December 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the
Orogrande Project property was calculated as the sum of the median of each of:
• a range of fair values of identified drilling locations determined using numerous assumptions including the number of drilling
locations, forecasted production volumes per drilling location, fair value per barrel of forecasted production volumes based on
comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying a drilling location risk
factor (collectively, “drilling location assumptions”); and
• a range of fair values of the undeveloped land acreage determined using numerous assumptions including the number of undeveloped
land acres, fair value per acre for comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and
applying an acreage risk factor (collectively, “undeveloped land assumptions”).
We identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date and year-end fair value of the Orogrande Project property as a critical audit matter. A high
degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the drilling location and undeveloped land assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of the Orogrande Project property. Minor changes to these assumptions could have had a significant effect on the estimate of fair value of the
Orogrande Project property. Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate required specialized skills and knowledge.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the competence, capabilities and
objectivity of the independent valuation firm engaged by the Company. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge,
who assisted in:

property, including the determination of the number of drilling locations, forecasted production volumes per drilling location, drilling
location risk factors, number of undeveloped land acres, and acreage risk factor
• evaluating the Company’s determination of fair value per barrel of forecasted production volumes and fair value per acre by
comparing to publicly available market data for comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project
property.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Meta Materials Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Meta Material Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses, described below, on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the
Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and
the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Material weaknesses related to the following have been identified and included in management’s assessment:
• An ineffective control environment resulting from a lack of the required number of trained financial reporting, accounting, information
technology (IT) and operational personnel with the appropriate skills and knowledge of GAAP and with assigned responsibility and
accountability related to the design, implementation, and operation of internal control over financial reporting.
• The insufficient number of personnel described above contributed to an ineffective risk assessment process necessary to identify all
relevant risks of material misstatement and to evaluate the implications of relevant risks on its internal control over financial
reporting.
• An ineffective information and communication process resulting from: (i) insufficient communication of internal control information,
including objectives and responsibilities, such as delegation of authority; and (ii) ineffective general IT controls and ineffective
controls over information from service organizations, resulting in insufficient controls to ensure the relevance, timeliness and quality
of information used in control activities.
• As a consequence of the above, the Company had ineffective control activities related to the design, implementation and operations of
process level and financial statement close controls which had a pervasive impact on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. In addition, process-level automated control activities and manual control activities that are dependent upon information
derived from IT systems were also ineffective.
• An ineffective monitoring process resulting from the evaluation and communication of internal control deficiencies, including
monitoring corrective actions, not being performed in a timely manner.
The material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those consolidated financial statements.
The Company acquired Nanotech Security Corp. during the year ended December 31, 2021, and management excluded Nanotech Security Corp.
from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, Nanotech Security
Corp.’s internal control over financial reporting associated with 17% of total assets and 45% of total revenues included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company
also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Nanotech Security Corp.
Page59

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Form 10-K Item 9A under the header “Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

META MATERIALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Corporate information
Meta Materials Inc. (the “Company” or “META” or “Resulting Issuer”) is a developer of high-performance functional materials and nanocomposites
specializing in metamaterial research and products, nanofabrication, and computational electromagnetics. The Company’s registered office is
located at 85 Swanson Road, Boxborough, Massachusetts 01719, and its principal executive office is located at 1 Research Drive, Halifax, Nova
Scotia, Canada.
On March 5, 2020, Metamaterial Inc. (“MMI” or “Resulting Issuer”). and Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (“MTI”) completed a business
combination by way of a three-cornered amalgamation pursuant to which MTI amalgamated with a subsidiary of Continental Precious Minerals Inc.
(“CPM”), known as Continental Precious Minerals Subco Inc. (“CPM Subco”), to become “Metacontinental Inc.” (the “CPM RTO”). The CPM RTO
was completed pursuant to the terms and conditions of an amalgamation agreement dated August 16, 2019 between CPM, MTI and CPM Subco, as
amended March 4, 2020. Following the completion of the RTO, Metacontinental Inc. is carrying on the business of the former MTI, as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of CPM. In connection with the RTO, CPM changed its name effective March 2, 2020 from Continental Precious Minerals Inc. to
MMI. The common stock of CPM was delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange on March 4, 2020 and was posted for trading on the Canadian
Securities Exchange (“CSE”) on March 9, 2020 under the symbol “MMAT”.
For accounting purposes, the legal subsidiary, MTI, has been treated as the accounting acquirer and CPM, the legal parent, has been treated as the
accounting acquiree. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are
a continuation of MTI consolidated financial statements prior to March 5, 2020 and exclude the balance sheets, statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholder’s equity and statements of cash flows of CPM prior to March 5, 2020. See note 3 for
additional information.
On December 14, 2020, the Company (formerly known as “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” or “Torchlight”) and its subsidiaries, Metamaterial
Exchangeco Inc. (formerly named 2798832 Ontario Inc., “Canco”) and 2798831 Ontario Inc. (“Callco”), entered into an Arrangement Agreement
(the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Metamaterial Inc., an Ontario corporation headquartered in Nova Scotia, Canada (“MMI”), to acquire all of
the outstanding common stock of MMI by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act
(Ontario), on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Torchlight RTO”). On June 25, 2021, the Company
implemented a reverse stock split, changed its name from “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.” to “Meta Materials Inc.” and changed its trading
symbol from “TRCH” to “MMAT”. On June 28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the
Arrangement was completed.
On June 28, 2021, and pursuant to the completion of the Arrangement Agreement, the Company began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol
“MMAT” while MMI common stock was delisted from the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) and at the same time, Metamaterial Exchangeco
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of META, started trading under the symbol “MMAX” on the CSE. Certain previous shareholders of MMI elected to
convert their common stock of MMI into exchangeable shares in Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. These exchangeable shares, which can be
converted into common stock of META at the option of the holder, are similar in substance to common shares of META and have been included in
the determination of outstanding common shares of META.
For accounting purposes, the legal subsidiary, MMI, has been treated as the accounting acquirer and the Company, the legal parent, has been
treated as the accounting acquiree. The transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805 Business
Combinations. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are a continuation of MMI consolidated financial statements prior to June 28,
2021 and exclude the balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and
statements of cash flows of Torchlight prior to June 28, 2021. See note 3 for additional information.

2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation – These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The Company’s fiscal year-end is December 31. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Meta Materials Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company). All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Functional currency – Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Company and its subsidiaries are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).
Reporting Currency – The reporting currency of the Company is in US Dollars. The consolidated financial statements, and the financial
information contained herein, are reported in US dollars, except share amounts or as otherwise stated, as the Company believes this results in
more relevant and reliable information for its financial statement users.
• transactions and balances – Foreign currency transactions are recorded into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the associated transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from
the measurement at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the
statement of operations.
• translation – The results and financial position of all subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• Company’s assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet;
• Company’s income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates;
• Company’s resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, a separate component of equity.
Use of estimates – The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make
estimates and certain assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of goodwill, the
valuation of net assets acquired via business combinations; the valuation of oil & natural gas properties, and the valuation of financial instruments
measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents – The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents.
Inventory – Inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method (FIFO) for all
inventory. Inventory consumed during research and development activities is recorded as a research and development expense.
Long-lived assets – Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances
require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined
through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as
considered necessary.
Assets held for sale – Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. See Note 3 for further
discussion of assets held for sale.
Page68

Goodwill – Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually)
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.
The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test the reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative
assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50
percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, the
Company compares the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
goodwill is not considered impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill
allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.
Acquired intangibles – In accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require
management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of
acquired technology and customer relationships. In valuing acquired intangible assets, the Company makes assumptions and estimates based in
part on projected financial information, which makes assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain, particularly for early-stage technology
companies. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible technology
assets include the revenue growth rate, the royalty rate and the discount rate. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in
the determination of the fair value of acquired customer contract intangible assets include the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
As a result of the judgments that need to be made, the Company obtains the assistance of independent valuation firms. The Company completes
these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Business combinations - The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and
intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these
identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation
of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are
amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement
period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.
Leases - The Company is a lessee in several non-cancellable operating leases for buildings. The Company accounts for leases in accordance with
ASC 842 Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right-of-use
(ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.
For operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease
commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the lease
liability is initially measured in the same manner and date as for operating leases and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective-interest rate method.
The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before
the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The ROU asset is subsequently measured
throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments,
less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.
Government grants and assistance – Government grants are recognized at their fair value in the period when there is reasonable assurance that
the conditions attaching to the grant will be met and that the grant will be received. Grants are recognized as income over the periods necessary to
match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognized as income over the
useful life of the depreciable asset by way of government assistance.
Page69

The Company also receives interest-free repayable loans from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (“ACOA”), a government agency. The
benefit of the loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and
the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates. The fair value of the components, being the loan and the government grant,
must be calculated initially in order to allocate the proceeds to the components. The valuation is complex, as there is no active trading market for
these items and is based on unobservable inputs.
Page70

Revenue recognition – The Company’s revenue is generated from product sales as well as development revenue. The Company recognizes
revenue when it satisfies performance obligations under the terms of its contracts, and control of its products is transferred to its customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive from its customers in exchange for those products or services.
Revenue from the sale of prototypes and finished products is recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the
customer, generally on delivery of goods. The Company considers whether there are other obligations in the contract that are separate
performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of
prototypes, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financial components, non-cash consideration
and consideration payable to the customer (if any).
Revenue from development activities is recognized over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the
research activities and associated performance obligations identified within each contract have been satisfied.
Deferred revenue – consist of fees invoiced or paid by the Company’s customers for which the associated performance obligations have not been
satisfied and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company’s revenue recognition criteria described above.
Deferred revenue is reported in a net position on an individual contract basis at the end of each reporting period and is classified as current in the
consolidated balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within
one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is
expected to occur more than one year from the balance sheet date.
Fair value measurements – The Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements,
the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
• Level 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the
measurement date.
• Level 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
• Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available,
thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.
Fair value option – Under the Fair Value Option Subsections of ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments – Overall, the Company has the
irrevocable option to report certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair
value reported in the statement of operations. Any changes in the fair value of liabilities resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk
are reported in other comprehensive income.
Research and development – Research and development activities are expensed as incurred.
Page71

Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share
gives effect to all dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period including stock options, deferred stock units (“DSUs”), Restricted
Share Units ("RSUs"), and warrants which are calculated using the treasury stock method, and convertible debt instruments using the if-converted
method. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes all dilutive potential stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Stock based compensation – The Company recognizes compensation expense for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the award.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees that have a graded vesting schedule based on a
service condition only on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was,
in substance, multiple awards (the “graded-vesting attribution method”), based on the estimated grant date fair value for each separately vesting
tranche. For equity awards with a graded vesting schedule and a combination of service and performance conditions, the Company recognizes
stock-based compensation expense using a graded-vesting attribution method over the requisite service period when the achievement of a
performance-based milestone is probable, based on the relative satisfaction of the performance condition as of the reporting date.
For stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, compensation expense is recognized using the graded-vesting attribution
method over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed.
The measurement date for each tranche of employee awards is the date of grant, and stock-based compensation costs are recognized as expense
over the employees’ requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
The Company estimates the grant date fair value of awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and estimates the number of forfeitures
expected to occur. The Company may use other pricing models when applicable such as Monte-Carlo simulation. See note 15 for the Company’s
assumptions used in connection with option grants made during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements.
Income taxes – Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to
reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.
Authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only
after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an examination. Management has
reviewed the Company’s tax positions and determined there were no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial
statements. Company tax returns remain subject to Federal, Provincial and State tax examinations. Generally, the applicable statutes of limitation
are three to four years from their respective filings.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
ASU 2019-12
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on a prospective basis. The new standard was issued in December 2019 with the
intent of simplifying the accounting for income taxes. The accounting update removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740 Income Taxes and provides simplification by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption of
this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2020-09
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-09, Debt (Topic 470): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762. The
amendments in ASU 2020-09 amend rules focused on the provision of material, relevant, and decision-useful information regarding guarantees and
other credit enhancements and eliminate prescriptive requirements that have imposed unnecessary burdens and incentivized issuers of securities
with guarantees and other credit enhancements to offer and sell those securities on an unregistered basis. The adopted amendments relate to the
financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X,
and affiliates whose securities collateralize securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X. The amendments in ASU 2020-
09 are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2020-09 on January
1, 2021 and its adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
ASU 2020-10
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which updated various codification topics by clarifying or improving
disclosure requirements to align with the SEC’s regulations. The amendments in ASU 2020-10 are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2020, for public business entities. The Company adopted ASU 2020-10 on January 1, 2021 and its adoption did not have a material
effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
ASU 2021-04
In April 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260). This guidance clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s
accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options due to a lack of explicit guidance in the FASB
Codification. This guidance is effective for the Company's interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2021-08
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from
Contracts with Customers, which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a
business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance will be effective for the
Company's interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2021-10
In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government
Assistance, which improves the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the
types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial
statements. This guidance is effective for the Company's interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Acquisitions and preferred stock liability
Torchlight RTO
Arrangement
As discussed in note 1, on December 14, 2020, Meta Materials Inc. and its subsidiaries, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. and 2798831 Ontario Inc.
(“Callco”) entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of MMI.
On March 12, 2021, MMI’s annual general and special meeting was held and MMI’s securityholders approved the Arrangement and on June 11,
2021, approval was obtained from Torchlight shareholders through a special meeting.
On June 25, 2021, Torchlight effected a reverse stock split of its Common Stock, at a ratio of two-to-one, changed its name from “Torchlight Energy
Resources, Inc.” to “Meta Materials Inc.” and declared a dividend, on a one-for-one basis, of stock of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to
holders of record of Company Common Stock as of June 24, 2021.
On June 28, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement, the Arrangement was completed.
The stock of Company Common Stock, previously traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “TRCH,” commenced trading on the NASDAQ
under the ticker symbol “MMAT”.
Page74

Securities conversion
Pursuant to the completion of the Arrangement, each common share of MMI that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to June 28, 2021
was converted into the right to receive 1.845 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Resulting Issuer or stock of
Canco, which are exchangeable for shares of the Resulting Issuer at the election of each former MMI stockholder. In addition, all of MMI’s
outstanding options, deferred share units and other securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, and any other rights to acquire
MMI Common Stock were exchanged for securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, or other rights to acquire Resulting Issuer
Common Stock. Immediately following the completion of the RTO, the former security holders of MMI owned approximately 70% of the Resulting
Issuer Common Stock, accordingly, the former shareholders of MMI, as a group, retained control of the Resulting Issuer, and while Torchlight was
the legal acquirer of MMI, MMI was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes.
Reverse acquisition
Pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition since: (i) the shareholders of MMI owned
the majority of the outstanding common stock of the Company after the share exchange; (ii) a majority of the directors of the Company are also
directors of MMI; and (iii) the previous officers of the Company were replaced with officers designated by MMI. The Company and MMI remain
separate legal entities (with the Company as the parent of MMI). These consolidated financial statements are those of MMI prior to June 28, 2021
and exclude the balance sheets, results of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, and statements of cash
flows of Torchlight prior to June 28, 2021.
Measuring the Consideration Transferred
The accounting acquirer issued no cash consideration for the acquiree. Instead, the accounting acquiree issued its 196,968,803 common shares to
the owners of the accounting acquirer. However, the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred by the accounting acquirer for its
interest in the accounting acquiree is based on the number of equity interests the legal subsidiary would have had to issue to give the owners of the
legal parent the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. Accordingly, the consideration
transferred of $358,138,773 was based on the following calculation:
• The assumption that MMI would have issued 44,885,634 shares to Torchlight in order for MMI shareholders to own approximately 70% of
the outstanding Combined Company Stock at a share price of $7.96, the closing share price of MMI on June 28, 2021 to equal
$357,289,644.
• Adding the fair value of deemed issuance of Torchlight options and warrants that were outstanding at the time of acquisition.
• Deducting the estimated fair value of the previously existing unsecured promissory notes issued by MMI to Torchlight of $11,000,000 plus
interest. These notes were effectively settled pursuant to the closing of the Arrangement.
The fair value of the number of equity interests calculated in that way can be used as the fair value of consideration transferred in exchange for the
acquiree. The assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their pre-
combination carrying amounts.
Page75

Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements Post Reverse Acquisition
The consolidated financial statements reflect all of the following:
a) the assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying
amounts
b) the assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 805
Business Combinations
c) the retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination
d) the amount recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity
interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value
of the legal parent (accounting acquiree). However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued)
reflects the equity structure of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree)
All references to common stock, options, deferred share units, and warrants as well as per share amounts have been retroactively restated to
reflect the number of shares of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) issued in the reverse acquisition.
Pursuant to the completion of Torchlight RTO on June 28, 2021 and as a result of information presented post acquisition, the Company has made
the following changes to the purchase price allocation previously disclosed in the interim financial statements for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2021 in Form 10-Q:
• decreased the consideration by $169,592 and reclassed the preferred stock liability from the consideration value to the acquired
liabilities.
• decreased the value of the acquired oil and natural gas ("O&G") assets and the preferred stock liability by $197,608 and $5,306,354
respectively, to reflect the finalization of a third-party valuation study of the O&G assets as of June 28, 2021.
• decreased working capital by $1,034,288 as a result of recording pre-acquisition receivable of $3,404,866, liabilities of $865,650 and
reduce cash as of June 28, 2021 by $3,573,504. The pre-acquisition receivable represents shares issued before acquisition date where
the cash was received immediately after the acquisition date.
• As a result, the Goodwill balance has decreased by $4,244,265.
The Company believes that information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, however the Company is waiting for additional information necessary to finalize these fair values including assessment of any tax assets
and liabilities and tax position in different jurisdictions. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth below are subject to change.
The Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Notes receivable or payable represent unsecured promissory notes previously issued by MMI to Torchlight between September 20, 2020 to
February 18, 2021 for proceeds of $11,000,000 plus interest. These notes have been eliminated upon acquisition and subsequent consolidation (see
note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for further details).
2 Oil and natural gas properties and preferred stock liability
Valuation at acquisition
Acquired oil and natural gas properties include the Orogrande Project property in West Texas and the Hazel Project property in the Midland basin
in West Texas. Refer to note 5 for additional details.
The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of the Orogrande Project property and the
Hazel Project property as of June 28, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
The estimated fair value of the Orogrande Project property was calculated as the sum of the median of each of:
• a range of fair values of identified drilling locations determined using numerous assumptions including the number of drilling
locations, forecasted production volumes per drilling location, fair value per barrel of forecasted production volumes based on
comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and applying a drilling location risk
factor (collectively, “drilling location assumptions”); and
Page77

• a range of fair values of the undeveloped land acreage determined using numerous assumptions including the number of undeveloped
land acres, fair value per acre for comparable transactions or entities with acreage proximal to the Orogrande Project property, and
applying an acreage risk factor (collectively, “undeveloped land assumptions”).
The estimated fair value of the Hazel Project property was calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The significant estimates and
assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the Hazel Project property at acquisition date included forecasted
production volumes, forecasted commodity prices, and the discount rate.
The Company valuation concluded an implied enterprise value as of June 28, 2021 to be between $57.7 million and $101.1 million. The Company
recorded the fair value of the Orogrande Project property at $71.1 million and the fair value of the Hazel Project property at $1.5 million, totaling a
value of $72.6 million.
On June 11, 2021, Torchlight’s stockholders approved an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of
Torchlight’s preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Preferred Stock”), from 10,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. In addition,
Torchlight’s Board of Directors formally declared the Preferred Dividend and set June 24, 2021 as the Dividend Record Date.
On June 25, 2021, the Company declared a dividend, on a one-for-one basis, of shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the “Series A
Preferred Stock”) to holders of record of Torchlight’s common stock as of June 24, 2021. This preferred stock entitles its holders to receive certain
dividends based on the net proceeds of the sale of any assets that are used or held for use in the Company’s oil and gas exploration business (the
“O&G Assets”), subject to certain holdbacks. Such asset sales must occur prior to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 or (ii) the date which is six
months from the closing of the Arrangement, or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and the individual appointed to serve as
the representative of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Sale Expiration Date”). The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically be
cancelled once the entitled dividends have been paid.
As a result, the fair value measurement of the oil and natural gas properties also forms the basis for the fair value measurement of the preferred
stock liability as of June 28, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021. The preferred stock liability is accounted for in accordance with ASC 480
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.
Page78

2021 developments
After the closing of the merger transaction with Torchlight, the Company engaged in a series of activities related to the oil and gas assets to ensure
that compliance with the relevant leases was maintained and that the lease rights retained their value in advance of a possible sale or other
disposition. The activities over a 4-month period were focused on the obligation to drill four wells on the subject leased property by year-end 2021
to ensure continued compliance with the lease requirements. The activities included assembly of a team of professionals to manage the efforts,
permitting, site preparation, drilling equipment rentals, pad preparations at each of the four sites and a variety of site clean-up, data summarization
and similar activities. In 2021, the Company invested approximately $14.2 million in these activities to preserve compliance and the value of the
assets. These costs were initially capitalized and then assessed at December 31, 2021 to determine if an adjustment was required to the carrying
value based on the updated fair value determination. In addition to the drilling activities, the Company organized a new wholly owned subsidiary to
enable consolidation of the leases into one company to help facilitate any future sale or other disposition of the assets and provide additional
structural alternatives for such sale or disposition.
Valuation at December 31, 2021
The Company continues to actively explore the sale of the assets or spinout, should a sale not occur. The Company estimated the fair value of the
O&G assets by obtaining a valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm. The estimates involved are consistent with those outlined
above as part of the acquisition. The valuation concluded an implied enterprise value as of December 31, 2021 to be between $55.1 million and
$109.0 million. The Company recorded the fair value of the Orogrande Project property at $72.0 million and the fair value of the Hazel Project
property at $3.5 million, totaling a value of $75.5 million.
There are 164,923,363 outstanding Series A Non-Voting Preferred shares as of December 31, 2021.
3 Goodwill
Goodwill is attributed to the difference between the total consideration calculated above and deemed to be transferred by the accounting acquirer
(MMI) and, the total net assets of the accounting acquiree (Torchlight). Based on the market value of META's Stock on June 28, 2021, this resulted
in total “consideration” being transferred to Torchlight of approximately $358.1 million. Further, the net assets of Torchlight acquired by MMI has
been estimated to be approximately $144.8 million. The difference between the $358.1 million of consideration deemed to have been transferred
and the $144.8 million of net assets acquired results in goodwill of approximately $213.4 million. Torchlight is delivering a NASDAQ listed legal
entity in good standing that will provide the Company with ready access to significant capital sources in the future to fund its growth plans.
The company deemed it necessary to perform an annual test for impairment at December 31, 2021 due to market conditions. As at December 31,
2021 no impairment was found.
Revenue and losses from the Torchlight RTO since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $Nil and $15.8 million respectively.
Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included below as if the Torchlight RTO occurred
on January 1, 2020. This summary of the unaudited pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s results of
operations would have been had Torchlight been acquired at the beginning of 2020, nor does it purport to represent results of operations for any
future periods.

Nanotech acquisition
On August 5, 2021, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to indirectly acquire Nanotech Security Corp. (“Nanotech”). On
October 5, 2021, a wholly-owned subsidiary of META purchased 100% of Nanotech’s common stock at CA$1.25 per share. In addition, the
transaction price included the settlement of certain Nanotech share awards outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the agreement,
including the repurchase and cancellation of 303,391 Nanotech restricted share units ("RSU") at a purchase price of CA$1.25 per RSU and the
settlement of 4,359,000 Nanotech in-the-money stock options at a purchase price equal to CA$1.25 per option, less the exercise price thereof. The
consideration payable to securityholders under the arrangement was payable in cash, resulting in a total purchase price of $72.1 million (CA$90.8
million).
The Company believes that information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, however the Company is waiting for additional information necessary to finalize these fair values including assessment of any tax assets
and liabilities and tax position in different jurisdictions. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value set forth below are subject to change.
The Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date.
The preliminary allocation of consideration paid for the Nanotech acquisition is summarized as follows:
Amount
Consideration paid to acquire Nanotech outstanding common stock $ 69,214,652
Consideration paid to repurchase Nanotech restricted stock units (RSUs) 300,610
Consideration paid to repurchase Nanotech stock options 2,612,035
$ 72,127,297
Net assets (liabilities) of Nanotech:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,974,254
Accounts receivable 741,783
Trade payables (1,349,139)
Prepaid expenses 271,741
Inventory 126,326
Property and equipment 14,771,456
Intangibles 25,309,847
Deferred tax liability (859,394)
Goodwill 27,140,423
$ 72,127,297
The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax basis
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including certain contracts and obligations. Any additional adjustments to the purchase price
allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of acquisition.
The estimated fair value of acquired assets and liabilities has been measured as at the acquisition date based on a valuation report provided by a
third-party valuation expert.
Acquired property, plant and equipment acquired totaling $14.8 million is comprised primarily of a production facility in Quebec, Canada with an
estimated fair value of $6.0 million, as well as specialized machinery and equipment with an estimated fair value of $8.6 million.
Page81

Acquired intangible assets totaling $25.3 million include a developed optical thin film technology intangible asset ($0.2 million), a developed
nanotechnology intangible asset ($14.8 million) as well as a customer contract intangible asset for $10.3 million. The significant estimates and
assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible technology assets include the revenue growth rate,
the royalty rate and the discount rate. The significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination of the fair value of the
acquired customer contract intangible asset include the revenue growth rate and the discount rate.
The goodwill resulting from the transaction is attributable to different factors including assembled workforce, Nanotech's market potential, specific
purchase synergies, technical know-how and expertise, customer service capabilities, geographical presence, and manufacturing capabilities.
Revenue and losses from the Nanotech acquisition since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2021 were $1.8 million and $0.9 million respectively.
Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are included below as if the Nanotech acquisition
occurred on January 1, 2020. This summary of the unaudited pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s
results of operations would have been had Nanotech been acquired at the beginning of 2020, nor does it purport to represent results of operations
for any future periods.

CPM RTO
As outlined in note 1, on August 16, 2019, MTI entered into an Amalgamation Agreement (“Amalgamation Agreement”) with CPM, a Canadian
public company listed on the CSE in relation to a Reverse Takeover transaction of CPM by MTI (“CPM RTO”). On October 10, 2019, CPM
shareholders approved matters ancillary to the transaction and on November 25, 2019, MTI shareholders approved the CPM RTO. Subject to an
amendment to the Amalgamation Agreement dated March 4, 2020, the CPM RTO was completed on March 5, 2020.
The CPM RTO was completed by the way of three-cornered amalgamation, whereby MTI was amalgamated with CPM Subco and holders of stock of
MTI received common stock of MMI as consideration. Pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement, the holders of the common stock of MTI (“MTI
Common Stock”) and holders of MTI’s Class A-1 preferred stock of MTI received MMI Common Stock in exchange for their MTI Common Stock at a
ratio of 2.75 MMI Common Stock for each MTI Common Share or Class A-1 Preferred share held. Also pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement,
the holders of MTI’s Class A-2 preferred stock received 4.125 Resultant Issuer Common Stock for each Class A-2 preferred share held.
Upon completion of the CPM RTO, all of MTI’s outstanding options, deferred share units and other securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into, and any other rights to acquire MTI Common Stock were exchanged for securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible
into, or other rights to acquire MMI Common Stock. Immediately
Page82

following the completion of the CPM RTO, the former security holders of MTI owned approximately 86% of the Resulting Issuer Common Stock, on
a fully diluted basis; accordingly, the former shareholders of MTI, as a group, retained control of MMI, and while CPM was the legal acquirer of
MTI, MTI was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes. As CPM did not meet the definition of a business as defined in ASC 805
—Business Combinations, the acquisition is not within the scope of ASC 805 and was considered to be a reverse recapitalization.
Reverse recapitalization accounting applies when a non-operating public shell company (CPM) acquires a private operating company (MTI) and the
owners and management of the private operating company have actual or effective voting and operating control of the combined company. A
reverse recapitalization is equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private operating company for the net monetary assets of the public shell
corporation accompanied by a recapitalization with accounting similar to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill or other
intangible assets are recorded.
Since the transaction was treated as capital transaction in substance, the consideration transferred was assumed to equal the fair value of CPM’s
net monetary assets of $3,110,834. Consideration transferred was then allocated between stock and options based on the fair value of the options
deemed to have been issued. Accordingly, $212,566 has been allocated to options as outlined in consolidated Statements of changes in
stockholders’ equity with the remainder $2,898,268 allocated to common stock.
The carrying value of CPM’s assets and liabilities have been assumed to approximate their fair values, due to their short-term nature. The following
table summarizes the monetary assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the March 5, 2020 exchange rate of $1.00 CAD = $0.7454 USD:
Amount
Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,112,172
Marketable securities 3,274
Accounts receivable 20,277
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (24,889)
$ 3,110,834
The fair value of CPM’s 700,000 options issued has been estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
Amount
Risk free interest rate 0.83% - 0.96%
Expected volatility 117% -134%
Expected dividend yield 0%
Expected forfeiture rate 0%
Fair value of Resulting Issuer Common Share CA$0.62
Exercise price of the options CA$0.35
Expected term for directors resigning from CPM board 6 months
Expected term for a director continuing as Resulting Issuer director 8 years
Revenue and losses from the CPM RTO since the acquisition date were Nil since acquisition.
4. Related party transactions
As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, receivables due from a related party (Lamda Guard Technologies Ltd, or “LGTL”) were for a
nominal amount and $nil, respectively. On March 16, 2021, MMI converted an amount of $0.3 million owing to LGTL into 81,584 MMI common
stock for a price per share of CA$4.51. The conversion price
Page83

of CA$4.51 per share represented a 10% premium to the CA$4.10 closing price of MMI stock on the CSE at the close of business on March 12,
2021. MMI has recognized $0.2 million in common stock in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity at fair value at the time
of conversion and recorded the difference of $0.1 million between the fair value of the common stock and the carrying value of the extinguished
liability as a loss on debt settlement in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, related party payables due to LGTL were $Nil and $0.2 million respectively.
5. Assets held for sale
As of December 31, 2021, assets held for sale represented the acquired oil and natural gas properties from the Torchlight RTO. Refer to note 3 for
details of the fair value determination.
Orogrande Project, West Texas
On August 7, 2014, Torchlight entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation
(“MPC”), and Gregory McCabe, Torchlight prior Chairman. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and
conditions of the Purchase Agreement, Torchlight purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which held certain oil and gas assets, including
a 100% working interest in approximately 172,000 predominately contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. Mr. McCabe has, at his
option, a 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and
conditions of a participation and development agreement among Hudspeth, MPC and Mr. McCabe. Mr. McCabe also holds a 4.5% overriding
royalty interest in the Orogrande acreage, which he obtained prior to, and was not a part of the August 2014 transaction.
Effective March 27, 2017, the property became subject to a DDU Agreement which allows for all 192 existing leases covering approximately
134,000 net acres leased from University Lands to be combined into one drilling and development unit for development purposes. The term of the
DDU Agreement expires on December 31, 2023, and the time to drill on the drilling and development unit continues through December 2023. The
DDU Agreement also grants the right to extend the DDU Agreement through December 2028 if compliance with the DDU Agreement is met and the
extension fee associated with the additional time is paid.
On July 25, 2018, Torchlight and Hudspeth entered into a Settlement & Purchase Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Founders (and
Founders Oil & Gas Operating, LLC, former Operator), Wolfbone and MPC (entities controlled by Torchlight prior Chairman), which agreement
provided for Founders assigning all of its working interest in the oil and gas leases of the Orogrande Project to Hudspeth and Wolfbone equally.
Future well capital spending obligations remained the same 50% contribution from Hudspeth and 50% from Wolfbone until such time as the $40.5
million to be spent on the project.
The Company's outstanding drilling obligations includes five wells in 2022 and 2023. All drilling obligations through December 31, 2021 have been
met. The drilling obligations are minimum yearly requirements and may be exceeded if acceleration is desired.
The Orogrande Project ownership as of December 31, 2021 is detailed as follows:

Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
Effective April 4, 2016, a wholly owned subsidiary of Torchlight acquired from MPC a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the
Midland Basin. A back-in after payout of a 25% working interest was retained by MPC and another unrelated working interest owner.
In October 2016, the holders of Torchlight's outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (which were issued in July 2016) elected to convert into
a total 33.33% working interest in the Hazel Project, reducing Torchlight ownership from 66.66% to a 33.33% working interest.
On January 30, 2017, Torchlight entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and a Plan of Merger with an entity which was
wholly-owned by Mr. McCabe, which resulted in the acquisition of approximately 40.66% working interest in the 12,000 gross acres, 9,600 net
acres, in the Hazel Project.
Also, on January 30, 2017, the Company entered into and closed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Wolfbone. Under the agreement, Torchlight
acquired certain of Wolfbone’s Hazel Project assets, including its interest in the Flying B Ranch #1 well and the 40 acre unit surrounding the well.
Upon the closing of the transactions, Torchlight's working interest in the Hazel Project increased by 40.66% to a total ownership of 74%.
Effective June 1, 2017, Torchlight acquired an additional 6% working interest from unrelated working interest owners increasing its working
interest in the Hazel project to 80%, and an overall net revenue interest of 74-75%.
The Company has drilled six test wells on the Hazel Project to capture and document the scientific base in support of demonstrating the production
potential of the property.
Option Agreement with Masterson Hazel Partners, LP
On August 13, 2020, Torchlight's subsidiaries Torchlight Energy, Inc. and Torchlight Hazel, LLC (collectively, “Torchlight”) entered into an option
agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Masterson Hazel Partners, LP (“MHP”) and McCabe Petroleum Corporation. Under the agreement, MHP
was obligated to drill and complete, or cause to be drilled and completed, at its sole cost and expense, a new lateral well (the “Well”) on the Hazel
Project, sufficient to satisfy Torchlight’s continuous development obligations on the southern half of the prospect no later than September 30, 2020.
MHP has satisfied this drilling obligation. MHP paid to Torchlight $1,000 as an option fee at the time of execution of the Option Agreement. MHP is
entitled to receive, as its sole recourse for the recoupment of drilling costs, the revenue from production of the Well attributable to Torchlight’s
interest until such time as it has recovered its reasonable costs and expenses for drilling, completing, and operating the well.
In exchange for MHP satisfying the above drilling obligations, Torchlight granted to MHP the exclusive right and option to perform operations, at
MHP’s sole cost and expense, on the Hazel Project sufficient to satisfy Torchlight’s continuous development obligations on the northern half of the
prospect. Because MHP exercised this drilling option and satisfied the continuous development obligations on the northern half of the prospect,
under the terms of the Option Agreement (as amended in September 2020) MHP had the option to
Page85

purchase the entire Hazel Project no later than May 31, 2021 under the terms of a form of Purchase and Sale Agreement included as an exhibit to
the Option Agreement, at an aggregate purchase price of $12,690,704 for approximately 9,762 net mineral acres, and not less than 74% net
revenue interest (approximately $1,300 per net mineral acre).The option expired unexercised and concurrently, all of the Hazel Project leases
expired except for those leases relating to the two producing wells. The continuing leases cover approximately 645 gross acres, 516 net acres, in
the Hazel Project.

The Company performs the annual impairment test for goodwill at year-end, by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount,
including goodwill, as of December 31, 2021, using the market approach to determine fair value. As the reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its
carrying amount, the Company determined that goodwill was not impaired. The key assumption used to calculate the recoverable amount of
goodwill as of December 31, 2021 was the Company’s share price.

a) In November 2020, MMI entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with a shareholder, pursuant to which the shareholder will
provide up to CA$5,500,000 in debt financing (the “Bridge Loan”) to fund MMI’s continued operations while MMI worked toward completion of the
Proposed Transaction with Torchlight. Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, MMI was able to draw up to CA$500,000 monthly beginning in
November 2020. The Bridge Loan bore interest at the rate of 8% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The principal amount and any accrued but
unpaid interest was due and payable on the 10th business day after the closing of the Proposed Transaction, or on November 29, 2022, if the
Transaction did not close before that date. At the option of the holder, the Bridge Loan, or any portion of the Bridge Loan and accrued but unpaid
interest was convertible into MMI Common Stock at a conversion price of CA$0.50 per share, subject to customary adjustments. MMI had the
option to repay the Bridge Loan in whole or in part, without penalty, at any time on or after March 28, 2021.
MMI elected to measure the financial instrument at fair value. MMI subsequently remeasured the instrument on December 31, 2020 and recorded
fair value loss of $139,609 in the statements of operations. There was no change in instrument specific credit risk.
On February 16, 2021, the total Bridge Loan of $4,361,930 of principal and accrued interest was converted at CA$0.50 per share into 20,391,239
common shares, in accordance with the terms of the bridge financing. MMI has remeasured the instrument as of the conversion date and
recognized a non-cash realized fair value loss of $19,163,417 and the full amount of $23,656,365 was reclassified into the consolidated statements
of changes in stockholders’ equity.
b) On September 15, 2020, MMI entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Torchlight pursuant to which Torchlight loaned MMI
three unsecured convertible promissory notes totaling $11,000,000. These Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes bore interest at 8% annually,
with principal and interest due and payable on the maturity date. If MMI and Torchlight had not entered into a Definitive Agreement, or the
Definitive Agreement were terminated, then the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes and all
Page89

accrued and unpaid interest were convertible at the option of the holder into common stock of the Company at the conversion prices set out below.
The Company had the option to repay all or part of the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, without

On April 3, 2020, MMI issued CA$5,000,000 in Secured Debentures to BDC Capital Inc.(“BDC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Business
Development Bank of Canada. The Secured Debentures mature on October 31, 2024, and bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, payable
monthly in cash. In addition to the cash interest, the Secured Debentures accrued a non-compounding payment in kind (“PIK”) of 8% per annum.
The PIK may be reduced by up to 3% (reduced to as low as 5% per annum) upon meeting certain conditions. BDC may elect to have the PIK paid in
cash.
The Secured Debentures and the PIK are convertible in full or in part, at BDC’s option, into MMI common stock at any time prior to their maturity
at a conversion price of CA$0.70 (the “Conversion Price”) or MMI may force the conversion of Secured Debentures if MMI’s common stock are
trading on the CSE on a volume-weighted average price greater than 100% of the Conversion Price (i.e. greater than CA$1.40) for any 20
consecutive trading days with a minimum daily volume of at least 100,000 Common Stock.
MMI elected to measure the financial instrument at fair value. MMI subsequently remeasured the instrument on December 31, 2020, and recorded
a fair value loss of $1,376,979, of which $511,699 was recorded in other comprehensive income relating to instrument specific credit risk and
$865,280 was recorded in the statements of operations.
The secured debentures were subject to a covenant clause, whereby MMI was required to maintain a working capital ratio of no less than 3:1. The
working capital ratio excluded deferred revenue and deferred government assistance from current liabilities. MMI did not fulfil the ratio as
required in the contract and consequently, the secured debentures were reclassified as a current liability as at December 31, 2020.
On March 3, 2021, MMI forced the conversion of the Secured Debentures pursuant to the terms of the agreement with BDC. The total debentures
balance of $3,910,954 was converted at CA$0.70 per share into 14,155,831 common shares. MMI remeasured the liability as of the conversion date
and recognized a non-cash realized fair value loss of $16,408,482 and the full amount of $22,118,782 was reclassified into the consolidated
statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. All security interests held by BDC on assets of MMI were immediately discharged.

At-the-Market Equity Offering Program ("ATM")
On June 16, 2021, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. ("Torchlight”) entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Roth Capital
Partners, LLC (the “Agent”) to conduct an “at-the-market” equity offering program pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to
time at its sole discretion, shares (the "Placement Shares”) of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of
up to $100,000,000 (the “Shares”), through or to the Agent, as the Company’s sales agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales
Agreement, the Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Shares from time to time, based upon the Company’s instructions. The
Company has no obligation to sell any of the Shares, and may, at any time, suspend the sale of the Shares under the Sales Agreement upon proper
notice to the other party. The Sales Agreement will terminate upon the issuance and sale of all of the Shares through or to the Agent, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with its terms.
On June 21, 2021, the Sales Agreement was amended and restated to increase the aggregate offering price to up to $250,000,000.
The Company has provided the Agent with customary indemnification rights, and the Agent will be entitled to an aggregate fixed commission of

made in transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market offerings” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
including sales made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions, including on The NASDAQ Capital Market, at market prices or as otherwise
agreed to with the Agent.

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the stock options outstanding as at December 31, 2021 was 7.65 (December 31, 2020 – 8.36)
years. There were 1,500,000 and 13,402,080 stock options granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $6.27 and $0.39 per share
respectively during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.
The fair value of options granted was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted-average assumptions:
Year ended December 31,
2021 2020 2019
Dividend yield [%] — — —
Volatility 84% 52%-134% 84%-130%
Risk-free interest rate 0.73% 0.73% 1.21%
Expected term (in years) 1 year 7.48 years 8.67 years
The expected life of the stock options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that
may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of
future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

At December 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $91.3 million (2020: $34.7 million) that can
be used to offset future taxable income, and such NOLs, as well as timing differences from certain financial instruments, result in a gross deferred
tax asset of approximately $27.2 million (2020: $10.2 million). These NOLs begin to expire in 2028.
In evaluating its valuation allowance, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income
and recent financial performance. Due to uncertainty with respect to the ultimate realizability of these deferred tax assets, the Company has
recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $18.7 million (2020: $9.1 million) against its deferred tax assets.

19. Fair value measurements
The Company uses a fair value hierarchy, based on the relative objectivity of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 representing inputs
with the highest level of objectivity and Level 3 representing the lowest level of objectivity.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, grants and accounts receivables, due from (to) related parties
and trade and other payables approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The current portion of long-term
debt has been included in the below table.
The fair values of convertible promissory notes secured convertible debentures and unsecured convertible debentures are classified at level 3 as
they were accounted for under the fair value option election of ASC 825 and the estimated fair value was computed using significant inputs that are
not observable in the market.
The fair value of assets held for sale is classified at level 3 as the fair value of the O&G assets was estimated by obtaining a valuation study
performed by a third party valuation firm. Refer to note 3 for the significant estimates and assumptions used by the Company in the determination
of the fair value.
Page104

The fair value of the preferred stock liability is also classified as level 3 since the fair value measurement of the oil and natural gas properties forms
the basis for the fair value measurement of the preferred stock liability as of June 28, 2021 and as of December 31, 2021.
The fair values of the funding obligation, operating lease liabilities, and long-term debt would be classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, as
each instrument is estimated based on unobservable inputs including discounted cash flows using the market rate, which is subject to similar risks
and maturities with comparable financial instruments as at the reporting date.
Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows:
2021 2020
Financial liability Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value
Funding obligation $ 268,976 $ 170,338 $ 776,884 $ 571,839
Operating lease liabilities 4,370,635 6,149,369 270,581 270,641
Long-term debt 3,228,449 2,303,648 3,034,048 2,734,931

The net gain/loss on financial instruments for the years ending December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 represent non-cash gains/losses
resulting from remeasurement of the fair value of convertible financial liabilities at each balance sheet date or on conversion date using the fair
value option.
Each of the above referenced promissory notes and debentures included a conversion feature, exercisable at the option of the debt holder. For
accounting purposes, each of these conversion features is an embedded derivative in the note or debenture. The Company elected to account for
fluctuations in (a) the value of the liabilities driven by interest rate volatility and the Company’s credit risk and (b) the embedded derivatives driven
by fluctuations in the Company’s common stock share price using a method known as Fair Value option. This accounting method calls for the
Company to measure the fair value of the convertible financial liabilities at each balance sheet date and to record any fluctuations in the
Page110

values that as non-cash adjustments relating to instrument specific credit risk in the other comprehensive income and non-cash adjustments
relating to other factors in the statements of operations. If, as in the case of the liabilities described above, the debt is converted, the valuations and
any adjustments are to be recorded as of the date of such conversion.
The Fair Value option also provides that the total revaluation adjustment be recorded in Common Stock and additional paid in capital thus having
no impact on stockholders' equity despite the recording of the loss in the statement of operations.

[1] In June 2019, the Company entered into a statement of work (“SOW”) with a third party for the purchase of manufacturing equipment. The
SOW was initiated based on the Industrial and Regional Benefits general investment funding between the third party and the Government of
Canada. The Company received the funds in two tranches after achieving two milestones as per the SOW. The funds are repayable,
commencing three years from date of receipt, based on 10% of revenue from the sale of holographic film that is produced using the related
manufacturing equipment paid for under this funding obligation.
In June 2019, the Company achieved the first milestone and received CA$325,000 and in October 2019, the Company achieved the second
milestone and received CA$975,000. The Company has not sold holographic film related to this SOW to date.
Page111

[2] The amounts received under the agreement have been recorded at fair value by applying the effective interest rate method on the dates the
funding was received, using an estimated market interest rate of 15%. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company
recognized $401,186 as other income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In the year ended 2020, the
Company recognized a loss of $32,291 resulting from changes in repayment period of the obligation. The gain was recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to bring the
market interest rate to current rates and increased it to 19.17%. Following management discussions the revenue generation ability from the
manufacturing equipment bought under the funding obligation was reduced, resulting in a longer repayment period. The combination of
these two changes prompted the Company to recognize a gain of $471,004 for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

the existing right-of-use asset and operating lease liability and recognize a new right-of-use asset and an operating lease liability commencing June
2021.
On September 16, 2021, the Company signed an agreement to extend the lease term of its existing leased premises at Pleasanton, California, from

Legal Matters
On January 31, 2020, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Torchlight Energy, Inc. and Torchlight Energy Operating,
LLC were served with a lawsuit brought by Goldstone Holding Company, LLC (Goldstone Holding Company, LLC v. Torchlight Energy, Inc., et al.,
in the 160th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas). On February 24, 2020, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., Torchlight Energy, Inc., and
Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC timely filed their answer, affirmative defenses, and requests for disclosure. The suit, which sought monetary
relief over $1 million, made unspecified allegations of misrepresentations involving a November 2015 participation agreement and a 2016
amendment to the participation agreement. Torchlight denied the allegations and asserted several affirmative defenses including but not limited to,
that the suit is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, that the claims had been released, and that the claims were barred because of
contractual disclaimers between sophisticated note parties. Torchlight also asserted counterclaims for attorney fees. On January 14, 2021,
Goldstone Holding Company, LLC dismissed its claims without prejudice, leaving Torchlight’s counterclaims for attorney fees as the only pending
claim in the case. On February 26, 2021, Torchlight filed a non-suit without prejudice on its counterclaims for attorney fees, leaving no claims in
the case. The court signed a final order disposing of the entire case on March 5, 2021. However, Goldstone Holding Company, LLC asked the court
to re-instate its claims, and a hearing was held on April 13, 2021. On June 16, 2021, the court signed an order denying the motion to reinstate
Goldstone Holding Company’s, LLC’s claims, and the case is closed.
On April 30, 2020, The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation, filed suit against Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation
Technologies. The suit seeks the recovery of approximately $1.4 million in costs incurred as a result of a tool failure during drilling activities on the
University Founders A25 #2 well that is located in the
Page114

Orogrande Field. Working interest owner Wolfbone Investments, LLC, a company owned by the Company's former Chairman Gregory McCabe, is a
co-plaintiff in that action. After the suit was filed, Cordax filed a mineral lien in the amount of $104,500 against the Orogrande Field and has sued
the operator and counterclaimed against Hudspeth for breach of contract, seeking the same amount as the lien. The Company has added the
manufacturer of one of the tool components that the Company contends was a cause of the tool failure. It was later discovered that Datalog LWT,
Inc. d/b/a Cote rdax Evaluation Technologies forfeited its charter to conduct business in the State of Texas by failing to timely pay its franchise
taxes, and the Company added members of the board of directors to the case pursuant to the Texas Tax Code. It was recently disclosed that Datalog
LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies is the subsidiary of a Canadian parent company, Cordax Evaluation Technologies, Inc., who has
also been added to the case. The suit, Hudspeth Oil Corporation and Wolfbone Investments, LLC v. Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation
Technologies, was filed in the 189th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The Company’s current Chairman of the Board filed a special
appearance after being served with citation, alleging that he was a Canadian citizen with no meaningful ties to Texas. After discovery was
conducted on this issue, the Company filed a nonsuit without prejudice for this Defendant, dismissing him from the case. The remaining parties are
currently engaged in preliminary discovery and are scheduling mediation.
On March 18, 2021, Datalog LWT, Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies filed a lawsuit in Hudspeth County, Texas seeking to foreclose its
mineral lien against the Orogrande Field in the amount of $104,500.01 and recover related attorney’s fees. The foreclosure action, Datalog LWT
Inc. d/b/a Cordax Evaluation Technologies v. Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., was filed in the 205th Judicial District Court of Hudspeth County,
Texas. The Company is contesting the lien in good faith and filed a Plea in Abatement on May 10, 2021, seeking a stay in the Hudspeth County lien
foreclosure case pending final disposition of the related case currently pending in Harris County, Texas.
In September 2021, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement, in a matter
captioned In the Matter of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. The subpoena requests that the Company produces certain documents and
information related to, among other things, the merger involving Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and Metamaterial Inc. The Company is
cooperating and intends to continue to cooperate with the SEC’s investigation. The Company can offer no assurances as to the outcome of this
investigation or its potential effect, if any, on the Company or its results of operation.
On January 3, 2022, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York captioned
Maltagliati v. Meta Materials Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-07203, against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer,
Torchlight’s former Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Torchlight’s former Chief Executive Officer. The complaint, purportedly brought on
behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s publicly traded securities from September 21, 2020 through and including December 14, 2021, asserts
claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) arising primarily from a short-seller report and
statements related to the Company’s business combination with Torchlight. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and
reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.
On January 26, 2022, a similar putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York
captioned McMillan v. Meta Materials Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-00463. This complaint names the same defendants and asserts the same claims on
behalf of the same purported class as the Maltagliati action. The Company believes these actions (collectively, the “Securities Class Action”) have
no merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.
On January 14, 2022, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Easter District of New York captioned Hines v.
Palikaras, et al., No. 1:22-cv-00248. The complaint names as defendants certain of the Company’s current officers and directors, certain former
Torchlight officers and directors, and the Company (as nominal defendant). The complaint, purportedly brought on behalf of the Company, asserts
claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, contribution claims under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, and various state law
claims such as breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages in
favor of the Company, certain corporate governance related actions, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including
attorneys’ fees.
Contractual Commitments and Purchase Obligations
a) As highlighted in note 20, on January 29, 2021, the Company arranged an irrevocable standby letter of credit with TD in favor of Covestro for
EUR 600,000 in relation to the CFA agreement. In the event the Company fails to meet the performance milestones under the CFA, Covestro
shall draw from the letter of credit with TD. The letter of credit
Page115

was secured by restricted cash of CA$1,000,000 under a cash use agreement which has been recorded as long-term debt in the consolidated
balance sheets. In July 2021, the Company settled the long term debt and used its own funds as guarantee. Covestro has issued certificates of
reduction of $462,563 (ER 300,000) to reduce the letter of credit after completion of certain performance milestones. This will take effect in
Fiscal 2022. As at December 31, 2021, the letter of credit has an outstanding amount of EUR 600,000.
b) During 2018, the Company arranged a guarantee/standby letter of credit with RBC in favor of Satair A/S for $500,000 in relation to an
advance payment received. In the event the Company fails to deliver the product as per the contract or refuse to accept the return of the
product as per the buyback clause of the contract or fails to repay the advance payment in accordance with the conditions of the agreement
signed with Satair on September 18, 2018, Satair shall draw from the letter of credit with RBC. Borrowings from the letter of credit with RBC
are repayable on demand. The letter of credit from RBC is secured by a performance security guarantee cover issued by Export Development
of Canada. Further, this guarantee/standby letter of credit expires on October 5, 2022. As at December 31, 2021, no amount has been drawn
from the letter of credit with RBC.
c) On December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with a large aircraft manufacturer to co-develop laser protection
filters for space and aeronautical civil and military applications, metaAIR, and support the setup of manufacturing facilities for product
certification and development. The cooperation agreement includes financial support provided to the Company in the form of non-recurring
engineering costs of up to $4,000,000 to be released upon agreement of technical milestones in exchange for a royalty fee due by the Company
on gross profit after sales and distribution costs. The total royalty fee to be paid may be adjusted based on the timing of the Company’s sales
and the amount ultimately paid to the Company by large aircraft manufacturer to support the development.
d) Certain nano-optic products are subject to a 3% sales royalty in favor of Simon Fraser University (“SFU”) where certain elements of the nano-
optic technology originated. Royalties were $Nil during the period since acquisition date until December 31, 2021. In 2014, the Company's
wholly owned subsidiary, Nanotech, prepaid royalties that would offset against future royalties owed as part of the transfer of the intellectual
property from SFU, of which $197,016 remains prepaid as at December 31, 2021.
e) Product revenue associated with six patents acquired by Nanotech is subject to royalties. The Company agreed to share 10% of any revenues
related to the patents received from a specific customer for a period of two years and ongoing royalties of 3% to 6% on other revenues derived
from the patents for a period of five years. There were no royalties during the year ended December 31, 2021.
f) As at December 31, 2021, the Company had on-going commitments for maintenance contracts as follow:
2022 $ 292,125
2023 43,730
2024 3,105

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021.
Based on this evaluation, the Company's management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to
the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting described below, the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021.
However, giving full consideration to the material weaknesses, the Company has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a‑15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by and under the
supervision of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the
Company’s management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
management, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, using the criteria set forth in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021, due to material weaknesses in
internal control over financial reporting.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis.
Management has determined that it did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting due to the existence of the following
identified material weaknesses:
• An ineffective control environment resulting from a lack of the required number of trained financial reporting, accounting, information
technology (IT) and operational personnel with the appropriate skills and knowledge and with assigned responsibility and
accountability related to the design, implementation, and operation of internal control over financial reporting.
• The insufficient number of personnel described above contributed to an ineffective risk assessment process necessary to identify all
relevant risks of material misstatement and to evaluate the implications of relevant risks on its internal control over financial
reporting.
Page117

• An ineffective information and communication process resulting from: (i) insufficient communication of internal control information,
including objectives and responsibilities, such as delegation of authority; and (ii) ineffective general IT controls and ineffective
controls over information from a service organization, resulting in insufficient controls to ensure the relevance, timeliness and quality
of information used in control activities.
• As a consequence of the above, the Company had ineffective control activities related to the design, implementation and operation of
process level and financial statement close controls which had a pervasive impact on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.
• An ineffective monitoring process resulting from the evaluation and communication of internal control deficiencies, including
monitoring corrective actions, not being performed in a timely manner.
These material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements, which were corrected prior to the release of the consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, and also in immaterial misstatements, some of which were corrected prior to the release of the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control
over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has limited the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to exclude controls, policies and
procedures and internal controls over financial reporting of the recently acquired operations of Nanotech Security Corp. (acquired on October 5,
2021). The operations of Nanotech Security Corp. represent approximately 17% of our total assets and 45% of our total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2021.
KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting, which report expresses an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses
Management is continuing to evaluate and strengthen the Company's internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that management can
routinely prepare our financial statements under GAAP, meet the requirements of the Company's independent auditors and remain in compliance
with the SEC reporting requirements. These efforts are time consuming and require significant resource investment that the Company is committed
to making.
The Company is still developing and documenting the full extent of the procedures to implement to remediate the material weaknesses described
above, however the current remediation plan includes:
• Training the newly hired ERP specialist and Supply Chain and Procurement Director.
• Identifying and hiring additional key positions necessary to support the Company’s initiatives related to internal controls over
financial reporting, including but not limited to Technical Accounting, Transactional Accounting, IT Management and Analysts.
• Hiring consultants to assist with process improvements and control remediation efforts in targeted accounting, IT and operations
processes.
• Continuing on-going testing of policies and procedures implemented in late 2021 to assess their effectiveness.
• Formalizing its entity-wide risk assessment process, and documenting internal ownership of risk monitoring and mitigation efforts,
with improved risk monitoring activities and regular reporting to those charged with governance at an appropriate frequency.
Page118

• Finalize a delegation of authority matrix to enforce desired limits of authority for key transactions, events, and commitments, and
communicating these limits of authority to relevant personnel throughout the Company.
Changes in Internal Controls.
Except for the material weaknesses described above, no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls or internal controls, when
effective, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override
of the control. The design of any systems of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these
inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Individual persons may
perform multiple tasks which normally would be allocated to separate persons and therefore extra diligence must be exercised during the period
these tasks are combined.
Item 9B. Other Information.
Effective as of February 28, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company voted to promote Kenneth L. Rice to the position of Chief Operating
Officer. In this new role Mr. Rice will retain his duties as Chief Financial Officer and will assume management responsibility for Business

Setting Executive Compensation
Torchlight fixed executive base compensation at a level believed to enable Torchlight to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment
and to reward satisfactory individual performance and a satisfactory level of contribution to overall business goals. Also considered was the
compensation that was paid by companies believed to be competitors and by other companies with which Torchlight believed they generally
compete for executives.
In establishing compensation packages for executive officers, numerous factors are considered, including the particular executive’s experience,
expertise, and performance, the company’s overall performance, and compensation packages available in the marketplace for similar positions. In
arriving at amounts for each component of compensation, the Compensation Committee strived to strike an appropriate balance between base
compensation and incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee also endeavored to properly allocate between cash and non-cash
compensation (including without limitation stock and stock option awards) and between annual and long-term compensation.
Employment Agreements
On July 15, 2020, Torchlight entered into new one-year employment agreements with each of John Brda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and
Roger Wurtele, Chief Financial Officer. Their previous employment agreements expired in June 2020. Under the new agreements, Messrs. Brda and
Wurtele will continue to receive their same annual salaries of $375,000 and $225,000, with 36% and 20% of the salaries, respectively, continuing to
accrue unpaid until such time as the Board of Directors believes there is adequate cash for such payment, or as otherwise contemplated in the
employment agreement. Each individual will be eligible for a bonus at the Compensation Committee’s discretion. Each agreement provides that if
there is a “change of control” in the company (as defined in the agreement), the employee will be paid in one lump sum any amounts owed to the
employee under the agreement that are accrued and unpaid plus his salary that would be earned through the end of the term of the agreement.
Each employment agreement has a covenant not to compete and provides for expense reimbursement, four weeks of vacation and certain other
benefits.
Additionally, as part of their employment compensation, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Brda an option to purchase a total of up to
2,250,000 shares of common stock, including up to 375,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share and up to 1,875,000 shares at an
exercise price of $1.00 per share, and granted Mr. Wurtele an option to purchase a total of up to 750,000 shares of common stock, including up to
375,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share and up to 375,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The options were granted
under Torchlight’s Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Option Plan. The terms of the options of both executives provided that the options would
vest upon either (a) the approval by shareholders of a change of control occurring prior to July 15, 2021, or (b) the company entering into a letter of
intent with a third party prior to July 15, 2021 that contemplates a change of control, and the change of control transaction closes with that third
party (or an affiliate(s) of that third party) at a date not later than July 15, 2022; subject, however, to acceleration and earlier vesting of all of the
options in the event of (i) the termination of employment by the employee for “good reason” under his employment agreement or (ii) a
determination of the Compensation Committee, at its discretion. In the event of the death or disability of the employee prior to vesting or if the
company terminates the employee’s employment for reasons other than for “cause” under the employment agreement prior to vesting, the option
will still vest upon the
Page124

occurrence of the events described under clauses (a) or (b) above. The options, to the extent such options have not been exercised, will terminate
and become null and void on July 15, 2025, if and only if the options vest as described above, or on July 15, 2021, if the options do not vest as
described above, subject to the occurrence of the events contemplated under clause (b) above whereby the options would not terminate until July
15, 2022.

shares of common stock, including up to 187,500 shares at an exercise price of $1 per share and up to 937,500 shares at an exercise price of
$2.00 per share, and granted Mr. Wurtele an option to purchase a total of up to 375,000 shares of common stock, including up to 187,500
shares at an exercise price of $1 per share and up to 187,500 shares at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The options were granted under
our 2015 Stock Option Plan which plan was approved by stockholders on October 26, 2020.
The above number of options and exercise price are adjusted to reflect the 1:2 reverse stock split of the Torchlight's common stock effected
immediately prior to the closing of the Arrangement agreement.
Compensation of Directors
Torchlight had no standard arrangement pursuant to which directors are compensated for any services they provide or for committee participation
or special assignments. Historically, Torchlight granted stock options to directors on a year-to-year basis. On October 26, 2020, however,
Torchlight instead approved accruing cash payments to the board members, until such time as Torchlight had adequate cash on hand to pay any
such accrued amounts to the board members. Since that date, each independent member of the board has received $100,000 per annum, payable
$25,000 per quarter in advance to each such board member, with the fourth quarter of 2020 being pro-rated.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
Page128

The following table sets forth information, as of April 24, 2022, concerning, except as indicated by the footnotes below, (i) each person whom the
Company knows beneficially owns more than 5% of its common stock, (ii) each of its directors, (iii) each of its named executive officers, and (iv) all
of its directors and executive officers as a group. The table includes these persons’ beneficial ownership of common stock. The Company has
determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, it believes, based on the
information furnished to it, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. Applicable percentage ownership is based on
296,614,994 shares of common stock outstanding at April 24, 2022. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a
person and the percentage ownership of that person, the Company deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to stock options, DSUs or
warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after April 24, 2022. The Company did not deem these
shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise noted, stock options,
DSUs and warrants referenced in the footnotes below are currently fully vested and exercisable. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1% is
denoted with an asterisk (*).

Following the closing of the Merger, the Company issued indebtedness in the amount of $15,000,000 to Oilco Holdings, Inc. Such loan is secured
by shares of Common Stock held by Gregory McCabe and by Mr. McCabe’s interest in the development of the Orogrande Project. The value of the

Director Independence
All of the Company's current Board of Directors are considered independent except the Company's CEO, George Palikaras, who does not serve on
any of the Board’s respective committees. The definition of “independent” used herein is based on the independence standards of The Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC and as defined by SEC rules and regulations. The Board performed a review to determine the independence of these Directors
and made a subjective determination as to each of these directors that no transactions, relationships, or arrangements exist that, in the opinion of
the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director of Meta Materials Inc. In
making these determinations, the Board reviewed information provided by these directors with regard to each Director’s business and personal
activities as they may relate to the Company and its management.

Audit Committee’s Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
It is the policy of the Audit Committee to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services proposed to be performed by our independent
auditor. All audit and permitted non-audit services performed in fiscal 2021 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The process for such pre-
approval is typically as follows: Audit Committee pre-approval is sought at one of the Audit Committee’s regularly scheduled meetings following the
presentation of information at such meeting detailing the particular services proposed to be performed. The authority to pre-approve non-audit
services may be delegated by the Audit Committee, pursuant to guidelines approved by the Audit Committee, to one or more members of the Audit
Committee. None of the services described above were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the exception provided by the Exchange Act
rules.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) and has determined that the provision of such services
is compatible with maintaining KPMG’s independence for the period of time during which it has served as our independent auditor.
