SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS
Our business is subject to numerous material and other risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Report.
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
• We have incurred significant losses since inception and as such, you cannot rely upon our historical operating performance to make an
investment decision regarding our company.
• If our competitors are successful in obtaining approval for Abbreviated New Drug Applications for products that have the same active ingredients
as BELBUCA, Symproic or ELYXYB, sales of BELBUCA, Symproic or ELYXYB may be adversely affected.
• We may need to raise substantial additional funding to fund our operations or other strategic initiatives. If we fail to obtain additional financing,
we may be unable to continue to spend on commercialization activities (including those relating to BELBUCA and Symproic) or complete the
commercialization of other product candidates.
• Our long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks.
• Our term loan agreement with Pharmakon contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be required to make a
prepayment or repay the outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect under our loan agreement if a prepayment event or an event of default
occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
• Our failure to obtain government approvals or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations relating to our technologies could delay or limit
introduction of any proposed formulations and products and result in failure to achieve revenues or maintain our ongoing business.
• If users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market
acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.
• Our business involves environmental risks related to handling regulated substances which could severely affect our ability to develop our drug
delivery technology.
• Government and other efforts to reform the healthcare industry could have adverse effects on our company, including the inability of users of our
current and future approved products to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, which could lead to diminished market
acceptance of, and revenues from, such products.
• Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting requirements and regulations that could
adversely affect our business and financial results and condition.
• Our stock price is subject to market factors and market volatility, both generally and with respect to our industry and our company specifically.
As such, there is a risk that your investment in our common stock could fluctuate in value.
• Additional authorized shares of our common stock and preferred stock available for issuance may adversely affect the market for our common
stock.

PART I
ITEM 1. Description of Business
On February 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. or Collegium. Pursuant to the
merger agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary of Collegium, or Merger Sub, will
commence a cash tender offer, or the tender offer, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at a price per share of $5.60,
net to the seller of such shares in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. The completion of the tender
offer will be conditioned on at least a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock having been validly tendered into and not withdrawn from
the offer, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions.
Following the completion of the tender offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company, with our company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Collegium. The merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, with no stockholder vote required
to consummate the merger. In the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares of common stock held by us as treasury
stock, or owned by Collegium or Merger Sub or held by stockholders who are entitled to demand, and who properly demand, appraisal rights under
Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $5.60 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by
applicable law.
We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022. If the transaction is completed, it is expected that our common stock will be removed from
listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market and from registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 15
our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the transaction.

in the state of Indiana in 1997 and reincorporated as a Delaware-based corporation in 2002.
Background on Chronic Pain, Opioid Induced Constipation, Acute Migraine, Breakthrough Cancer Pain and Opioid Dependence
Chronic Pain
Chronic pain is often defined as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts us to possible injury,
chronic pain persists – often for months or even longer. Chronic pain may arise from an initial injury, such as back sprain, or there may be an ongoing
cause, such as an illness. Sometimes there is no clear cause. According to results from a National Health Interview Survey, there are over 25 million
American adults experiencing daily chronic pain, with over 10 million of these experiencing severe pain on a daily basis.
Treatment Landscape for Chronic Pain
The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing various formulations of existing molecules, as well as generic
versions of older, non-patent protected products. In 2021, according to data from IQVIA (NSP & NPA), the market for long-acting opioids in the U.S.
totaled approximately $2.4 billion in annual sales with just over 11 million prescriptions dispensed. However, prescription volume of long-acting opioids
declined over 8% in 2021 compared to 2020 amidst continuing efforts to curb misuse, abuse and overuse of opioids in order to address the ongoing
opioid overdose crisis.

A number of products are competitors to BELBUCA, including BuTrans from Purdue Pharma L.P., or Purdue, a transdermal formulation of
buprenorphine which also has a generic equivalent available. Other competitors are U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, ("DEA") Schedule II opioids.
Approximately 74% of the prescriptions for long-acting opioids are dispensed as a generic product.
In addition to product competition, there are other factors that have impacted the market for pain products in general. Opioids continue to garner
increased scrutiny based on the widespread problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. The FDA and other government agencies have taken an
increasing number of actions to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction.
• In July 2012, the Federal Drug Administration, ("FDA"), approved a class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program for the
extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an
accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA falls within the existing
class-wide REMS program.
• In August 2014, the DEA published its final ruling in the Federal Register moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab,
Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS and as
supported by the DEA’s own evaluation of
2

Table of Contents
relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and
oxycodone.
• In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ("HHS’"), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, issued
guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. CDC developed and published the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain to
provide recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations
focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain. The guidelines advocate use of non-pharmacologic therapy and non-opioid pharmacologic
therapy as first line therapy for chronic pain. When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians are advised to prescribe immediate-
release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting, or ER/LA, opioids and to prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Clinicians were directed
to reassess patient’s medication needs when considering doses of 50 morphine milligram equivalents, or MME or greater and should avoid
increasing total daily doses to 90 MME or greater. A sharp reduction in prescriptions among primary care physicians and an increase among
pain specialists are evidence of the shift in prescribing and in the dynamics of pain treatment.
• In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that
the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This was the first time the agency took steps to remove a currently marketed opioid
pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDA’s decision was based on a review of all available post-
marketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s
reformulation.
• In September 2017, the CDC removed the MME conversion factors for buprenorphine from its online oral MME data file. And, in 2018, it included
a statement in the MME data file noting “Buprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-
dependent manner as doses for full agonist opioids.”
• In May 2019, the Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force issued their Final Report on Pain
Management Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, Inconsistencies, and Recommendations. The report identified that one of the barriers in pain
management best practices “includes lack of coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine as well as the lack of education and training on
the proper usage of buprenorphine. There has been a lack of access to buprenorphine treatment for chronic pain.” The report then makes
recommendations that third-party payers should provide coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine treatment approaches. The report
also encouraged the primary use of buprenorphine when opioids are appropriate for chronic pain. In October 2019, the HHS issued a guide for
clinicians on how to appropriately reduce the dose for patients on long-term opioids. Within this guidance, it was noted that if patients on high
opioid dosages are unable to taper despite worsening pain and/or function with opioids, clinicians should consider transitioning the patient to
buprenorphine. The guide also noted that in addition to treating pain, buprenorphine has other properties that may be helpful, including less
opioid-induced hyperalgesia and easier withdrawal than full mu-agonist opioids, and less respiratory depression than other long-acting opioids.
• Beginning in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted a soft edit of 90 MME per day for patients, aligning with the 2016
CDC Guideline recommendation. A medication soft edit can be used to alert the pharmacist to a potential safety risk for the patient, but can
often be overridden after consulting with the prescriber.
Opioid Induced Constipation
Opioid analgesics are an important therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain. However, a common side-effect of opioid
therapy is opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, which is characterized by reduced bowel movement frequency, increased straining, sensation of
incomplete evacuation, and hard stools after the initiation of opioid therapy. Unlike many other opioid-related adverse effects, opioid-induced
constipation does not subside over time. According to the 2018 American Gastroenterological Association Institute Guideline on the Medical Management
of Opioid-Induced Constipation, OIC is estimated to affect 40% to 80% of patients taking chronic opioid therapy. One-third of patients with OIC report
skipping, reducing, or stopping use of opioids—despite experiencing an increase in pain—in an effort to have a bowel movement.
Treatment Landscape for Opioid Induced Constipation
First-line treatment for opioid-induced constipation typically involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions such
as laxatives and increased dietary fiber. However, these approaches are associated with sub-optimal efficacy and do not address the underlying
mechanism of OIC. OIC results from the specific effects of opioids on the gastrointestinal tract, differing mechanistically from other forms of constipation.
Therefore, medical management of this disorder requires targeted treatment.

Table of Contents
In 2010, Relistor injectable was approved by the FDA as the first peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, or PAMORA, for the treatment of
OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. The PAMORA mechanism of action targets the underlying cause of OIC, selectively blocking opioid actions at
peripheral μ-opioid receptors, including those in the enteric nervous system, without affecting analgesia in the central nervous system ("CNS"). In 2014,
Movantik was the first oral PAMORA approved for the treatment of OIC, with the oral formulation of Relistor approved in mid-2016. In March 2017,
Symproic was the third PAMORA approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain.
In addition to the PAMORA agents, Amitiza is also approved for the treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Amitiza is a chloride
channel 2 activator in the gut, which increases intestinal fluid secretion and enhances transit through the gut without altering sodium and potassium
serum concentrations.
In October 2018, the American Gastroenterological Association, or AGA, issued guidelines for the medical management of OIC to help reduce
practice variation and promote high quality and high-value care for patients suffering from OIC. For patients in whom traditional laxative therapy results
in sub-optimal symptom control, the AGA recommends the use of PAMORAs. Of the PAMORAs, Symproic is the only OIC therapy with a strong
recommendation and high quality of evidence from the AGA. Due to insufficient evidence, the AGA did not issue a recommendation regarding the use of
Amitiza in OIC.
In 2021, according to data from IQVIA (NSP & NPA), the PAMORA market totaled $373 million in annual sales. There were over 557,000 PAMORA
prescriptions dispensed, a slight increase of 1% over 2020 despite the overall decline in opioid prescribing in the U.S.
Acute Migraine
An acute migraine is a general term for a migraine attack that occurs fewer than fifteen days a month. An acute migraine is also known as an
episodic migraine. Migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms in addition to headache itself, including: nausea, vomiting,
numbness or tingling, sensitivity to light and sound. The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms and by ruling
out other causes. Migraine attacks may include aura.
Treatment Landscape for Acute Migraine
Although there are several approved prescription medications for acute migraine, there remains a large unmet need as current therapies have
limitations ranging from efficacy for a particular patient, to dosing, to side effects. Classes of some of the currently approved prescription therapies
include analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAIDs), ergotamines, triptans, ditans, and calcitonin gene-related peptides. ELYXYB (celecoxib)
oral solution is a selective COX-2 NSAID that may have the advantage of causing less gastrointestinal (GI) upset than the other approved NSAID for acute
migraine, Cambia (diclofenac potassium).
In 2021, according to data from IQVIA (NSP & NPA), the acute migraine market totaled $2.8 billion in annual U.S. sales, with over 18.1 million
prescriptions dispensed, an increase of over 8% from 2020.
Breakthrough Cancer Pain
Cancer patients often suffer from a variety of symptoms including pain as a result of their cancer or cancer treatment. Pain is a widely prevalent
symptom in cancer patients, and an estimated 50% to 90% of those with cancer also suffer from what is referred to as breakthrough cancer pain, or
BTCP. BTCP episodes have a rapid onset that peaks in three to five minutes and can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per
day.
Treatment Landscape for Breakthrough Cancer Pain
BTCP can be difficult to treat due to its severity, rapid onset and the often unpredictable nature. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of
short-acting opioid medications, including morphine and transmucosal immediate-release formulations of fentanyl (TIRF). The use of TIRF products for
breakthrough cancer pain has declined significantly over the past several years as clinicians have transitioned pain management for BTCP to non-
fentanyl based therapies.
Opioid Dependence
Opioid dependence is a medical diagnosis that is characterized by the inability of an individual to stop using opioids, either prescription opioids such
as morphine, hydrocodone and oxycodone, or illicit opioids such as heroin, even when it is in the best interest of the individual to do so. Opioid
dependence is a complex medical condition that often requires long-term treatment and care. The treatment of opioid dependence is important to
reduce both the associated health and social consequences and to improve the well-being and social functioning of people affected. According to the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2019, 1.6 million people in the U.S. had an opioid use disorder.

Table of Contents
Treatment Landscape for Opioid Dependence
Treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with coming off opioid prescription painkillers and
heroin. This allows the individual suffering from an addiction to opioids – along with counseling and support – to work toward recovery. On average,
treatment lasts several months, reflecting relatively high dropout rates, but a significant number of people remain on buprenorphine treatment
chronically, with nearly one-quarter of patients still on therapy after nine months.
Our BEMA Drug Delivery Technology
Our BEMA drug delivery technology consists of a small, bi-layered erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside the
cheek). BEMA films have the capability to deliver a rapid, reliable dose of drug across the buccal mucosa for time-critical conditions such as
“breakthrough” cancer pain or in situations where gastrointestinal absorption of an oral drug is not practical or reliable, or in facilitating the
administration of drugs with poor oral bioavailability.
We believe that the BEMA technology permits control of two critical factors allowing for better dose-to-dose reproducibility: (i) the contact area for
mucosal drug delivery, and (ii) the time the drug is in contact with that area, known as residence time. In contrast to competing transmucosal delivery
systems such as 1) lozenges, 2) buccal tablets and 3) matrix-based delivery systems placed under the tongue or sprayed in the oral cavity, BEMA
products are designed to:
• adhere to buccal mucosa in seconds and dissolve in minutes;
• permit absorption without patients being required to move the product around in the mouth for absorption, thus avoiding patient
intervariability;
• allow for unidirectional drug flow into the mucosa as a result of a backing layer on the side of the BEMA film facing into the patient’s mouth;
• provide a reproducible delivery rate, not susceptible to varying or intermittent contact with oral membranes; and
• dissolve completely, leaving no residual product or waste and avoiding patient removal, and the possibility for diversion or disposal of partially
used product.
We currently own the BEMA drug delivery technology.

The pharmaceutical industry and the therapeutic areas in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial regulatory
and technological changes. Developments by others may render our BEMA technology and marketed products noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be
unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market

factors. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others
diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase.
There have been a number of companies developing products utilizing various thin film drug delivery technologies. While numerous over-the-
counter pharmaceutical products have been brought to market in thin film formulations, few containing prescription products have been introduced in
the U.S. Among the products to receive FDA approval are BELBUCA, BUNAVAIL, and ONSOLIS (BDSI), Suboxone film (Indivior PLC) and Zuplenz (Midatech
Pharma PLC). Companies in the development and manufacture of thin film technologies include LTS, Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG, ARx, LLC and
Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as MonoSol Rx LLC, or Aquestive). In addition, a number of companies are developing improved versions of
existing products using oral dissolving, nasal spray, aerosol, sustained release injection and other drug delivery technologies. We believe that potential
competitors are seeking to develop and commercialize technologies for buccal, sublingual or mucosal delivery of various therapeutics or groups of
therapeutics. While our information concerning these competitors and their development strategy is limited, we believe our technology can be
differentiated because the BEMA technology provides for a rapid and consistent delivery, high drug bioavailability and convenient use based on how the
BEMA technology adheres to the buccal membrane and dissolves. Our clinical trials across a number of BEMA products have demonstrated that the
technology is an effective means of drug delivery that is well tolerated and offers convenience to patients.
Since 2016, we have utilized our own sales force, which provides us with significantly more control over commercialization efforts and greater
flexibility to accommodate future strategic options. We have left commercialization of our ONSOLIS product in ex-U.S. markets with partners. As of
February 2022, BELBUCA, Symproic and ELYXYB are supported by a field force of approximately 147 sales representatives, 17 regional sales managers
and three area directors.
BELBUCA (buprenorphine buccal film), CIII, for Chronic Pain
BELBUCA is a buccal film that contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III opioid, and was approved by the FDA on October 26, 2015 for use in patients
with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. BELBUCA is
differentiated from other opioids and has the potential to address some of the most critical issues facing healthcare providers treating chronic pain with
prescription opioids – abuse, misuse, addiction and the risk of overdose. As a Schedule III opioid, buprenorphine has less abuse and addiction potential
compared to Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone and morphine. Compared to currently marketed products and products under
development, we believe that BELBUCA is differentiated based on the following features:
• strong and durable efficacy in both opioid naïve and opioid experienced patients;
• Schedule III designation by DEA, which indicates less abuse and addiction potential compared Schedule II opioids, which include oxycodone,
hydrocodone and morphine;
• published studies have shown that buprenorphine’s physiologic effects reach a plateau, and this ceiling effect may result in a lower risk of
overdose related respiratory depression;
• favorable tolerability with a low incidence of constipation and low discontinuation rate;
• flexible dosing options with seven available strengths; and
• buccal administration to optimize buprenorphine delivery.
Because of the safety, tolerability and efficacy benefits associated with buprenorphine, we believe that BELBUCA should be the first-line long-acting
opioid for patients with pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatments, such as non-
opioids or immediate release opioids, are inadequate.
Additionally, in 2020 we completed a Phase I randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 6-period, placebo-controlled, crossover study to compare
the effects of BELBUCA and oral oxycodone hydrochloride (a full μ-opioid receptor agonist) on respiratory drive, as measured by the ventilatory response
to hypercapnia (VRH) in healthy recreational opioid users. The Phase I study demonstrated that:
• BELBUCA did not reduce respiratory drive at any dose (300, 600, or 900 mcg);
• oxycodone resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in respiratory drive;
• significant increases in tidal volume were observed for BELBUCA at all doses relative to oxycodone 60mg;
• pupil diameter appeared to decrease with both BELBUCA and oxycodone; however maximum decrease from predose was observed 2 hours after
administration of oxycodone 60 mg;
• blood plasma levels were similar among all BELBUCA doses and both oxycodone doses; and
6

Table of Contents
• single doses of BELBUCA and single oral doses of 30 mg and 60 mg of oxycodone were generally safe and well tolerated.
To conclude, this first study comparing the effects of BELBUCA vs. a CII full mu-opioid agonist on respiratory drive confirms the better respiratory
safety of BELBUCA over oxycodone hydrochloride:
• BELBUCA exhibited no impact on respiratory drive at any dose relative to placebo; and
• oxycodone demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory drive.
The results of this study support, validate, and provide clinically-meaningful data beyond previous studies showing buprenorphine's ceiling effect on
respiratory drive.
The primary results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) in National Harbor, MD, February 26
to March 1, 2020; additionally, the secondary outcomes were presented at PAINWeek 2020. Beyond nine abstracts which were submitted, accepted and
presented at scientific congresses in 2020, four manuscripts were published in 2020 in key scientific journals.
We believe that there are long-term growth opportunities for BELBUCA and we focus our commercial efforts primarily on BELBUCA.
Our sales force is focused on current BELBUCA prescribers and clinicians we believe have the greatest opportunity to be adopters of BELBUCA, such
as high prescribers of long-acting opioids, BuTrans/buprenorphine transdermal and/or HCPs who prescribe short acting opioids around-the-clock for
patients with chronic pain. In parallel, we are heavily focused on ensuring market access for BELBUCA. As of January 2022, BELBUCA had formulary
coverage for more than 90% of commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel in 2021 were approximately 89%. BELBUCA also
continued to have favorable approval rates of approximately 87% in Medicare Part D plans for the year.
In 2021, BELBUCA continued to have strong coverage with approximately 118 million lives having preferred access and around 250 million lives
having access to BELBUCA across all channels . BELBUCA total prescriptions in 2021, according to IQVIA NPA, totaled over 471,000, an increase of 9%
over 2020. BELBUCA's share of total buprenorphine prescriptions (products for the treatment of chronic pain only) for 2021 totaled 42%. In addition to a
steady increase in BELBUCA prescription volume through 2021, there was also an increase in the use of higher doses of BELBUCA as healthcare providers
continued to gain comfort titrating patients to higher optimal doses. In 2021, 52% of BELBUCA prescriptions were for doses of 450 mcg or greater,
compared to 48% in 2020. Therefore, the weighted average price per prescription continued to increase in 2021.
Symproic (naldemedine), for Opioid Induced Constipation
Symproic was approved by the FDA on March 23, 2017 for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain, including patients
with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Compared to currently
marketed products and products under development, we believe that Symproic is differentiated based on the following features:
• strong and durable efficacy observed in randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials of 12 week and 52 week duration in OIC
patients;
• OIC relief that was more frequent, more complete, with less straining than patients taking placebo;
• recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association for patients with laxative refractory OIC;
• adverse event profile comparable to placebo, with low rates of abdominal pain observed across the phase III program; and
• the only prescription OIC medication with the convenience of once daily dosing, with only a tablet strength, and that can be taken with or without
food and with or without laxatives.
Because of the durable efficacy, tolerability and convenience benefits, we believe that Symproic is a best-in-class PAMORA that reliably provides
durable relief of OIC, which frees both the patient and the healthcare provider to focus on treating the patient’s chronic pain.
On April 4, 2019, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Shionogi to commercialize Symproic in the U.S. and Puerto Rico for the
treatment of OIC in adults with chronic non-cancer pain.

Table of Contents
Symproic is a strong complementary product to BELBUCA, as patients requiring a PAMORA are by definition taking an opioid. Therefore, our sales
force remains focused on high prescribers of long-acting opioids, BuTrans/buprenorphine transdermal and/or HCPs who prescribe short-acting opioids
around-the-clock for patients with chronic pain.
In 2021, we also focused on increasing market access for Symproic. As of January 2022, Symproic had formulary coverage for over 90% of
commercial lives. Approval rates within the commercial channel remained favorable throughout 2021 at about 82% and Medicare approval rates were
above 67%.
In 2021, Symproic had approximately 108 million lives across the country with preferred access. Symproic total prescriptions in 2021, according to
IQVIA NPA, totaled over 69,000, an increase of 2.5% over 2020. Symproic share of PAMORA prescriptions in 2021 totaled 12.5%.
ELYXYB (celecoxib oral solution) for acute treatment of migraine
In May, 2020 ELYXYB was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Compared to currently marketed
products and products under development, we believe that ELYXYB is differentiated based on the following features:
• selective inhibition of COX-2 stops inflammation and pain while preserving important functions of COX-1;
• self-microemulsifying drug delivery system enables increased solubility, dissolution rate and bioavailability of celecoxib;
• ready to use premixed solution in a single-dose bottle;
• reaches Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) in 42 minutes;
• delivers pain relief within 1 hour;
• delivers pain freedom within 2 hours;
• most patients reached freedom from photophobia, phonophobia and nausea at hours post-dose;
• lower use of rescue medication;
• low incidence of GI side effects in clinical trials; and
• no drowsiness reported in clinical trials.
Because of these unique features, we believe that ELYXYB will redefine the acute treatment of migraine pain, allowing patients to achieve the
migraine pain relief they desire.
On August 3, 2021 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited to acquire the U.S. and Canadian rights to
ELYXYB, the only FDA-approved ready-to-use oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults. ELYXYB represents an
excellent strategic fit for BDSI and a very attractive opportunity to diversify our product portfolio by expanding into the dynamic migraine market,
deepening our presence in Neurology, a logical adjacency to our pain franchise.
ONSOLIS (fentanyl buccal soluble film) for Breakthrough Cancer Pain
In July 2009, ONSOLIS was approved for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already
receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. ONSOLIS is indicated for the treatment of BTCP.
ONSOLIS provides significant reduction in pain for patients suffering from BTCP in a convenient formulation with a range of doses to allow patients to
titrate to an adequate level of pain control. We currently license ONSOLIS to TTY Biopharm Co., Ltd., or TTY, which markets the product as PAINKYL in
Taiwan, and to Mylan N.V., which markets the product as BREAKYL in Europe.
Additional Overview Information
From our inception through December 31, 2021, we have recorded accumulated losses totaling approximately $256.0 million. Our historical
operating losses have resulted principally from our prior research and development activities, including clinical trial activities for our products, sales, and
general and administrative expenses. Ultimately, if we secure additional approvals from the FDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world for
other products that we may acquire or in-license in the future, our goal will be to augment our current sources of revenue and, as applicable, with sales
of such products or royalties from such sales, on which we may pay royalties or other fees to our licensors and/or third-party collaborators as applicable.

Table of Contents
We intend to materially finance our commercialization and distribution efforts and our working capital needs primarily through:
• commercializing our approved products such as BELBUCA, Symproic and ELYXYB;
• partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to assist in the distribution and commercialization of our products, for which we could expect
to receive an upfront payment, milestones and/or royalty payments; and
• securing proceeds from public and private financings and other potential strategic transactions.
We have based our estimates of market size estimates, peak annual sales projections and similar matters described below and elsewhere in this
Report on our market research, third party reports and publicly available information which we consider reliable. However, readers are advised our
projected sales and similar metrics regarding BELBUCA, Symproic and ELYXYB are merely estimates and subject to many factors, many of which may be
beyond our control, which will likely cause us to revise such estimates. Readers are also advised that our projected sales figures do not consider the
royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our management’s reasonable
judgments given the information available and their previous experiences, although such estimates may not prove to be accurate.
Key Collaborative, Supply and Manufacturing Agreements
We are and have been a party to collaborative agreements with corporate partners, contractors, universities and government agencies. Our
collaboration arrangements are intended to provide us with access to greater resources and scientific expertise in addition to our in-house capabilities.
We also have supply arrangements with several of the key component producers of our delivery technology and we rely on third-party manufacturers
and packagers to produce commercial product. Our collaborative, supply and manufacturing agreements include:
• ARx. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with ARx to supply BELBUCA laminate (bulk product). This agreement
automatically renews for successive terms of one year each and currently covers minimum annual commitments for supply of bulk and finished
product through 2027.
• Sharp. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with Sharp which covers annual commitments for supply of packaged
BELBUCA finished product through 2022.
• Tapemark. Effective January 6, 2017, we assumed Endo’s agreement with The Tapemark Company, or Tapemark, to convert the BELBUCA
laminate (bulk product) into individual dosage units which were then transferred to Sharp for secondary packaging and supply of BELBUCA
finished product. Tapemark continued to provide such services for BELBUCA through 1st quarter of 2018 as we transitioned the converting and
primary packaging operations for BELBUCA over to an alternate packaging site in 2018. Tapemark remains qualified to conduct converting,
primary and finished goods packaging and release testing.
• Shionogi. Effective April 4, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Shionogi, Inc. pursuant to which Shionogi acts as a supplier of Symproic
finished product. Including the agreement extension via two consecutive 6-month periods, our supply agreement with Shionogi currently runs
until April 2022. In addition, we also entered into an agreement with UPM Pharmaceuticals (effective March 5, 2020 for a term of 5 years) and
with Cardinal Health Packaging Solutions (effective July 28, 2020 for a term of 2 years with 1-year renewable periods) for purposes of utilizing
their contract manufacturing and packaging services, respectively, for Symproic production.
• Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada. Effective September 9, 2021, we assumed Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited’s manufacturing and
supply agreement with Contract Pharmaceuticals Limited Canada to manufacture and supply ELYXYB finished product. The initial term of the
agreement runs until June 10, 2023. The agreement automatically renews for successive terms of two years each. The agreement covers annual
commitments for the supply of ELYXYB finished product.
Relationship with CDC IV, LLC
On July 14, 2005, we entered into a Clinical Development and License Agreement, or CDLA, with the predecessor of CDC IV, LLC, or CDC IV, which
provided funds to us for the development of ONSOLIS. Under the CDLA, as amended, we pay CDC IV a mid-single digit royalty, which shall not be less
than $375,000 per quarter, on sales of ONSOLIS. The CDLA royalty term ends upon the latter of expiration of the patent for ONSOLIS or generic entry into
any particular country, or the CDLA is terminated. We and CDC IV are also party to a Royalty Purchase and Amendment Agreement, or the RPAA,
pursuant to which we pay CDC IV a 1% royalty on sales of BELBUCA. The RPAA royalty term shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) such time at which
annual net sales of BUNAVAIL or BELBUCA equal less than $7.5 million in any calendar year following
9

Table of Contents
the third (3rd) anniversary of initial launch of the product and CDC IV receives $18,750 in three (3) consecutive quarters as payment for CDC IV’s 1%
royalty during such calendar year or (ii) upon the last commercial sale of BELBUCA anywhere in the world.
Licenses, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information
Our intellectual property strategy is intended to maximize protection of our proprietary technologies and know-how and to further expand targeted
opportunities by extension of our patents, trademarks, license agreements and trade secrets portfolio. In addition, an element of our strategic focus
provides for varying specific royalty or other payment obligations by our commercial partners as our applicable intellectual property portfolio changes or
business activity reaches certain thresholds.
However, patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical organizations are uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues. There is
considerable uncertainty regarding the breadth of claims in patent cases which results in varied degrees of protection. While we believe that our
intellectual property position is sound, it may be that our pending patent applications will not be granted or that our awarded claims may be too narrow
to protect the products against competitors. It is also possible that our intellectual property positions will be challenged or that patents issued to others
prior to our patent issuance may preclude us from commercializing our products. It is also possible that other parties could have or could obtain patent
rights which may cover or block our products or otherwise dominate our patent position.
BEMA Technology
The drug delivery technology space is congested, although we do not believe that our BEMA products conflict with, are dominated by, or infringe
any external patents and we do not believe that we require licenses under external patents for our BEMA based products in the U.S. It is possible,
however, that a court of law in the U.S. or elsewhere might determine otherwise. If a court were to determine that we were infringing other patents and
that those patents were valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our products or technologies and we may be unable
to obtain such licenses from the patent holders. If we were unable to obtain a license, or if the terms of the license were onerous, there may be a
material adverse effect upon our business plan to commercialize these products.
On March 1, 2011, we were granted a patent extending the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology in Canada to 2027. The Canadian
Patent No. 2,658,585 provides additional patent protection for ONSOLIS and BELBUCA. In April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No. 8,147,866, which
will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery technology for BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL in the U.S. from 2020 to 2027. In April 2014, the USPTO
granted US Patent No. 8,703,177 (issued from US Patent Application No. 13/590,094), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA drug delivery
technology for BUNAVAIL in the U.S. to at least 2032. In February 2018, we were granted US Patent No. 9,901,539, which will extend the exclusivity of
the BEMA technology for BELBUCA in the U.S. to December 21, 2032.
We own various patents and patent applications relating to the BEMA technology. US Patent No. 6,159,498 (expiration date October 2016), US
Patent No. 7,579,019 (expiration date January 22, 2020), US Patent No. 8,147,866 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 8,703,177 (expiration date
August 20, 2032), US Patent 9,522,188 (expiration date April 24, 2035), US Patent 9,597,288 (expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,655,843
(expiration date July 23, 2027), US Patent 9,901,539 (expiration date December 21, 2032), Canadian Patent No. 2,658,585 (expiration date July 2027),
EP2054031 (expiration date July 2027) and EP 0 973 497 (expiration date October 2017) are of particular value to our business and technology platform
relating to the BEMA delivery technology. On February 16, 2010, we filed a complaint with the United States Federal District Court for the District of
Columbia, requesting the USPTO be required to further extend the patent term for US 7,579,019 from 835 days to 1,191 days. In March 2011, we
prevailed in this case, and the patent expiration date of US Patent No. 7,579,019 was extended from January 31, 2019 to January 22, 2020.
On January 22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review, or IPR, on US Patent No. 7,579,019 with the USPTO. In the Petition, Aquestive
is requesting an inter partes review because it is asserting that the claims of US Patent No. 7,579,019 are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior
art references. The USPTO instituted the IPR on the US Patent No. 7,579,019 (which we refer to as the ’019 Patent). The USPTO found all claims
patentable and Aquestive filed a Request for Rehearing. On December 19, 2016, the PTAB issued a final decision denying Aquestive’s request for
rehearing. Aquestive did not appeal this final decision.
Medical Affairs Initiatives
Beginning in late 2018, we transitioned from a research and development-oriented organization into one that is more commercially focused. As
such, we expanded our medical affairs capabilities and honed our efforts toward maximizing our products in the market, particularly with BELBUCA and
ELYXYB. While we continue to modify our capabilities to best educate and support the medical and scientific community, some enhancements include:
10

Table of Contents
• strategically expanding our medical affairs department to include scientific communications, publications, and deeper medical expertise
regarding clinical and Health Economic and Outcomes Research (HEOR) initiatives;
• developing robust medical affairs plans for BELBUCA, Symproic and ELYXYB, in order to define future clinical studies, publications, congress
activities, and educational initiatives to deliver on the strategic imperatives in order to inform all stakeholders on the attributes of these products;
• proactively planning public policy initiatives and utilizing policy expertise in order to capitalize on federal and state tailwinds in chronic pain;
• continuing to progress post-marketing requirements (PMRs), for BELBUCA, Symproic, ELYXYB and BUNAVAIL; and
• providing regulatory, pharmacovigilance (PV), and drug safety support for BELBUCA, Symproic, ELYXYB, and ONSOLIS.
Our estimates of medical affairs initiatives, and our projected sales associated with each of our products discussed below and elsewhere in this
Report are merely estimates and subject to multiple factors, many of which are, or may be beyond our control, including those detailed in the Risk
Factors section of this Report. These factors and risks could cause delays, cost overruns or otherwise cause us to not achieve these estimates. Readers
are also advised that our projected sales figures do not consider the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic
partners. Our estimates are based upon our market research and management’s reasonable judgments, but readers are advised that such estimates
may prove to be inaccurate.
The following is a summary of our medical affair initiatives for our current products at December 31, 2021:
BELBUCA (buprenorphine buccal film). Following the transfer of BELBUCA to us in January 2017, we led clinical and Medical Affairs support behind
BELBUCA. We have assumed responsibility for the conduct of post approval commitments specified by FDA in the approval of BELBUCA, which include a
thorough QT (TQT) study and a pediatric study. In September 2013, the FDA announced that it will require all companies holding NDAs for extended-
release/long-acting, or ER/LA opioid analgesic drug products to conduct four post-marketing studies regarding risks associated with their long-term use
and one clinical trial to estimate risk of hyperalgesia. The FDA replaced the original requirements with new post-marketing requirements in February
2016. The Opioid PMR Consortium was formed with representatives from each of the member companies providing an opportunity for one set of studies
to be completed to satisfy the FDA requirements and distributing the associated costs across all member companies. Each member company pays an
equal share of the program costs and new members are required to pay equal share of the costs to date upon program entry and of future costs going
forward. We joined the Opioid PMR Consortium in October 2017 and our initial share of the program cost was paid in late 2017. To date, seven of eleven
studies have been completed and the program is expected to continue into 2022 and beyond. In addition, during the past year, we have completed all of
our publications planned from our Phase 1 study which compared the effects of therapeutic doses of BELBUCA and oxycodone hydrochloride on
respiratory drive in response to hypercapnia.
ELYXYB. Following the acquisition of ELYXYB in 2021, we have developed a robust medical affairs plan for 2022 and beyond. Included with this, we
have assumed responsibility for the conduct of a post approval commitment of a pediatric study which will begin in 2022.
SYMPROIC. We continue to advance an FDA PMR which is an observational study to access the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
naldemedine users.
BUNAVAIL. Activities in 2017 included work to support a label expansion of BUNAVAIL for the induction (conversion to buprenorphine) of opioid
dependent subjects, performance of FDA post-marketing study requirements and improvements in commercial manufacturing. In May 2017, we
announced that the FDA expanded the BUNAVAIL label to include induction of opioid dependent patients. We discontinued all marketing of BUNAVAIL in
June 2020, however the NDA remains active.
Government Regulation
The nonclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of any drug product is subject to significant regulation by governmental
authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time, expense and uncertainty.
In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing,
manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval
within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires several years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing
legislation by Congress and
11

Table of Contents
rulemaking by the FDA presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental
approval to market our products is granted.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation
strengthened the FDA’s authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a
particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA
determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with authority to
require a REMS at any point in a drug product’s lifecycle based on new safety information.
A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDA’s
assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the
seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse
events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a Medication Guide for distribution
when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include
provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special
certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use conditions;
and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS
provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain
injunctive relief against further distribution of the product.
On December 29, 2011, the FDA approved a “class-wide” REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk
management program. ONSOLIS is subject to this REMS, which includes a number of Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU).
Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering all opioid analgesic drug products. The class-wide REMS includes a REMS-compliant
educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA
is subject to this REMS.
A REMS is also in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL is included in this REMS, which includes a medication
guide and healthcare professional and patient education.
The cost and implementation of all of these “shared system” REMS is shared among multiple companies that are required to participate by way of
having an approved product that is subject to the particular REMS.
International Approval
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the
commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary
widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are
some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country currently has its own procedures and requirements.
ONSOLIS (under different trade names and with a slightly different formulation) is approved in Europe and in Taiwan. In 2019, after learning that
Purdue would no longer be marketing BELBUCA in Canada, BDSI requested that Purdue ask Health Canada to cancel its registration and approval there.
BDSI has no plans at the moment to market BELBUCA outside of the U.S.
Other Regulation
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to U.S. regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety
and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and
potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed
by state and federal regulations, the risk of injury cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages
that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risk
factors as well as all other information contained in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem
immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your
investment.
Risks Relating to the Pending Transaction with Collegium
We may not complete the pending transaction with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., or Collegium, within the time frame we
anticipate, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations.
On February 14, 2022, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to herein as the Merger Agreement, with Collegium and
Bristol Acquisition Company Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Collegium, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, on February 18, 2022, Merger Sub commenced a cash tender offer, or the tender offer, to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding shares of our common stock at a price per share of $5.60, in cash, subject to any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.
Following the consummation of the tender offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into our company, with our company surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Collegium, and each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than shares of common stock held by us or our direct or
indirect subsidiaries (including shares held in treasury), shares held by Collegium, Merger Sub or any of Collegium’s other direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries, shares validly tendered and irrevocably accepted for payment by Merger Sub in the tender offer and shares held by stockholders who are
entitled to demand, and who properly demand, appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $5.60 per share in cash,
without interest and subject to any required tax withholding.
The completion of the transaction will be conditioned on (1) at least one share more than 50% of all issued and outstanding shares having been
validly tendered into and not withdrawn from the tender offer, (2) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or any extension
thereof) applicable to the tender offer and the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, (3) the absence of any law or order that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prevents the consummation of the tender offer or the
merger, (4) the Merger Agreement not being terminated in accordance with its terms, (5) there not being, since the date of the Merger Agreement, a
13

Table of Contents
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (6) other customary closing conditions set forth in Annex I to the Merger Agreement. In
addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation
of our Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by us to enter into an agreement for a Superior Offer (as defined in the Merger
Agreement). As a result, we cannot assure you that the transaction with Collegium will be completed, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms
set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.
If the transaction is not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our
common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed. We could be
required to pay Collegium a termination fee of approximately $18.1 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances
described in the Merger Agreement. The failure to complete the transaction also may result in negative publicity and negatively affect our relationship
with our stockholders, employees, collaborators, customers, vendors, regulators and other third parties. We may also be required to devote significant
time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to
perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.
The announcement and pendency of the transaction with Collegium could adversely affect our business, financial results and/or
operations.
Our efforts to complete the transaction could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may
materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the transaction will be completed may affect our ability
to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the transaction
is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the transaction. A substantial amount of our management’s and
employees’ attention is being directed toward the completion of the transaction and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty
as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with collaborators, vendors, customers, regulators and other business partners.
For example, vendors, collaborators and other counterparties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business
relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition,
as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the transaction could be exacerbated by any delays in
completion of the transaction or termination of the Merger Agreement.
While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.
While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, generally requiring us to conduct our business in
the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent Collegium’s prior consent. These
limitations include, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter
into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, hire or terminate employees (other than for cause), pay dividends, make capital expenditures, take
certain actions relating to intellectual property, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could prevent us from
pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively
and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.
In certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Collegium, which could require us to use
available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Collegium a termination fee of approximately $18.1 million if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under such
circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have
otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could
materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our
common stock.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the pending transaction with Collegium.
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in
connection with the pending transaction. We must pay substantially all of these costs and expenses whether or not the transaction is completed. There
are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses.

Risks Relating to Our Business
We have incurred significant losses since inception and as such, you cannot rely upon our historical operating performance to make
an investment decision regarding our company.
From our inception in January 1997 and through December 31, 2019, we recorded significant losses. Beginning in fiscal year ended 2020 we
recorded net income. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded net income of $84.9 million and our accumulated deficit at December 31,
2021 was approximately $256.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $119.7 million. Our ability to generate
revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to effectively market and sell our products, secure and maintain payer
access and manufacture our products to meet demand. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals consistently and there is no guarantee
that we will continue to generate revenue in the future.
We have generated licensing-related revenue for ONSOLIS outside the US, and we have generated revenue from the commercial sales of our
approved products, BELBUCA, in addition to generating revenue from the commercial sales of Symproic. In the case of BELBUCA, our approval initially
generated milestone revenue from our prior commercial partner Endo. However, in January 2017, we re-acquired the commercialization rights for
BELBUCA and are utilizing our internal sales force to sell our product. In the case of Symproic, we acquired rights to the product in April 2019, and
commenced the commercial launch of the product using our own sales force shortly thereafter. We have also historically generated revenue from the
commercial sale of BUNAVAIL however, in June 2020, we subsequently discontinued marketing for BUNAVAIL and do not expect to generate revenue from
sales of BUNAVAIL in the future. In the case of ONSOLIS, as of the date of this report, we do not have any plans to launch ONSOLIS in the U.S.
If our competitors are successful in obtaining approval for Abbreviated New Drug Applications for products that have the same
active ingredients as BELBUCA, Symproic or ELYXYB, sales of BELBUCA, Symproic or ELYXYB may be adversely affected.
Our competitors may submit for approval certain Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, which provide for the marketing of a drug product
that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as a drug product already listed with the FDA, and which has been shown to
be bioequivalent to such FDA-listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic versions of a listed drug and can often be
substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for an original listed drug. Any applicant filing an ANDA is required to make patent certifications to
the FDA, such as certification to the FDA that the new product that is subject to the ANDA will not infringe an already approved product’s listed patents or
that such patents are invalid (otherwise known as a Paragraph IV Certification).
In the past, we have initiated litigation with generic competitors that have filed Paragraph IV Certifications challenging certain of our patents. While
we have entered in to settlement agreements with certain competitors, we are still pursuing litigation to defend against Patent IV Certifications related to
BELBUCA. For more information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV of this
Report on Form 10-K. We believe that we will continue to be subject to ANDA-related litigation, which is costly and distracting and has the potential to
impair the long-term value of our products.
We may need to raise additional funding to fund certain strategic initiatives. Depending on the nature of those initiatives, if we fail
to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to pursue certain initiatives.
We expect to spend substantial amounts of our financial resources on our commercialization efforts going forward. Our business currently generates
revenue from product sales, and such current sources of revenue may not be sufficient to meet potential capital requirements to support such strategic
priorities. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are unavailable, we may be
required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more potential strategic opportunities.
Our long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks.
Our long-term capital requirements are expected to depend on many factors, including, among others:
• costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products
• costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing (through litigation or other means) our patents, trademarks and other
intellectual property;
• costs involved in expanding manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our products;
• costs we may incur in acquiring new technologies or products;
• competing technological and market developments;
15

Table of Contents
• market acceptance of our products;
• costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants; and
• legal, accounting, insurance and other professional and business-related costs.
We may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated.
We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other
sources, which may have a material effect on our current or future business prospects.
Our term loan agreement with Pharmakon contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be
required to make a prepayment or repay the outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect under our loan agreement if a
prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a materially
adverse effect on our business.
Our agreement with Pharmakon contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit
our ability to, among other things:
• incur additional indebtedness;
• enter into a merger, consolidation or certain changing of control events without complying with the terms of the loan agreement;
• change the nature of our business;
• change our organizational structure or type;
• amend, modify or waive any of our material agreements or organizational documents;
• grant certain types of liens on our assets;
• make certain investments;
• pay cash dividends; and
• enter into material transactions with affiliates.
The restrictive covenants of the term loan agreement could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that we or our stockholders may
consider beneficial. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the term loan agreement. An event of default will also
occur if, among other things, a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition occurs, or a material impairment of the prospect of our
repayment of any portion of the amounts we owe under the term loan agreement occurs. In the case of a continuing event of default under the
agreement, Pharmakon could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend
further credit, proceed against the collateral in which we granted Pharmakon a security interest under the term loan agreement and related agreements,
or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement are secured by all of our existing and future
assets (excluding certain intellectual property).
We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds on satisfactory terms, if at all, through equity or debt financings to
make any required prepayment or repay such indebtedness at the time any such prepayment event or event of default occurs. In such an event, we may
be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to market our products that we would otherwise
prefer to develop and market ourselves. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result.
Social issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement and other legal concerns over diversion of opioids and
regulatory efforts to combat abuse, misuse and addiction, could impact the potential market for BELBUCA.
Opioid abuse in the U.S. is a significant healthcare issue, and the active ingredient in BELBUCA is an opioid. Media reports regarding prescription
drug abuse and the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies have and will likely
continue to apply policies and guidelines that seek to limit the availability or use of opioids. In addition, federal, state and local governments have and
may enact legislation or executive orders with similar goals. State and local governments have also taken legal action against opioid manufacturers to
recoup alleged damages arising out of the abuse and misuse of opioids. Such efforts have challenged and could inhibit our ability to successfully market
BELBUCA.
Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other opioid drugs; the limitations of
abuse-resistant formulations; the ability of drug abusers to discover previously unknown ways to abuse opioid drugs; public inquiries and investigations
into prescription drug abuse; litigation; or regulatory activity
16

Table of Contents
regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioid drugs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, there may be
continued reluctance of some regulators and third-party payers to pay a premium for abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids or opioids such as BELBUCA
with less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids. These factors could reduce the potential size of the market for BELBUCA and
decrease the revenues we are able to generate from its sale.
Efforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat abuse of opioids may negatively impact the market for BELBUCA. For example, in
February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA’s approach to opioid medications. The plan
identifies FDA’s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set
forth in the FDA’s plan include strengthening post marketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS
requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic-abuse
deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA’s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The
FDA’s Scientific Advisory Board met to address these issues on March 1, 2016. The FDA’s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the HHS to address
opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative’s focus is on improving physician’s use of opioids through education and resources to
address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both
prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling
and behavioral therapies with medication to address substance abuse. Also, as part of this initiative, the CDC has launched a state grant program to offer
state health departments resources to assist with abuse prevention efforts, including efforts to track opioid prescribing through state-run electronic
databases. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is
intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve
communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of
pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. The guideline does not specifically address the use of buprenorphine for
chronic pain or make treatment recommendations about the use of abuse-deterrent opioids.
In June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the
benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This was the first time the agency took steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain
medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDA’s decision was based on a review of all available post-marketing data,
which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation.
In September 2017, the CDC removed the MME conversion factors for buprenorphine from its online oral MME data file. And, in 2018, it included a
statement in the MME data file noting “Buprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner
as doses for full agonist opioids.”
In May 2019, the Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force issued their Final Report on Pain
Management Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, Inconsistencies, and Recommendations. The report identified that one of the barriers in pain management
best practices “includes lack of coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine as well as the lack of education and training on the proper usage of
buprenorphine. There has been a lack of access to buprenorphine treatment for chronic pain.” The report then makes recommendations that third-party
payers should provide coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine treatment approaches. The report also encouraged the primary use of
buprenorphine when opioids are appropriate for chronic pain. In October 2019, the HHS issued a guide for clinicians on how to appropriately reduce the
dose for patients on long-term opioids. Within this guidance, it was noted that if patients on high opioid dosages are unable to taper despite worsening
pain and/or function with opioids, clinicians should consider transitioning the patient to buprenorphine. The guide also noted that in addition to treating
pain, buprenorphine has other properties that may be helpful, including less opioid-induced hyperalgesia and easier withdrawal than full mu-agonist
opioids, and less respiratory depression than other long-acting opioids.
In addition, at least 49 U.S. states and many cities and counties have filed civil suits or instituted other proceedings against opioid manufacturers
and wholesalers of opioid drugs seeking damages under various claims for contributing to the opioid crisis. Such litigations could further damage the
market for opioid products like BELBUCA. To the extent our company is named in such lawsuits, we could be required to participate in the settlement of
such litigations or the payment of damages, which could divert our management’s attention from our business, deplete our financial resources, and
damage our reputation.
Government agencies may establish and promulgate usage guidelines that could limit the use of our products and drug candidates.
National and state level government agencies, professional and medical societies, and other groups may establish usage guidelines that apply to
our products and drug candidates. These guidelines could address such matters as usage and dose,
17

Table of Contents
among other factors. Application of such guidelines could limit the clinical use or commercial appeal of our products or drug candidates.
As such, in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted a soft edit of 90 MME per day for patients, aligning with the 2016 CDC
Guideline recommendation. A medication soft edit can be used to alert the pharmacist to a potential safety risk for the patient, but can often be
overridden after consulting with the prescriber.
If we are unable to convince physicians as to the benefits of our products, we may incur delays or additional expense in our
attempt to establish market acceptance.
Use of our products will require physicians to be informed regarding the intended benefits of our products. The time and cost of such an educational
process may be substantial. Inability to carry out this physician education process may adversely affect market acceptance of our proposed formulations
or products. We may be unable to timely educate physicians regarding our intended pharmaceutical formulations or products in sufficient numbers to
achieve our marketing plans or to achieve product acceptance. Any delay in physician education may materially delay or reduce demand for our
formulations or products. Nonetheless, even with our best efforts, certain physicians may never prescribe our product.
We have been and expect to be significantly dependent on our collaboration agreements for the manufacturing of our products,
which expose us to the risk of reliance on the performance of third parties.
In conducting our operations, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on numerous collaborative agreements with third parties such as
manufacturers, commercial partners, governmental agencies and not-for-profit organizations for both strategic and financial resources.
The termination of these relationships, or failure to perform by us or our partners (who are subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks) under
their applicable agreements or arrangements with us, or our failure to secure additional agreements for our products, would substantially disrupt or delay
our development activities. Any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of
operation.
We depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time.
Our ability to achieve our corporate objectives will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management, particularly our
senior executive officers. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the
services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to loss of sales and
diversion of management resources. In addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified
personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a
timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our commercialization programs. Additionally, we do not currently maintain “key person” life
insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss
of the services of these individuals.
We may be unable to manage our growth effectively.
Our business strategy involves growth and expansion as we continue our evolution as a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company. As we
in-license or acquire additional product candidates, we will likely have to expand existing operations to increase our contract manufacturing capabilities,
hire and train new personnel to handle the marketing and sales of our products and assist patients in obtaining reimbursement for the use of our
products. We may also need to grow to support our commercial activities for BELBUCA, Symproic and the recent launch of ELYXYB. This growth may
place significant strain on our management, financial and operational resources. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement
appropriate financial and management controls, systems and procedures. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our success in attracting
and retaining highly qualified personnel, for which the competition may be intense. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, our business could
be harmed.
We are exposed to product liability and, non-clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should
lawsuits be filed against us.
Our business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of
pharmaceutical formulations and products. It is possible that such claims could be asserted against us at some point. A successful liability claim or series
of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We currently have a general liability/product liability policy which includes coverage for our commercially marketed products. Annual aggregate
limits include $2 million for general liability, with $1 million for each occurrence, with umbrella
18

Table of Contents
liability in the amount of an additional $5 million aggregate and $5 million per occurrence; product liability is $10 million for aggregate and $10 million
per occurrence. It is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims. Under our agreements, our partners are required to
carry comprehensive general product liability and tort liability insurance, each in amounts not less than $2 million per incident and $2 million annual
aggregate and to name us as an additional insured thereon. However, we or our commercial partners may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate
product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential
liabilities. Furthermore, our current and potential partners with whom we have collaborative agreements, or our future licensees may not be willing to
indemnify us against these types of liabilities and may not themselves be sufficiently insured or have sufficient assets to satisfy any product liability
claims. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that may be obtained by us or our partners could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, product liability insurance is costly, and due to the nature of the pharmaceutical products underlying BELBUCA, Symproic, ONSOLIS and
ELYXYB, we or our partners may not be able to obtain such insurance, or, if obtained, we or our partners may not be able to maintain such insurance on
economically feasible terms. If a product related action is brought against us, or liability is found against us prior to our obtaining product liability
insurance for any product, or should we have liability found against us for any other matter in excess of any insurance coverage we may carry, we could
face significant difficulty continuing operations.
We are presently a party to lawsuits by third parties who claim that our products, methods of manufacture or methods of use
infringe on their intellectual property rights, and we may be exposed to these types of claims in the future.
We are presently, and may continue to be, exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our technologies, processes, formulations,
methods, or products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. This risk is
exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in pharmaceutical patents is, in most instances, uncertain and highly complex.
Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, would result in substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial and human
resources and could harm our reputation. Such a situation may force us to do one or more of the following:
• incur significant costs in legal expenses for defending against an intellectual property infringement suit;
• cease selling, making, importing, incorporating or using one or more or all of our technologies and/or formulations or products that incorporate
the challenged intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;
• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable
terms, if at all; or
• redesign our formulations or products, which would be costly and time-consuming.
With respect to our BEMA delivery technology, the thin film drug delivery technology space is highly competitive. There is a risk that a court of law
in the U.S. or elsewhere could determine that one or more of our BEMA based products conflicts with or covered by external patents. This risk presently
exists in our litigation with Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as MonoSol Rx LLC, or Aquestive) relating to our BELBUCA product which was
filed in January 2017. If the courts in these cases were to rule against us and our partner in these cases, we could be forced to license technology from
Aquestive or be prevented from marketing BELBUCA, or otherwise incur liability for damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability
for us or our partners to market and sell BELBUCA.
We have been granted non-exclusive license rights to European Patent No. 949 925, which is controlled by LTS to market BELBUCA and ONSOLIS
within the countries of the European Union. We are required to pay a low single digit royalty on sales of products that are covered by this patent in the
European Union. We have not conducted freedom to operate searches and analyses for our other proposed products. Moreover, the possibility exists that
a patent could issue that would cover one or more of our products, requiring us to defend a patent infringement suit or necessitating a patent validity
challenge that would be costly, time consuming and possibly unsuccessful.
Our lawsuits with Aquestive and Indivior have caused us to incur significant legal costs to defend ourselves, and we would be subject to similar costs
if we are a party to similar lawsuits in the future Furthermore, if a court were to determine that we infringe any other patents and that such patents are
valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our BEMA products. We may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent
holders, which could materially and adversely impact our business.
If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or secure rights to third-party patents, we may
lose valuable rights, experience reduced market share, assuming there is any market share, or incur costly litigation to, enforce,
maintain or protect such rights.

Our ability to license, enforce and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others
will be important to our commercializing any formulations or products under development. The current and future development of our drug delivery
technologies is contingent upon whether we are able to maintain licenses and access patented technologies. Without these licenses, the use of
technologies would be limited and the sales of our products could be prohibited. Therefore, any disruption in access to the technologies could
substantially delay the development and sale of our products.
The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, which involve licensing agreements, are frequently uncertain
and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent
is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and licensed rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held
invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop drug delivery technologies or products similar to ours or
design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law.
We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We
require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us.
These agreements provide that materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s
relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and assign the ownership of relevant
inventions created during the course of employment to us. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate
remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information and techniques, reverse engineer, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our
rights in trade secrets, technical know-how and other non-patented technology.
In addition, we may have to resort to costly and time consuming litigation to protect or enforce our rights under certain intellectual property, or to
determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending our rights could be expensive, could cause significant diversion of our resources
and may not prove successful. Any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technologies
to develop or sell competing products.
We are dependent on third party suppliers for key components of our delivery technologies and products.
We rely on certain materials used in our development and third-party manufacturing processes, most of which are procured from five contract
manufacturers and three active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) suppliers for BELBUCA and Symproic. We purchase our pharmaceutical ingredients
pursuant to long-term supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers. The failure of a supplier, including a subcontractor, to deliver on schedule
could delay or interrupt the development or commercialization process and thereby adversely affect our operating results. In addition, a disruption in the
commercial supply of or a significant increase in the cost of the API from any of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our BELBUCA and
Symproic business, which would affect our financial position and results of operations.
In 2020, we utilized only one contract manufacturer to create the BELBUCA laminates and an additional two contract manufacturer to package the
laminates into final product. We utilize two contract manufacturers to create the Symproic tablets and only one contract manufacturer to package the
tablets into final product. We have made significant progress during 2021 in developing additional secondary suppliers for all products. Although we have
long term supply agreements with these vendors, any problems or regulatory issues at any of these vendors could create significant BELBUCA and
Symproic supply delays. The reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in:
• delays associated with development and non-clinical and clinical trials due to an inability to timely obtain a single or limited source
component;
• inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of API and an adequate supply of required components; and
• reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery.
Our relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers are particularly important to us and any loss of or material diminution of their capabilities
due to factors such as regulatory issues, accidents, acts of God, extreme weather events, pandemics, labor issues and strikes, or any other factor beyond
our reasonable control would have a material adverse effect on our company. Any loss of or interruption in the supply of components from our suppliers
or other third-party suppliers would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or require us to manufacture these components internally, which we
are currently not able to do.
If the supply of any components is lost or interrupted, API, product or components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient
quality or in volumes within required time frames, if at all, to meet our or our partners’ needs. This
20

Table of Contents
could delay our ability to complete clinical trials, obtain approval for commercialization or commence marketing or cause us to lose sales, force us into
breach of other agreements, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or harm our reputation. Furthermore, product or components from a
new supplier may not be identical to those provided by the original supplier. Such differences could have material effects on our overall business plan
and timing, could fall outside of regulatory requirements, affect product formulations or the safety and effectiveness of our products that are being
developed.
There are risks associated with our reliance on third parties for managed care, distribution infrastructure and channels.
We have entered into agreements with commercial partners to engage in marketing and distribution efforts around our products. We may be unable
to establish or maintain third-party relationships on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, these third parties may have similar or more
established relationships with our competitors.
We may be unable to continue to engage qualified distributors. Even if engaged, these distributors may:
• fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us;
• fail to adequately market our formulations or products;
• cease operations with little or no notice to us; or
• offer, design, manufacture or promote competing formulations or products.
If we fail to develop sales, managed care, marketing and distribution channels, we would experience delays in generating sales and incur increased
costs, which would harm our expected financial results.
The class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for all transmucosal fentanyl products, and similar programs for
other narcotic products, may slow sales and marketing efforts for products that contain narcotics, which could impact our royalty and
sales revenue from such products.
Our approved product ONSOLIS is formulated with the potent narcotic fentanyl. On December 29, 2011, FDA approved a REMS program covering all
transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was
designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment,
to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all approved transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program and was implemented in
March 2012. Additionally, the FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid class. The class-wide REMS
program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling
materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA falls within the existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and
long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category.
Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.
Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors, and
consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and
telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents, or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in
a material disruption of our commercialization activities, and our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of
resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and
significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or
damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the
commercialization of any product could be delayed.
Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek
changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.
Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and how our company is governed or may seek to acquire control over
our company. Some investors (commonly known as “activist investors”) seek to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions
such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Activist
campaigns can also seek to change the composition of our board of directors, and campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can
disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the
21

Table of Contents
pursuit of our business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction that can arise from potential changes to the composition
of our board of directors sought by activists may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which
may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities
and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could divert our management’s
attention from our business or cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors
that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
company.
COVID-19 may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our operations, including our efforts to market BELBUCA and Symproic. Any decrease in sales or
interruption in supply of any of our products could increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.
In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including
quarantines, travel restrictions, social distancing and business shutdowns. We have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize
the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all home-office employees to work remotely. We have suspended non-essential
travel worldwide for our employees and are discouraging employee attendance at other gatherings. These measures could negatively affect our
business, although to date that has not been the case. For instance, temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely may induce absenteeism,
disrupt our operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. COVID-19 has also caused volatility in the global financial markets and threatened
a slowdown in the global economy, which may negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms or at all.
The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19,
including vaccination programs, particularly in the geographies where we or our third party suppliers and contract manufacturers or contract research
organizations operate. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct
our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse
impact on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Regulation
Our failure to obtain government approvals or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations relating to our technologies could
delay or limit introduction of any proposed formulations and products and result in failure to achieve revenues or maintain our ongoing
business.
The manufacture and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous government
authorities in the U.S. and abroad. Before receiving FDA or foreign regulatory clearance to market our proposed formulations and products, we will have
to demonstrate that our formulations and products are safe and effective in the patient population and for the diseases that are to be treated. Clinical
trials, manufacturing and marketing of drugs are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory
authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing,
manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices. As a result, regulatory approvals can take a number of years
or longer to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial financial, managerial and other resources.
If users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is
adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.
The continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain
or reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers,
suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription
pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of
healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on
the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the
announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of
operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the Patient
22

Table of Contents
Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty relating to the scope of
government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products.
The ability of our company to commercialize BELBUCA, Symproic, ELYXYB, or any partners with which we have a licensing arrangement to sell
ONSOLIS, will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our proposed formulations and products and related
treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers
are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and medical services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., which could
control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce
government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our drugs.
Our business involves environmental risks related to handling regulated substances which could severely affect our ability to
develop our drug delivery technology.
In connection with the manufacture of materials and products, we and our partners are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations
and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological
specimens and wastes. We and our partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in
the future. The activities of our manufacturing and commercial partners, both now and in the future, may involve the controlled use of hazardous
materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals and narcotics. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or
injury from these materials. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed
our resources.
Government and other efforts to reform the healthcare industry could have adverse effects on our company, including the inability
of users of our current and future approved products to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, which could lead to
diminished market acceptance of, and revenues from, such products.
Our ability to commercialize BELBUCA, Symproic, and ELYXYB alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and
reimbursement for the product will be available from:
• government and health administration authorities;
• private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and
• other healthcare payers.
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in
the U.S. or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or
policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products may lose any regulatory approval that may have been
obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, we cannot predict what actions the Biden administration will implement in connection with the Affordable Care Act. However, it is
possible that such initiatives could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize products in the United States in the future. For
example, any changes that reduce, or impede the ability to obtain, reimbursement for the type of products we intend to commercialize in the United
States or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business plan to introduce our products in the United States.
In addition, we are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013, or the DSCSA. The U.S. government has enacted DSCSA which
requires development of an electronic product tracking and tracing of each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system,
which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic requirements may increase
our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.
It remains to be seen whether these orders and resulting regulations will remain in force during the Biden Administration.
We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement. Our failure to comply with those laws could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.
We may also be subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in
which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
23

Table of Contents
• the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy
of protected health information;
• the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the
purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the
Medicare and Medicaid programs;
• federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
• federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to
healthcare matters; and
• state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services
reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be
subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from
participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our
financial results.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock
Our stock price is subject to market factors and market volatility, both generally and with respect to our industry and our company
specifically. As such, there is a risk that your investment in our common stock could fluctuate in value.
The overall market for securities in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market
prices of many smaller companies. In particular, the market prices of securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have been extremely
volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These
broad market fluctuations (as well as market reactions to particular developments with our company) have and could continue to result in extreme
fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. These fluctuations, as well as general
economic and market conditions, may have a material and/or adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
Additional authorized shares of our common stock and preferred stock available for issuance may adversely affect the market for
our common stock.
As of March 7, 2022, there are 106,494,480 shares of common stock issued and 103,228,796 shares of common stock outstanding.
On July 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock, par value $0.001, of our common stock from 175,000,000 to 225,000,000 shares. This increase in our authorized shares of common stock
provides us with the flexibility to issue more shares in the future, which might cause dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the total number of shares
of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. To the
extent such options (including options under our stock incentive plan) or warrants are exercised, the holders of our common stock may experience
further dilution.
Additionally, we have an effective shelf registration which registered up to $125 million of our securities for potential future issuance. To the extent
we issue such shares of stock under this registration statement, the current holders of our common stock may experience further dilution.
Anti-takeover provisions under our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control, which
could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
current management.
Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of
preserving our current management, such as:
• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;
24

Table of Contents
• limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;
• permitting stockholder action by written consent;
• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by
stockholders at stockholder meetings;
• requiring a super-majority vote of our stockholders to remove directors of our company; and
• providing that our stockholders may only remove our directors for “cause” (as defined in our bylaws).
These provisions affect your rights as a stockholder since they permit our board of directors to make it more difficult for common stockholders to
replace members of the board or undertake other significant corporate actions. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members
of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace our current management team.
Our bylaws designate specific courts in as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company’s
stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.
Pursuant to our bylaws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the
sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant
to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or
determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or (5) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the
“Delaware Forum Provision”). The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of
the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the
“Federal Forum Provision”). In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision;
provided, however, that stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder.
The Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any
such claims. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for
disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees,
even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal
forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there
is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may
incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders
who assert that the provision is not enforceable or invalid. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United
States may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located
or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.
The financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.
The projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to potential peak sales amounts,
production and supply dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions
with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections
themselves, will prove inaccurate. There may be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from
those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in (or incorporated by reference in) this Report should not be regarded as an
indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the
projections should not be relied upon as such.

We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay
any dividends for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the merger agreement with Collegium generally restricts our ability to pay any dividends on our
common stock during the interim period between the execution of the merger agreement and the completion of the transaction (or the date on which the
merger agreement is earlier terminated). Therefore, you should not invest in our common stock with the expectation that you will receive dividends.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. When we
cross-reference to a “Note,” we are referring to our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” unless the context indicates otherwise. This discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those which are not within our control.
Our Strategy
Our growth strategy continues to evolve from our capable and successful commercial organization. We seek to further build a well-balanced,
diversified, high-growth specialty pharmaceuticals company focused on delivering innovative therapies for patients living with serious and debilitating
diseases. Through our industry-leading commercialization infrastructure, we continue to deliver strong growth of our existing portfolio and also possess
the skills to launch new product initiatives. As part of our corporate growth strategy, we have licensed and acquired products and will pursue additional
product opportunities in therapeutic areas that meet the needs of our patients. With focused attention on patient access and a structured business-
development process for transformative acquisitions or licensing opportunities, we will fully leverage our experience and apply it toward developing new
partnerships that enable us to commercialize novel products that can improve the lives of people suffering from challenging medical conditions.
We will continue to drive value from our product portfolio with a strong emphasis on BELBUCA growth, including further adoption in the large long-
acting opioid market. The product uses our proprietary BEMA technology and maintains a unique delivery profile, strong payer access position and
growing physician interest. Symproic continues to climb in both prescriptions and prescribers, proving to be a valuable complementary product for our
called upon universe of BELBUCA targets. Our latest portfolio addition, ELYXYB, will furthermore benefit from our sales and marketing expertise and will
provide a building foundation in the neurology specialty to fuel future growth opportunities for the business.
Recent Highlights
• On August 4, 2021, we announced that we entered into an agreement on August 3, 2021 with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited (which closed
September 9, 2021) to acquire the U.S. and Canadian rights to ELYXYB, the only FDA-approved ready-to-use oral solution for the acute
treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults.
• On October 21, 2021, we announced the appointment of John Golubieski as Chief Accounting Officer, effective October 25, 2021, and Chief
Financial Officer, effective November 4, 2021. Mr. Golubieski brings to BDSI more than 30 years of financial and operational experience and will
serve as a member of our company's executive leadership team.
• On December 20, 2021, we announced that the U.S. District Court of Delaware issued an opinion in favor of BDSI in our patent litigation against
Alvogen Group, Inc. and its affiliates, who filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for our BELBUCA product on May 23, 2018.
• On February 14, 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., and Bristol
Acquisition Company Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Collegium. Refer to Note 15 "Subsequent Events" of our
consolidated financial statements for more information related to the merger.
• On February 24, 2022, we announced the U.S. commercial launch and availability of ELYXYB.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We review all significant estimates affecting the consolidated
financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance. Significant estimates include:
revenue recognition associated with sales allowances such as government program rebates, customer voucher redemptions, commercial contracts,
rebates and chargebacks; sales returns reserves; sales bonuses; stock-based compensation; and deferred income taxes.

Impairment Testing
In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level annually,
or more frequently if indicated by events or conditions. We performed an evaluation and determined that there is only one reporting unit. In performing a
goodwill impairment test, GAAP allows for either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment to be performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that
no impairment exists, then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether impairment has occurred, a
quantitative evaluation is performed. The quantitative impairment test first identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting
unit with its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded based on that difference. The determination of
goodwill impairment is highly subjective. It considers many factors both internal and external and is subject to significant changes from period to period.
No goodwill impairment charges have resulted from this analysis for 2021, 2020 or 2019.
An impairment of a long-lived asset other than goodwill is recognized under GAAP if the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets of which
it is a part) exceeds (i) the future estimated undiscounted cash flow from the use of the asset (or group of assets) and (ii) the fair value of the asset (or
asset group). In making this impairment assessment, we predominately use an undiscounted cash flow model derived from internal forecasts. Factors
that could change the result of our impairment test include, but are not limited to, different assumptions used to forecast future net sales, expenses,
capital expenditures, and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models. If our management determines that the value of intangible assets
have become impaired using this approach, we will record an accounting charge for the impairment. No impairment charges have been recorded for
other amortizing intangibles in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Inventory Valuation
We provide inventory write-downs determined primarily by the accumulated cost to manufacture our inventory, which is impacted by component
costs and manufacturing yields. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value and charged to
cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and
circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
We provide a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories identified by a lot-by-lot analysis of our finished goods inventory which considers the
expiration dates and future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory on-hand and the
expected demand of the inventory. At the point of the loss recognition, a charge to cost of sales is recorded and a reserve is established for that
inventory. The inventory reserve is relieved upon the future sale or disposal of that inventory.
Stock-Based Compensation and other Stock-Based Valuation Issues
We account for stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using fair value-based method to determine compensation for all
arrangements where shares of stock or equity instruments are issued for compensation. Fair values of equity securities issued are determined by
management based predominantly on the trading price of our common stock. The values of these awards are based upon their grant-date fair value.
That cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option and warrant grants. Refer to Note 1, “Nature of business
and summary of significant accounting policies” for more information related to assumptions in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We measure the fair value of instruments in accordance with GAAP which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. GAAP also establishes a
fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. We consider the carrying amount of our cash and cash equivalents to approximate fair value due to short-term nature of this instrument.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
30

Table of Contents
Under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” we are required to evaluate the impact of
estimating variable consideration related to our product sales and licensing contracts. We use the expected value method to estimate the total revenue
of the contract, constrained by the probability that there would not be a significant revenue reversal in a future period. We evaluate the expected value
of revenue over the term of the contract and adjust revenue recognition as appropriate.
Refer to Note 1, “Nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies” for more information related to, (i) product sales, (ii)
performance obligations, (iii) adjustments to product sales and (iv) gross to net accruals.
License and development agreements
We periodically enter into license and development agreements to develop and commercialize our products. The arrangements typically are multi-
deliverable arrangements that are funded through upfront payments, milestone payments and other forms of payment. Depending on the nature of the
contract these revenues are classified as research and development reimbursements or contract revenue.
Product Royalty Revenues
Product royalty revenue amounts are based on sales revenue of the PAINKYL product under the Company’s license agreement with TTY and the
BREAKYL product under the Company’s license agreement with Mylan.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in 2021 includes direct costs attributable to the production of BELBUCA, Symproic, BREAKYL and PAINKYL. Cost of sales also includes
royalty expenses owed to third parties. Cost of sales in 2020 and 2019 also included BUNAVAIL.
For BELBUCA, Symproic and formerly BUNAVAIL, cost of sales includes raw materials, production costs at our contract manufacturing sites, quality
testing directly related to the product, lower of cost of market, and depreciation on equipment that we have purchased to produce BELBUCA, Symproic
and BUNAVAIL. It also includes any batches not meeting specifications, raw material yield loss and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. Cost of
sales for BELBUCA, Symproic and BUNAVAIL are recognized when sold to the wholesaler from our distribution center. There were no deferred cost of
sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 nor 2020. Yield losses and batches not meeting specifications are expensed as incurred. For the year
ended December 31,2019, depreciation expense included accelerated depreciation for BUNAVAIL specific equipment due to the discontinuation of
marketing BUNAVAIL in June 2020.
For BREAKYL and PAINKYL, we do not take ownership of the subject product as we do not have inventory. Accordingly, raw material product is
transferred to Mylan, in the case of BREAKYL and TTY in the case of PAINKYL, immediately in accordance with the terms of our contractual arrangements
with Mylan and TTY. LTS manufactures both products for us. Mylan’s and TTY’s royalty payments to us include an amount related to cost of
sales. Ownership and title to the product, including insurance risk, belong to LTS through completion and inventory of the subject product, and then to
Mylan and TTY upon shipment of such subject product. This is in accordance with our contracts with LTS and Mylan and TTY, which identify the subject
product as FOB manufacturer.
Income taxes
Refer to Note 10, “Income taxes” for more information related to (i) the impact of the Tax Act to our Company, (ii) reconciliation of the Federal
statutory income tax rate to the effective rate, (iii) the tax effects of temporary differences and net operating losses that give rise to significant
components of deferred tax assets and liabilities and (iv) our federal and state net operating loss carry forward (“NOLs”).
Results of Operations
For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Product Sales. We recognized $164.6 million and $154.6 million in product sales during the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively, from our
products BELBUCA, Symproic and minimally from BUNAVAIL in 2020. The increase in 2021 is principally due to growth of BELBUCA sales, offset by the
discontinuation of BUNAVAIL in 2020.
Product Royalty Revenues. We recognized $2.1 million and $1.9 million in product royalty revenue during the years ended 2021 and 2020,
respectively, which are composed of BREAKYL sales from Mylan and PAINKYL sales from TTY.

Table of Contents
Cost of Sales. We incurred $23.4 million and $24.7 million in cost of sales during the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cost of sales
includes product cost, royalties paid, and yield adjustments. The decrease in cost of sales in 2021 is driven by a credit received from our contract
manufacturer in 2021 of $1.4 million.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. During the years ended 2021 and 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $106.2
million and $98.8 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative costs include BELBUCA, and Symproic sales, marketing, commercial and
amortization expenses. These costs also include legal expenses, professional fees, wages and stock-based compensation expense. The year over year
increase in SG&A costs were driven primarily by increased sales and marketing efforts, higher legal expenditures, and the preparation of the ELYXYB
launch, which occurred in Q1 2022.
Interest Expense, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net interest expense of $7.5 million, consisting of $7.2 million of
scheduled interest payments and $0.3 million of related amortization of discount and loan costs for the new debt arrangement. This has been partially
offset by interest income of $0.04 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net interest expense of $7.0 million, consisting of $7.0 million of scheduled interest payments
and $0.3 million of related amortization of discount and loan costs for the new debt arrangement. This has been partially offset by interest income of
$0.3 million.
Information pertaining to fiscal year 2019 was included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 on
page 28 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on
March 12, 2021.
Refer to Note 9, “Net sales by product” for more information related to (i) net product sales for BELBUCA, Symproic and BUNAVAIL, and (ii) the
percentages related to each product.
Non-GAAP Financial Information:
We report our consolidated financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) and other non-GAAP results should not be considered in isolation of or as an alternative for, earnings measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to measure the ongoing operating performance of our Company along
with other metrics, and for planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, when evaluating non-GAAP results, we exclude certain items that are
considered to be non-cash and if applicable, non-recurring, in nature.
EBITDA and Non-GAAP Income/(Loss):
We have presented EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating
performance and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe this financial measure helps identify underlying trends in our
business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses
eliminated in calculating EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we
believe that EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall
understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our
management in its financial and operational decision-making.
EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income/(loss), which is the nearest GAAP
equivalent. Some of these limitations are:
• EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have
to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in EBITDA;
• EBITDA does not reflect provision for (benefit from) income taxes or the cash requirements to pay taxes; and
• EBITDA excludes net interest, including both interest expense and interest income.
Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is an alternative view of our performance that we are providing because management believes this information
enhances investors’ understanding of our results as it permits investors to better understand the ongoing operations of the business, the impact of any
non-recurring one-time events, the cash results of the organization and is an additional measure used by management to assess performance.
Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP net income/(loss) rather than net income/(loss),
which is the nearest GAAP equivalent. Some of these limitations are:
32

Table of Contents
• Non-GAAP income/(loss) excludes certain one-time items because of the nature of the items and the impact that those have on the analysis of
underlying business performance and trends. Specifically, in the presentation of non-GAAP income/(loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021,
we have excluded the deferred tax benefit of $56.7 million, as it is non-recurring. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we have excluded
the financial impact of our debt refinancing which closed in May 2019, as it is non-recurring. This excluded item is a significant component in
understanding and assessing ongoing financial performance. The one-time expenses related to the payoff of the CRG loan consisted of $5.2
million in unamortized deferred loan fees, $3.9 million in unamortized warrant discount costs and $2.8 million in loan prepayment fees and
realized losses, for a cumulative total of $11.9 million in one-time costs. Also, we have excluded the non-recurring financial impact of the
BUNAVAIL discontinuation, for a cumulative total of $0.3 million in 2020 and $3.8 million in 2019, and we have excluded the cash portion of the
non-recurring financial impact of the CEO transition, for a cumulative total of $1.7 million in 2020;
• The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP net income/(loss) may differ from the expenses and other items, if
any, that other companies may exclude from non-GAAP net income/(loss) when they report their operating results since non-GAAP income/(loss) is
not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, and it has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP;
• We exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP net income/(loss) although (a) it has been, and will likely continue to be for the
foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy and (b) if we did not pay
out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would likely
be higher, which would affect our cash position;
• We exclude amortization of intangible assets from non-GAAP net income/(loss) due to the non-cash nature of this expense and although it has
been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a recurring expense for our business, these expenses do not affect our cash position; and
• Amortization of warrant discount costs associated with the CRG loan which was dissolved in May 2019 are excluded given these expenses did not
affect our cash position;

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity securities, proceeds from borrowings, convertible notes, and
notes payable, funded research arrangements, revenue generated as a result of our worldwide license and development agreements and the
commercialization of our BELBUCA, Symproic and BUNAVAIL products. We intend to finance our commercialization and working capital needs from
existing cash, earnings from the commercialization of BELBUCA and Symproic, royalty revenue, new sources of debt and equity financing, existing and
new licensing and commercial partnership agreements and, potentially, through the exercise of outstanding common stock options and warrants to
purchase common stock. We expect to incur additional costs in preparation for the commercialization of ELYXYB in Q1 2022.
At December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $114.3 million. We generated $41.0 million of cash in operations during the year ended
December 31, 2021 and had stockholders’ equity of $187.8 million, versus stockholders’ equity of $108.2 million at December 31, 2020. We believe that
we have sufficient current cash, along with expected proceeds from sales of BELBUCA and Symproic, to manage the business as currently planned.
Additional capital may be required to support the continued commercialization of our BELBUCA and Symproic products, our commercial launch of
ELYXYB, or other products which may be acquired or licensed by us, and for general working capital requirements. Based on agreements with our
partners, the ability to scale up or reduce personnel and associated costs are factors considered throughout the product life cycle. Available resources
may be consumed more rapidly than currently anticipated, potentially resulting in the need for additional funding.
Accordingly, it is possible that we may be required to raise additional capital, which may be available to us through a variety of sources, including:
• public equity markets;
• private equity financings;
• commercialization agreements and collaborative arrangements;
• grants and new license revenues;
• bank loans;
• equipment financing;
• public or private debt; and
• exercise of existing warrants and options.
Readers are cautioned that additional funding, capital or loans (including, without limitation, milestone or other payments from commercialization
agreements) may be unavailable on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus
our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies and drug formulations or
potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations in 2022 and beyond.
To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in
ownership dilution to existing stockholders.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest rate risk
Our cash includes all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short-term maturities of our cash,
we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments. We maintain cash equivalent
balances with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Our cash and cash equivalents accounts at times may exceed
federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk from cash and
cash equivalents.
Foreign currency exchange risk
We currently have, and may in the future have increased, commercial, manufacturing and clinical agreements which are denominated in Euros or
other foreign currencies. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between
the U.S. dollar or Euro or other applicable currencies, or by weak economic conditions in Europe or elsewhere in the world. Such amounts are currently
immaterial to our financial position or results of operations. We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities.
Market Risk
We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the
recapitalization of our business, we have entered into a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan. Our term loan note bears interest which includes
fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR.
Additionally, LIBOR is to be phased out by June 23, 2023 and replaced. However, we will not be required to renegotiate our loan documents with our
current lender.
Market indexed security risk
We have issued warrants to various holders underlying shares of our common stock. These warrant investments were measured at their fair value at
date of issuance and recorded as warrant expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. We use the Black-Scholes model for
valuation of the warrants.

the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's
rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and
principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2021.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control
system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if
any, within a company have been detected. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the
end of the period covered by this Report that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the
objectives of our disclosure control system were met.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
As required by the SEC rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
our company,
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors, and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO). Based on our assessments and those criteria,
management determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2021.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 9, 2022 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a
separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Reserve for product returns
Description of the The Company sells pharmaceutical drugs primarily to national wholesalers, which in turn may resell the products to
Matter smaller or regional wholesalers, retail pharmacies, chain drug stores, government agencies and other third parties.
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes product sales net of
estimated allowances for product returns. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $8.8 million in accrued returns,
which are a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company establishes allowances for
estimated returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors, including the specific contractual terms
of agreements with customers, the historical returns of products, direct communication with customers, anticipated
introduction of competitive products or generics, anticipated pricing strategy changes by the Company and/or its
competitors, analysis of prescription data gathered by a third-party prescription data providers, and the estimated
remaining shelf life of product
Auditing the Company’s measurement of the returns accrual required significant auditor judgement because the
calculation involved subjective management assumptions about the number of units that could be returned in future
periods under the Company’s return policy. The estimate was based on historical return trends by product or return
trends of similar products as well as adjustments based on qualitative factors.
How We Addressed We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that
the Matter in Our addressed the identified risks related to the Company's process for calculating the product return accruals including
Audit controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimates.
To test the returns accrual, our audit procedures included, among other procedures, testing the accuracy and
completeness of the underlying data used in the calculations and evaluating the significant assumptions used by
management to estimate its reserves. We assessed management’s estimates by evaluating current and future
market events, based on our knowledge of the industry and other macro-economic considerations. We also
performed sensitivity analyses to determine the effect of changes in assumptions.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
balance sheet of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and
the related notes and financial statement schedule and our report dated March 9, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. Nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies:
Organization
BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Indiana on January 6, 1997 and reincorporated as a
Delaware corporation in 2002. The Company’s subsidiaries are Arius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Arius One”) and Arius Two, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“Arius Two”), each of which are wholly-owned.
The Company is a rapidly growing specialty pharmaceutical company working to deliver innovative therapies for individuals living with serious and
debilitating chronic conditions. The Company has built a portfolio of products that includes utilizing its novel and proprietary BioErodible
MucoAdhesive, or BEMA, drug-delivery technology to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapies aimed at addressing
important unmet medical needs. The Company commercializes its products in the U.S. using its own sales force while working in partnership with
third parties to commercialize its products outside the U.S.
As used herein, the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is referred to as the “Common Stock” and the Company’s preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share, is referred to as the “Preferred Stock”.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Arius One and Arius Two. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
Significant accounting policies:
Use of estimates in financial statements
The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company reviews all
significant estimates affecting the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
to their issuance. Significant estimates made by the Company include: revenue recognition associated with sales allowances such as government
program rebates, customer voucher redemptions, commercial contracts, rebates and chargebacks; sales returns reserves; sales bonuses; stock-
based compensation; and deferred income taxes.
Concentration of risks
Concentration of customers

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
Concentration of suppliers
The following suppliers accounted for 10% or more of inventory purchases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020. and 2019.
Year Ended December 31,

B 4,362 3,756 1,755
C * 2,603 11,218
* Represents less than 10% of inventory purchases.
Concentrations of credit risk
Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value due
to their short-term nature. The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company places cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States that management believes are of high credit quality. The Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") covers $0.25 million for substantially all depository accounts.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institution to the extent that cash and cash equivalent balances
recorded in the balance sheets are in excess of the amounts that are insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses on its
deposits since inception, and management believes that minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions.
Liquidity
At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of approximately $114.3 million. The Company generated $41.0 million of cash in operations during
the year ended December 31, 2021 and had stockholders’ equity of $187.8 million, versus stockholders’ equity of $108.2 million at December 31,
2020. The Company believes that it has sufficient cash, along with expected proceeds from sales of BELBUCA and Symproic, to manage the business
as currently planned.
Additional capital may be required to support the continued commercialization of the Company's BELBUCA and Symproic products, the commercial
launch of ELYXYB, or other products which may be acquired or licensed by the Company, and for general working capital requirements. Based on
agreements with the Company's partners, the ability to scale up or reduce personnel and associated costs are factors considered throughout the
product life cycle. Available resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently anticipated, potentially resulting in the need for additional
funding.
Accounts receivable
The Company's accounts receivable balance consists of amounts due from product sales. Receivables are recorded net of allowances for trade
discounts, distribution fees, prompt pay discounts, and doubtful accounts.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and does not require collateral. As appropriate, the Company establishes provisions for potential
credit losses. The Company recorded $0.01 million in allowances for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2021 and in 2020, respectively. The
Company writes off accounts receivable when management determines they are uncollectible and credits payments subsequently received on such
receivables to bad debt expense in the period received.

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with costs determined for each batch under the first-in, first-out method and
specifically allocated to remaining inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Raw materials include amounts
of active pharmaceutical ingredient for a product to be manufactured, work in process includes the bulk inventory of laminate (the Company’s drug
delivery film) prior to being packaged for sale, and finished goods include pharmaceutical products ready for commercial sale.
On a quarterly basis, the Company analyzes its inventory levels and records allowances for inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a
cost basis more than the expected net realizable value and inventory that is more than expected demand based upon projected product sales. The
Company recorded $4.2 million and $2.3 million in reserves for inventory obsolescence as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Inventory is composed of the following at December 31:
2021 2020
Raw Materials & Supplies $ 3,674 $ 3,389
Work-in-process 9,926 9,949
Finished Goods 14,291 6,359
Inventory Reserve (4,180) (2,254)
Total Inventories $ 23,711 $ 17,443
Property and equipment
The Company records property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is computed on a straight-line basis over its estimated
useful lives, generally 3 to 10 years.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amount may not be
recoverable. In connection with the discontinuation of the marketing of BUNAVAIL, the company recorded an additional $0.3 million and $1.5 million
of depreciation related to certain equipment used in the production of BUNAVAIL, during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has certain
manufacturing equipment that isn’t currently in production, which has been deemed idle. The Company impaired certain obsolete office equipment
totaling $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no impairment of equipment recorded during the year ended 2021.
Intangibles and goodwill
The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives (“other intangible assets”) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows over the
remaining life of its other intangible assets, or related group of assets where applicable, in measuring whether the assets to be held and used will be
realizable. In the event of impairment, the Company would discount the future cash flows using its then estimated incremental borrowing rate to
estimate the amount of the impairment.
There were no impairment charges recognized on finite lived intangibles in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Estimated
Useful Lives
Licenses 15 years
BELBUCA license and distribution rights 10 years
Symproic license and distribution rights 12 years
ELYXYB product rights 15 years
F-13

Table of Contents
BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. During the evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill, either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment may be
performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that it is more likely than not that no impairment exists, then no further analysis is performed. If a
qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is performed.
If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded based on that difference. There were no goodwill impairment charges
in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC606"), which was adopted on
January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method.
Product sales
Product sales amounts relate to sales of BELBUCA, Symproic and formerly BUNAVAIL. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales when
control of the promised goods is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for
transferring those goods. The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are
identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. When determining
whether the customer has obtained control of the goods, the Company considers any future performance obligations. Generally, there is no post-
shipment obligation on product sold. The Company discontinued marketing of BUNAVAIL in June 2020.
Product royalty revenues
Product royalty revenue amounts are based on sales revenue of the PAINKYL™ product under the Company’s license agreement with TTY and the
BREAKYL™ product under the Company’s license agreement with Meda AB, which was acquired by Mylan N.V. (which we refer to herein as Mylan).
Product royalty revenues are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the license partner in an amount that reflects the
consideration expected to be received. Supplemental sales-based product royalty revenue may also be earned upon the subsequent sale of the
product at agreed upon contractual rates.
Contract revenue
Contract revenue amounts are related to milestone payments under the Company’s license agreements with its partners including any associated
financing component.
Performance obligations
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated
to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the
Company’s product sales contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable
from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. The Company has determined that the delivery of its product to its customers
constitutes a single performance obligation as there are no other promises to deliver goods or services. Shipping and handling activities are
considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. The Company has assessed the existence of a
significant financing component in the agreements with its customers. The trade payment terms with its customers do not exceed one year and
therefore the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.
Transaction price, including variable consideration
Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established.
Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, government chargebacks, discounts and rebates,
and other incentives, such as voucher programs, and other fee for service
F-14

BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
amounts that are detailed within contracts between the Company and its customers relating to the Company’s sale of its products.
The Company establishes allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative
factors, including:
• specific contractual terms of agreements with customers;
• estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel;
• historical rebates, chargebacks and returns of products;
• direct communication with customers;
• anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics;
• anticipated pricing strategy changes by the Company and/or its competitors;
• analysis of prescription data gathered by third-party prescription data providers;
• the impact of changes in state and federal regulations; and
• the estimated remaining shelf life of products.
Revenue from product sales is recorded after considering the impact of the following variable consideration amounts at the time of revenue
recognition:
Product returns-Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers contractual return rights that allow its customers to return the products within
an 18-month period that begins six months prior to and ends twelve months after expiration of the products. In connection with the 2020
discontinuation of marketing of BUNAVAIL, the 2019 results included a reserve of $2.2 million for additional BUNAVAIL product returns.
Subsequently, the majority of these reserves were released during 2020, as the Company did not experience an increase in the rate of returns
following the discontinuation announcement, nor upon the actual discontinuation.
Government rebates and chargebacks-Government rebates and chargebacks include mandated discounts under Medicaid, Medicare, U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs and other government agencies ("Government Payors"). The Company estimates the rebates and chargebacks to
Government Payors based upon a combination of historical experience, product pricing, estimated payor mix, product growth, and the mix of
contract and agreement terms. These reserves are recorded in the same period the revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product
revenue and the establishment of a current liability, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the pricing of covered products under Medicaid is subject to complex calculations and involves
interpretation of government rules, regulations and policies as well as adjustments based on current trends in utilization. For Medicare, the Company
also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom the Company will owe an additional liability under the
Medicare Part D program. The Company estimates the rebates and chargebacks that it will provide to Government Payors based upon (i) the
government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs, (ii) information obtained from its customers and (iii) information
obtained from other third parties regarding the payor mix for its products. The Company’s liability for these rebates consists of estimates of claims
for the current quarter and estimated future claims that will be made for product shipments that have been recognized as revenue, but remain in
the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.
Commercial Contracts-The Company’s estimates of rebates arising from commercial contracts are based on its estimated mix of various third-party
payers, which are contractually entitled to discounts from the Company’s listed prices of its products. If the mix across third-party payers is different
from the Company’s estimates, the Company may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and/or chargebacks than it had
estimated.
Patient Assistance Voucher program-The Company, from time to time, offers certain promotional product-related incentives to eligible patients. The
Company has voucher programs for BELBUCA and Symproic whereby the Company offers a point-of-sale subsidy to retail consumers. The Company
estimates its liabilities for these voucher programs based on the current utilization and historical redemption rates as reported to the Company by a
third-party claims processing organization. The Company accounts for the costs of these special promotional programs as price adjustments, which
are a reduction of gross revenue.

BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
Trade discounts and distribution fees-Trade discounts relate to prompt settlement discounts provided to customers. In addition, the Company
compensates its customers for distribution of its products and the provision of data. The Company has determined that such services received to
date are not distinct from its sale of products and may not reasonably represent fair value for these services. Therefore, estimates of these
payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on contractual terms.
License and development agreements
The Company periodically enters into license and development agreements to develop and commercialize its products. The arrangements typically
are multi-deliverable arrangements that are funded through upfront payments, milestone payments and other forms of payment. The Company
currently has license agreements that are described in note 7, of which these revenues are classified as contract revenue.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the direct costs attributable to the production of BELBUCA, Symproic and formerly BUNAVAIL. It includes raw materials,
production costs at the Company’s three contract manufacturing sites, quality testing directly related to the products, inventory reserves, and
depreciation on equipment that the Company had purchased to produce BELBUCA, Symproic and formerly BUNAVAIL. It also includes any batches
not meeting specifications and raw material yield losses. Yield losses and batches not meeting specifications are expensed as incurred. Cost of sales
is recognized when sold to the wholesaler from our distribution center.
For BREAKYL and PAINKYL (the Company’s out-licensed breakthrough cancer pain therapies), cost of sales includes all costs related to creating the
product at the Company’s contract manufacturing location in Germany. The Company’s contract manufacturer bills the Company for the final
product, which includes materials, direct labor costs, and certain overhead costs as outlined in applicable supply agreements.
Cost of sales also includes royalty expenses that the Company owes to third parties.
Advertising
Advertising costs, which include promotional expenses and the cost of placebo samples, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $20.9
million, $11.0 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Shipping and handling costs
Shipping and handling costs, which include expenses from our wholesalers, are expensed as incurred. Shipping and handling costs were $0.05
million, $0.03 million and $0.03 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-based compensation
The Company has a stock-based compensation plan under which various types of equity-based awards are granted, including stock options,
performance-based options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based RSUs. The fair value of stock option and RSUs, which are subject
only to service conditions with graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the service period,
net of estimated forfeitures. The fair values of performance-based options and RSUs are recognized as compensation expense beginning from when
the performance is determined to be probable to the end of the performance period. The Company uses the fair-value based method to determine
compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (warrants and options). The
grant date fair value of an RSU equals the closing price of our common stock on the trading day of the grant date. The fair value of each option and
warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends,
expected term, and
F-16

Table of Contents
BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and other factors estimated over the
expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is derived using the “simplified method” which computes expected term as the
average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield.
In applying the Black-Scholes options-pricing model, assumptions are as follows:
2021 2020 2019
Expected price volatility 53.70%-59.87% 59.00%-61.76% 61.66%-64.10%
Risk-free interest rate 0.50%-1.38% 0.25%-1.68% 1.36%-2.66%
Weighted average expected life in years 6 years 6 years 6 years
Dividend yield — — —
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company measures the fair value of instruments in accordance with GAAP which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. GAAP also
establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value. The Company considers the carrying amount of its cash and cash equivalents to approximate fair value due to short-
term nature of this instrument. GAAP describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable
Level 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)
The following table summarizes the cash and cash equivalents measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021:
Balance at
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2021
Cash and cash equivalents $ 114,309 — — $114,309
The cash and cash equivalent balance as of December 31, 2021 includes investments in various money market accounts and cash held in interest
bearing accounts.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning strategies in making that assessment.
We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions
are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the
period in which the change in judgment occurs. Our policy for
F-17

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
recording interest and penalties associated with audits is that penalties and interest expense are recorded in provision for income taxes in our
statements of operations.
The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. Interest and, if applicable, penalties are recognized
related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There are no accruals for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2021.
Measurement of credit losses of financial instruments
The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through its product sales. The Company assesses each counterparty’s ability to pay for the
products it sells by conducting a credit review. The credit review considers the Company's expected billing exposure and timing for payment and the
counterparty’s established credit rating or the Company's assessment of the counterparty’s creditworthiness based on the Company's analysis of
their financial statements when a credit rating is not available. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, and business strategy in
its evaluation. A credit limit is established for each counterparty based on the outcome of this review.
The Company monitors its ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty balances against contract terms and due dates. The
Company's activities include timely account reconciliations, dispute resolution and payment confirmations. The Company may employ collection
agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to
simplify accounting for income taxes. It removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve
consistent application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020
and early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted Topic 740 during 2021 and determined that the new guidance did not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company has reviewed other new accounting pronouncements that were issued as of December 31, 2021 and does not believe that these
pronouncements are applicable to the Company, or that they will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50
percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance with
respect to all of the Company’s deferred tax assets for the year ended 2020 in the amount of $66.5 million and recorded a valuation allowance
related to the federal R&D credit and state NOL’s in the amount of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net decrease in the

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
The Company has a federal net operating loss carry forward (“NOLs”) of approximately $218 million as of December 31, 2021. Under Section 382
and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a “loss corporation”, as defined, there are annual limitations on
the amount of the NOLs and other deductions, which are available to the Company. The Company has determined that the portion of the NOLs
incurred prior to May 16, 2006 is subject to this limitation. As such, the use of these NOLs to offset taxable income is limited to approximately $1.5
million per year. The Company has state NOLs of approximately $222 million as of December 31, 2021. These state NOLs expire in various years
through 2038 and certain state NOLs generated in 2018 have an indefinite carryforward period. The federal NOLs incurred through December 31,
2017 expire between 2024 and 2037. The federal NOL generated in 2018 has an indefinite carryforward life due to tax reform.
Management has evaluated all other tax positions that could have a significant effect on the financial statements and determined that the Company
has no uncertain income tax positions at December 31, 2021.
One or more of the Company’s legal entities file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state jurisdictions. The
Company’s income tax returns are subject to audit by the tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes may arise with authorities
involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax
jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and the interpretation of the relevant facts. The Company is no longer
subject to U.S. federal or state tax examinations for years ended on or before December 31, 2017.

12. Earnings per common share:
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
December 31,
2021 2020 2019
Basic:
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, basic $ 84,860 $ 25,711 $ (15,305)
Weighted average common shares outstanding 99,320,285 99,830,520 83,213,704
Basic income (loss) per common share $ 0.85 $ 0.26 $ (0.18)
Diluted:
Effect of dilutive securities:
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, diluted $ 84,860 $ 25,711 $ (15,305)
Weighted average common shares outstanding 99,320,285 99,830,520 83,213,704
Effect of dilutive options and warrants 3,972,703 5,232,002 —
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 103,292,988 105,062,522 83,213,704
Diluted income (loss) per common share $ 0.82 $ 0.24 $ (0.18)
Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Common
equivalent shares from stock options, RSUs, warrants and convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock method, are also included in the
diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive.
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, outstanding stock options, RSUs, warrants and convertible preferred stock of 3,972,703 and
5,232,002, respectively, were included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share. During the year ended 2019, outstanding stock
options, RSUs, warrants and convertible preferred stock of 11,116,195, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share,
because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect because the outstanding exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares during the relevant periods. Included in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are the Series B shares as converted
to common stock.
The following is the total outstanding options, RSUs and warrants for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

13. Retirement plan:
The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan covers all employees
who meet certain eligibility and participation requirements. Participants may contribute up to 90% of their eligible earnings, as limited by law. The
Company makes a matching contribution equal to 100% on the first 5% of participant contributions to the plan. The Company made contributions of
approximately $1.1 million , $1.1 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 2021, 2020 and 2019.

14. Commitments and contingencies:
Indemnifications
The Company’s directors and officers are indemnified against costs and expenses related to stockholder and other claims (i.e., only actions taken in
their capacity as officers and directors) that are not covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policy. This indemnification is
ongoing and does not include a limit on the maximum potential future payments, nor are there any recourse provisions or collateral that may offset
the cost.
Post marketing requirements
On October 5, 2017, the Company entered a subsequent party acknowledgement relating to its participation in the Opioid PMR Consortium (the
“OPC”). The participants are member companies, collectively undertaking various observational and clinical studies to satisfy certain post-marketing
requirements by the FDA as holders of a NDA for extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics. As a requirement of joining the OPC, the
Company was required to pay its share of the previous expenses incurred and funded by the existing member companies. The Company’s pro-rata
share of such expenses totaled approximately $4.3 million, which was paid during the fourth quarter of 2019. Ongoing expenses are shared equally
by the member companies and were paid monthly during 2021 and 2020. Future ongoing expenses are anticipated to be paid monthly in 2022
through 2023.
Certain rights of CDC IV
The Company and CDC IV are parties to the CDLA pursuant to which CDC IV has previously provided funds to the Company for the development of
the Company’s ONSOLIS product. CDC IV is entitled to receive a mid-single digit royalty based on net sales of ONSOLIS, including minimum royalties
of $375,000 per quarter beginning in the second full year following commercial launch. The royalty term expires upon the latter of expiration of the
patent or generic entry into a particular country.
In September 2007, in connection with CDC IV’s consent to the North American Mylan transaction, the Company, among other transactions with CDC
IV, granted CDC IV a 1% royalty on net sales of the next BEMA product, which was BUNAVAIL. CDC IV’s right to the royalty shall immediately
terminate at any time if annual net sales of BUNAVAIL equal less than $7.5 million in any calendar year following the third anniversary of initial
launch of the product and CDC IV receives $0.02 million in three (3) consecutive quarters as payment for CDC IV’s one percent (1)% royalty during
such calendar year.
In April 2016, CDC IV exercised its right pursuant to the Royalty Purchase and Amendment Agreement to exchange its royalty rights to the next
BEMA product which was BUNAVAIL, in favor of royalty rights to the Substitute BEMA product which is BELBUCA (the CDC IV Option).
The Company records such royalties as costs of sales occur.
Indivior (formerly RB Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) and Aquestive Therapeutics (formerly MonoSol Rx)
The following disclosure regarding the Company’s ongoing litigations with Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly MonoSol Rx, “Aquestive”) and
Indivior PLC (formerly RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, “Indivior”) is intended to provide some background and an update on the matter as per
disclosure requirements of the SEC. Additional details regarding the past procedural history of the matter can be found in the Company’s previously
filed periodic filings with the SEC.
Litigation related to BUNAVAIL
On October 29, 2013, Reckitt Benckiser, Inc., Indivior, and Aquestive (collectively, the “RB Plaintiffs”) filed an action against the Company relating to
its BUNAVAIL product in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (“EDNC”) for alleged patent infringement.
BUNAVAIL is a drug approved for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. The RB Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL, which
has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its US Patent No. 8,475,832 (the “‘832 Patent”). On May 21, 2014, the Court granted the Company’s
motion to dismiss.

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
On January 22, 2014, Aquestive initiated an inter partes review (“IPR”) on U.S. Patent No. 7,579,019, the (“‘019 Patent”). The PTAB upheld all claims
of the Company’s ‘019 Patent in 2015 and this decision was not appealed by Aquestive.
On September 20, 2014, the Company proactively filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the EDNC requesting the
Court to make a determination that the Company’s BUNAVAIL product does not infringe the ‘832 Patent, US Patent No. 7,897,080 (the “‘080 Patent”)
and US Patent No. 8,652,378 (the “‘378 Patent”). The Company invalidated the “‘080 Patent” in its entirety in an inter partes reexamination
proceeding. The Company invalidated all relevant claims of the ‘832 Patent in an IPR proceeding. And, in an IPR proceeding for the ‘378 Patent, in its
decision not to institute the IPR proceeding, the PTAB construed the claims of the ‘378 Patent narrowly. Shortly thereafter, by joint motion of the
parties, the ‘378 Patent was subsequently removed from the action.
On June 6, 2016, in an unrelated case in which Indivior and Aquestive asserted the ‘832 Patent against other parties, the Delaware District Court
entered an order invalidating other claims in the ‘832 Patent. Indivior and Aquestive did not appeal the Delaware Court’s holding that other claims of
the ‘832 Patent are invalid. On February 10, 2021, the parties in our EDNC declaratory judgment action filed a covenant by Indivior and Aquestive
not to sue us for infringement of the ‘832 Patent. In view of that covenant and the prior invalidation of the ‘080 patent, we filed a notice of voluntary
dismissal of the Company’s EDNC declaratory judgement action.
On September 22, 2014, the RB Plaintiffs filed an action against the Company (and the Company’s commercial partner) relating to the Company’s
BUNAVAIL product in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement. The RB Plaintiffs claim that
BUNAVAIL, whose formulation and manufacturing processes have never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent U.S. Patent No. 8,765,167 (the
“‘167 Patent”). The Company believes this is an anticompetitive attempt by the RB Plaintiffs to distract the Company’s efforts from commercializing
BUNAVAIL.
On December 12, 2014, the Company filed a motion to transfer the case from New Jersey to North Carolina and a motion to dismiss the case against
its commercial partner. On October 28, 2014, the Company filed multiple IPR petitions on certain claims of the ‘167 Patent. The USPTO instituted
three of the four IPR petitions. The PTAB upheld the claims and denied collateral estoppel applied to the PTAB decisions in March 2016. The
Company appealed to Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The USPTO intervened with respect to whether collateral estoppel applied to the
PTAB.
On June 19, 2018, the Company filed a motion to remand the case for further consideration by the PTAB in view of intervening authority. On July 31,
2018, the Federal Circuit vacated the decisions, and remanded the ‘167 Patent IPRs for further consideration on the merits.
On February 7, 2019, the PTAB issued three decisions on remand purporting to deny institution of the three previously instituted IPRs of the ‘167
patent. On March 11, 2019, the Company timely appealed the PTAB decisions on remand to U.S. Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit. On March
20, 2019, Aquestive and Indivior moved to dismiss the appeal, and the Company opposed that motion.
On August 29, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted the motion and dismissed the Company’s appeal. On
September 30, 2019, the Company filed a petition for an en banc rehearing of the order dismissing the Company’s appeal by the full Federal Circuit
Court of Appeals.
On January 13, 2020, by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied BDSI’s petition for en banc rehearing of the dismissal of BDSI’s appeal
relating to inter partes review proceedings on the ’167 patent. On June 11, 2020, BDSI filed a petition for certiorari seeking U.S. Supreme Court
review of the Federal Circuit’s decision. On October 5, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Company’s petition for certiorari.
On May 18, 2021, the RB Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint dropping the Company’s commercial partner from the action it began on September
22, 2014. On June 1, 2021, the Company answered the amended complaint asserting counter-claims of non-infringement, invalidity, and
unenforceability. The Company strongly refutes as without merit the Plaintiffs’ assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the
lawsuit.

Litigation related to BELBUCA
On January 13, 2017, Aquestive filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging BELBUCA infringes the ‘167
Patent. In lieu of answering the complaint, the Company filed motions to dismiss the complaint and, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the
EDNC. On July 25, 2017, the New Jersey Court administratively terminated the case pending the parties submission of a joint stipulation of transfer
because the District of New Jersey was an inappropriate venue. This case was later transferred to the Delaware District Court. On October 31, 2017,
the Company filed motions to dismiss the complaint and, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the EDNC. On October 16, 2018, denying the
motion to dismiss as moot, the Delaware District Court granted the Company’s motion to transfer the case to the EDNC. On November 20, 2018, the
Company moved the EDNC to dismiss the complaint for patent infringement for failure to state a claim for relief.
On August 6, 2019, the EDNC granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On or about November 11,
2019, Aquestive refiled a complaint in the EDNC against the Company alleging that BELBUCA infringes the ‘167 Patent. On January 13, 2020, in lieu
of answering the complaint, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After the two motions were denied, on April 16, 2020, we answered the
complaint. Aquestive moved to dismiss our counter-claim of unenforceability, but the court denied that motion. The Company strongly refutes as
without merit Aquestive’s assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit.
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA (formerly Actavis)
On February 8, 2016, the Company received a notice relating to a Paragraph IV certification from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, or (formerly Actavis,
“Teva”) seeking to find invalid three Orange Book listed patents relating specifically to BUNAVAIL. The Paragraph IV certification related to an ANDA
filed by Teva with the FDA for a generic formulation of BUNAVAIL. The patents subject to Teva’s certification were the ‘019 Patent, U.S. Patent No.
8,147,866 (the “‘866 Patent”) and 8,703,177 (the “‘177 Patent”).
On March 18, 2016, the Company asserted three different patents against Teva, the ‘019 Patent, the ‘866 Patent, and the ‘177 Patent. Teva did not
raise non-infringement positions about the ‘019 and the ‘866 Patents in its Paragraph IV certification. Teva did raise a non-infringement position on
the ‘177 Patent but the Company asserted in its complaint that Teva infringed the ‘177 Patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.
On December 20, 2016 the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,522,188 (the “‘188 Patent””), and this patent was properly listed in the Orange Book as
covering the BUNAVAIL product. On February 23, 2017 Teva sent a Paragraph IV certification adding the 9,522,188 to its ANDA. An amended
Complaint was filed, adding the ‘188 Patent to the litigation.
On January 31, 2017, the Company received a notice relating to a Paragraph IV certification from Teva relating to Teva’s ANDA on additional
strengths of BUNAVAIL and on March 16, 2017, the Company brought suit against Teva and its parent company on these additional strengths. On
June 20, 2017, the Court entered orders staying both BUNAVAIL suits at the request of the parties.
On May 23, 2017, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent 9,655,843 (the “‘843 Patent”) relating to the BEMA technology, and this patent was properly listed in
the Orange Book as covering the BUNAVAIL product.
Finally, on October 12, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with Teva that resolved the Company’s
BUNAVAIL patent litigation against Teva pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. As part of the Settlement Agreement, which is
subject to review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, the Company has entered into a non-exclusive license
agreement with Teva that permits Teva to first begin selling its generic version of BUNAVAIL in the U.S. on July 23, 2028 or earlier under certain
circumstances. Other terms of the agreement are confidential.
The Company received notices regarding Paragraph IV certifications from Teva on November 8, 2016, November 10, 2016, and December 22, 2016,
seeking to find invalid two Orange Book listed patents relating specifically to BELBUCA. The Paragraph IV certifications relate to three ANDAs filed by
Teva with the FDA for a generic formulation of BELBUCA. The patents subject to Teva’s certification were the ‘019 Patent and the ‘866 Patent. The
Company filed complaints in Delaware against Teva on December 22, 2016 and February 3, 2017 in which it asserted against Teva the ‘019 Patent
and the ‘866 Patent. Teva did not contest infringement of the claims of the ‘019 Patent and did not contest

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
infringement of the claims of the ‘866 Patent. The ‘019 Patent had already been the subject of an unrelated IPR before the USPTO under which the
Company prevailed, and all claims of the ‘019 Patent survived. Aquestive’s request for rehearing of the final IPR decision regarding the ‘019 Patent
was denied by the USPTO on December 19, 2016. Aquestive did not file a timely appeal at the Federal Circuit.
On May 23, 2017, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent 9,655,843 (the “‘843 Patent”) relating to the BEMA technology, and this patent was properly listed in
the Orange Book as covering the BELBUCA product.
On August 28, 2017, the Court entered orders staying both BELBUCA suits at the request of the parties.
In February 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with Teva that resolved the Company’s BELBUCA patent
litigation against Teva pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. As part of the settlement agreement, which is subject to review
by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, the Company has granted Teva a non-exclusive license (for which the
Company will receive no current or future payments) that permits Teva to first begin selling the generic version of the Company’s BELBUCA product
in the U.S. on January 23, 2027 or earlier under certain circumstances (including, for example, upon (i) the delisting of the patents-in-suit from the
U.S. FDA Orange Book, (ii) the granting of a license by us to a third party to launch another generic form of BELBUCA at a date prior to January 23,
2027, or (iii) the occurrence of certain conditions regarding BELBUCA market share). Other terms of the Agreement are confidential.
Alvogen
On September 7, 2018, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement in Delaware against Alvogen Pb Research & Development LLC,
Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd., Alvogen Pine Brook LLC, Alvogen, Incorporated, and Alvogen Group, Incorporated (collectively, “Alvogen”), asserting
that Alvogen infringes the Company’s Orange Book listed patents for BELBUCA, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,147,866 and 9,655,843, both expiring in
July of 2027, and U.S. Patent No. 9,901,539, expiring in December of 2032. This complaint follows receipt by the Company on July 30, 2018 of a
Paragraph IV Patent Certification from Alvogen stating that Alvogen had filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of BELBUCA Buccal Film (75
mcg, 150 mcg, 300 mcg, 450 mcg, 600 mcg, 750 mcg and 900 mcg). Because the Company initiated a patent infringement suit to defend the
patents identified in the Paragraph IV notice within 45 days after receipt of the Paragraph IV Certification, the FDA is prevented from approving the
ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or a decision in the case that each of the patents is not infringed or invalid. Alvogen’s notice letter also does not
provide any information on the timing or approval status of its ANDA.
In its Paragraph IV Certification, Alvogen does not contest infringement of at least several independent claims of each of the ’866, ’843, and ’539
patents. Rather, Alvogen advances only invalidly arguments for these independent claims. The Company believes that it will be able to prevail on its
claims of infringement of these patents, particularly as Alvogen does not contest infringement of certain claims of each patent. Additionally, as the
Company has done in the past, it intends to vigorously defend its intellectual property against assertions of invalidity. Each of the three patents
carry a presumption of validity, which can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.
The Court scheduled a bench trial to commence on November 9, 2020 to adjudicate issues concerning the validity of the Orange Book patents listed
for BELBUCA. On October 6, 2020, the Court rescheduled the bench trial with Alvogen to commence on March 1, 2021. A three day bench trial
against Alvogen was conducted commencing on March 1, 2021. At the conclusion of trial, the Court ordered the parties to submit post-trial briefs.
Post-trial briefing was completed on May 26, 2021. The Company subsequently moved the Court to strike (i.e., remove from the Court’s
consideration) three patent invalidity defenses raised for the first time in Alvogen’s post-trial briefs and two documents improperly cited in Alvogen’s
post-trial briefs. On June 28, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s motion to strike in its entirety. In addition, on June 28, 2021, the Court enjoined
Alvogen from launching its generic product until the Court issues its final decision on the merits.
On September 21, 2021, the Company filed under seal a Motion for Order to Show Cause why Defendants Should not be Held in Contempt for
Violating the Court Order of June 28, 2021 (the “Motion”). On June 28, 2021, citing the statute authorizing the Court to extend the 30-month stay
under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the Court ordered Alvogen (as defined below) not to “launch” its generic product until it could reach a final decision
on the merits in the case. In the Motion, the Company contends that Alvogen violated the order of the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware
F-35

(U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
commencing in or about August 2021 by, among other things, offering the generic product for sale through five compendia / price reporting services,
including First Databank, Medi-Span (Wolters Kluwer), Red Book, Gold Standard and ScriptPro. As alleged in the Motion, after Alvogen’s product
launch, certain payers began declining insurance coverage for the Company’s brand BELBUCA and directing use of Alvogen’s generic substitute
and/or made it more difficult for patients to obtain insurance coverage for BELBUCA, and thereby damaged the Company. In addition to filing the
Motion, the Company demanded that Alvogen withdraw its compendia listings. Alvogen claims to have withdrawn its compendia product listings on
or about September 9, 2021.
On December 20, 2021, the Court issued an opinion upholding the validity of claims in BDSI’s ‘866 patent, which expires in 2027, and claims in the
’539 patent, which expires in 2032. Alvogen conceded infringement of those claims prior to the trial. The Court entered final judgment on January
21, 2022. Alvogen has filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit seeking to reverse the Court’s final judgment entered on January 21, 2022.
Separately, Alvogen filed a motion to stay certain provisions of the final judgment in the Court. BDSI has filed a cross-appeal to the Federal Circuit
seeking to reverse the Court’s opinion that claims 3 and 10 of the ’866 patent and claims 8, 9 and 20 of the ’843 patent are invalid and thus Alvogen
is not liable for infringement of those claims, as well as any other ruling decided adversely to BDSI. BDSI also filed its opposition to Alvogen’s request
for a stay. The Court retained jurisdiction to decide the Company’s pending motion for contempt.
The final judgment entered in this case upholding the validity of claims of the ’866 and ’539 Orange Book listed patents extends the effective date of
any final approval by the FDA of Alvogen’s ANDA until December 21, 2032, which is the expiration date of the ’539 patent, and enjoins Alvogen and
those acting in concert with Alvogen from commercially manufacturing, using, selling, or offering for sale Alvogen’s ANDA products from until
December 21, 2032.
2018 Arkansas Opioid Litigation
On March 15, 2018, the State of Arkansas, and certain counties and cities in that State, filed an action in the Circuit Court of Arkansas, Crittenden
County against multiple manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and prescribers of opioid analgesics, including the Company. The Company was
served with the complaint on April 27, 2018. The complaint specifically alleged that it licensed its branded fentanyl buccal soluble film ONSOLIS to
Collegium, and Collegium is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. ONSOLIS is not presently sold in the United States and the license agreement
with Collegium was terminated prior to Collegium launching ONSOLIS in the United States. Therefore, on June 28, 2018, the Company moved to
dismiss the case against it and most recently, on July 6, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a notice to voluntarily dismiss us from the Arkansas case, without
prejudice.
Chemo Research, S.L
On March 1, 2019, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement in Delaware against Chemo Research, S.L., Insud Pharma S.L., IntelGenx
Corp., and IntelGenx Technologies Corp. (collectively, the “Chemo Defendants”), asserting that the Chemo Defendants infringe its Orange Book
listed patents for BELBUCA, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,147,866 and 9,655,843, both expiring in July of 2027, and U.S. Patent No. 9,901,539 expiring
December of 2032. This complaint follows a receipt by the Company on January 31, 2019, of a Notice Letter from Chemo Research S.L. stating that it
has filed with the FDA an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Patent Certification, for a generic version of BELBUCA Buccal Film in strengths 75 mcg,
150 mcg, 300 mcg, 450 mcg, and 900 mcg. Because the Company initiated a patent infringement suit to defend the patents identified in the Notice
Letter within 45 days after receipt, the FDA is prevented from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months or a decision in the case that each
of the patents is not infringed or invalid. Chemo Research S.L.’s Notice Letter also does not provide any information on the timing or approval status
of its ANDA. On March 15, 2019, the Company filed a complaint against the Defendants in New Jersey asserting the same claims for patent
infringement made in the Delaware lawsuit. On April 19, 2019, Defendants filed an answer to the Delaware complaint wherein they denied
infringement of the ‘866, ‘843 and ‘539 patents and asserted counterclaims seeking declaratory relief concerning the alleged invalidity and non-
infringement of such patents.
On April 25, 2019, the Company voluntarily dismissed the New Jersey lawsuit given Defendants’ consent to jurisdiction in Delaware.

The Bench Trial to adjudicate issues concerning the validity of the Orange Book listed patents covering BELBUCA was held on March 1, 2021. Chemo
did not participate in the bench trial. Instead, on February 26, 2021, Chemo agreed to be bound by the decision of the Court with respect to the
validity of the BEMA patents from the March 1, 2021 trial with Alvogen. On December 20, 2021, the Court issued an opinion upholding the validity of
claims in BDSI’s ‘866 patent, which expires in 2027, and claims in the ’539 patent, which expires in 2032, to which Chemo is bound. The bench trial
to adjudicate issues concerning the Chemo Defendants’ infringement of the Orange Book patents to commence on April 25, 2022.
The Company believes that it will be able to prevail in this lawsuit. As it has done in the past, the Company intends to vigorously defend its
intellectual property against assertions of invalidity or non-infringement.
Derivative Litigation
On July 2, 2018, the Company filed a Schedule 14A Proxy Statement (the “Proxy”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in
connection with its 2018 Annual Meeting. Proposals 1 and 2 of the Proxy sought stockholder approval to amend the Company’s Certificate of
Incorporation by deleting Article TWELFTH of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety and replacing it with a new Article TWELFTH
that, among other things (i) provided for the declassification of the Company’s Board in phases, with the full declassification to be achieved in 2020
(the “Declassification Amendment”) and (ii) changed the voting standard for the uncontested election of directors to the Board from a plurality
standard to the majority of votes cast standard as set forth in the bylaws of the Company (the “Election Amendment” and together with the
“Declassification Amendment”, the “Amendments”).
On August 2, 2018, the Company held the 2018 Annual Meeting, at which time the stockholders voted on the Amendments. Following the 2018
Annual Meeting, based on consultation with the Company’s advisors, the Company determined that the Amendments had been adopted by the
requisite vote of stockholders and effected the Amendments by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 6, 2018.
On September 11, 2019, two purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action against the Company and our directors in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Drachman v. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 2019-0728-AGB (Del. Ch.) (the
“Complaint”). The Complaint alleged that the Amendments did not receive the requisite vote of stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting and
asserted claims for violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law, breach of fiduciary duties, and declaratory judgment. The Complaint sought,
inter alia, a declaration that the Amendments were not validly approved and invalidation of the Amendments, including altering the one-year terms
of all directors duly elected at the 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings to three-year terms. The Complaint also sought costs and disbursements,
including attorneys’ fees. On July 1, 2020, the Company filed their response to the Complaint and denied the claims asserted therein.
On November 5, 2019, the Board determined that ratifying the declassification of the Board and the change in the voting standard as set forth in the
Amendments, as well as ratifying the filing and effectiveness of the Amendments, is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The
Board thus approved resolutions ratifying such acts and the filing and effectiveness of the Amendments under Section 204 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. On July 23, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved the ratification of the declassification of the Board and the change in
the voting standard as set forth in the Amendments as well as the filing and effectiveness of the Amendments. On July 23, 2020, the Company filed a
Certificate of Validation with the Delaware Secretary of State.
On October 8, 2020, the Court entered an agreed-to order dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims for violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law. On
October 13, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, asserting individual, class and derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duties against our
directors. On October 26, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On February 19, 2021, plaintiffs filed their
opposition to the motion to dismiss. On March 8, 2021, the defendants filed a reply in further support of the motion to dismiss. On June 23, 2021, the
Court issued an order granting defendants’ partial motion to dismiss in part and ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on a remaining
claim. On October 29, 2021, following the submission of supplemental briefing by both parties, the Court entered an order denying the remainder of
defendants’ partial motion to dismiss. On November 18, 2021, the defendants filed their answer to the amended complaint. On February 7, 2022,
the parties executed and filed with the Court a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release. The settlement is subject to the
Court’s approval and approval hearing is scheduled for June 2, 2022.

Merger Litigation
On February 25, 2022, in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the
“Transaction’), a purported individual stockholder of the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, captioned Stein v. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01600, naming as defendants the Company and each
member of the Company Board as of the date of the Merger Agreement (“Stein”). On February 28, 2022, two additional cases were filed by
purported individual shareholders of BDSI in the same court, captioned Sanford v. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-01676
(Sanford), and Higley v. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., et al., No. 1:22-cv-01658 (Higley). On March 2, 2022 and March 5, 2022, two
additional cases were filed by purported individual shareholders of the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York, captioned Justice II v. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-01145 (“Justice”) and Zomber v. BioDelivery Sciences
International, Inc., et al., 1:22-cv-01220 ("Zomber"). The Stein, Sanford, Higley, Justice, Zomber and any similar subsequently filed cases involving
the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof and/or any of the Company’s directors or officers relating directly or indirectly to the
Merger Agreement, the Transaction or any related transaction, are referred to as the “Transaction Litigations.”
The Transaction Litigations filed to date generally allege that the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the “Schedule 14D-9”)
filed by BDSI with the SEC on February 18, 2022 in connection with the Transaction is materially incomplete and misleading by allegedly failing to
disclose purportedly material information relating to the sale process leading to the Transaction, the Company’s financial projections, and the
analyses performed by Moelis & Company LLC in connection with the Transaction. The Transaction Litigations assert violations of Section 14(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Company Board.
Additionally, the Stein, Higley, Justice, and Zomber complaints assert violations of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14d-9 promulgated
thereunder. The Transaction Litigations seek, among other things: an injunction enjoining consummation of the Transaction, rescission of the Merger
Agreement, a declaration that the Company and the Company Board violated Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, damages, costs of the action, including plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees and expenses, and any other relief the
court may deem just and proper.
In addition, on February 24, 2022 and February 28, 2022, and March 7, 2022 the Company received demand letters from three purported BDSI
stockholders seeking to inspect certain books and records of the Company related to the Merger (the “Inspection Letters”) On March 4, 2022, the
Company received a demand letter from a purported BDSI stockholder alleging that the 14D-9 omits purportedly material information relating to the
Transaction (the "Demand Letter")..
BDSI cannot predict the outcome of the Transaction Litigations, Inspection Letters or Demand Letter, nor can BDSI predict the amount of time and
expense that will be required to resolve each. BDSI believes that the Transaction Litigations, Inspection Letters and Demand Letter are without merit
and intends to vigorously defend against each, and any subsequently filed similar actions.
Bankruptcy Matter
On February 3, 2022, Advisory Trust Group, LLC as trustee of the RDC Liquidating Trust, successor in interest to Rochester Drug Co‑Operative, Inc.,
filed a complaint against the Company in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of New York pursuant to Section 547 and 550
of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The plaintiff seeks to avoid and recover certain allegedly preferential payments in the aggregate amount of
$45,186.90 that the Company allegedly received prior to the bankruptcy filing of Rochester Drug Co‑Operative, Inc. The Company intends to defend
against the lawsuit.

15. Subsequent Events:
Merger Agreement
On February 14, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., a
Virginia corporation (“Collegium”), and Bristol Acquisition Company Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Collegium
(“Purchaser”).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 10
business days after the date of the Merger Agreement), Purchaser will commence a cash tender offer (the “Offer”), to acquire all of the outstanding
shares (the “Shares”) of BDSI’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “BDSI Common Stock”), at an offer price of $5.60 per Share in cash,
subject to applicable withholding taxes and without interest (the “Offer Price”). The Offer will initially remain open for 20 business days from the
date of commencement of the Offer, subject to extension under certain circumstances.
The obligation of Purchaser to purchase Shares tendered in the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,
including, but not limited to, that (i) at least one Share more than 50% of the total number of Shares of BDSI Common Stock issued and outstanding
have been validly tendered into and not validly withdrawn from the Offer and (ii) the waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, have expired
or been terminated. Neither the completion of the Offer nor the closing of the Merger are subject to a financing condition.
Following the completion of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will
merge with and into BDSI, with BDSI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Collegium (the “Merger”). The Merger shall be governed by and
effected under Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), with no stockholder vote required to consummate the Merger.
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the Shares then outstanding (other than Shares held by (i) BDSI or its subsidiaries
(including Shares held in BDSI’s treasury), (ii) Collegium, Purchaser, any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Collegium, or (iii)
stockholders of BDSI who have properly exercised and perfected their statutory rights of appraisal under the DGCL) will each be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price.
The board of directors of BDSI (the “BDSI Board”) has unanimously (i) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger (the “Transactions”), (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Transactions, are in the best interests of BDSI and its stockholders, (iii) resolved that the Merger shall be governed by and
effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of BDSI accept the Offer and tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.
The Merger Agreement provides that each stock option to purchase shares of BDSI Common Stock (a “BDSI Option”) that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable effective immediately prior to, and
contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each BDSI Option with a per share exercise price less than the Offer Price that is then
outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such BDSI Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price payable per Share under
such BDSI Option, net of applicable withholding taxes. Each BDSI Option with an exercise price equal to, or greater than, the Offer Price that is then
outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled without any consideration paid therefor whether before or after the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement also provides that each restricted stock unit award issued by BDSI (a “BDSI RSU”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically accelerate and become fully vested immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time, each BDSI RSU that is then outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement of such BDSI RSU multiplied by (y) the Offer Price.
The Merger Agreement further provides that, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of BDSI Common Stock (a “BDSI
Warrant”) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price less than the Offer Price shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
