Company shall file similar Super 10-K reports for the fiscal year ending, June 30, 2021. The Company became
delinquent in its filings primarily due to financial circumstances directly related to the failure of its core operating
business. Since fiscal year ending June 30, 2014 until the date of this filing, the Company has not maintained an
operating business from which it could draw the financial resources to retain and compensate the required
professionals needed to maintain compliance. Each Super 10-K for a given fiscal year contains all required

since June 30, 2014 through the filing date of this annual report.
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND
We were incorporated on January 16, 2008 under the laws of the state of Nevada as Plethora Resources Inc. to commence
operations in the business of consulting to oil & gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production
licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in Russia. We were unable to fund our intended business and, on May 28, 2009, but
effective February 1, 2009, we acquired a wholly owned subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd, for the assumption of the debts of
Sync2 Agency Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sync2 International Ltd. Sync2 Agency Ltd is an internet marketing and website
development company.
On May 14, 2009 we changed our name to Sync2 Networks Corp. On December 15, 2009, we shut down the operations of Sync2
Agency Ltd. after incurring substantial operating losses, and subsequently wrote-off the investment in Sync2 Agency Ltd.
At the end of 2009 Sync2 International Ltd, became inactive and Sync2 Agency Ltd. was liquidated.
Prior Business Operations
We were previously engaged in the business of acquiring and developing internet marketing and web site development entities
and/or their individual software programs designed to enable third-party clients to better market their products through the use
of the internet.
2013 Change in Control
On approximately August 14, 2013, there was a change in our control. In accordance with the terms and provisions of that
certain escrow agreement dated March 31, 2012 (the “2012 Escrow Agreement”), Warren Gilbert, who was at the time the
current President/Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer/Chief Financial Officer and sole member of the Board of
Directors, acquired in a private transaction an aggregate of 62,863,800 shares of our restricted common stock representing an
equity interest of 61% of the total issued and outstanding shares. The amount of consideration paid was $325,000 and were
outside funds from unrelated parties. The shares of common stock were acquired as follows: (i) 51,000,000 shares from Artur
Etozov; and (ii) 11,863,800 shares from approximately ten separate shareholders each holding less than 5% of the total issued
and outstanding.

Domestication of Subsidiary
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our
subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of
the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”). Under Nevada statutory law, involves the transfer of an existing corporation from one
jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014, we filed Articles of
Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a corporate entity
formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as domesticated in the
State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta. As part of the process of
domestication of Sync 2 International Ltd, we recognized $516,245 of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from
the write off of the remaining assets and liabilities of Sync 2 International Ltd.
Sync2 International Ltd. entity status has been revoked by the Nevada Secretary of State as of the date of this filing.
FINRA Corporate Action/Information Statement on Form 14C
On October 9, 2013, our Board of Directors and majority shareholders approved a reverse stock split of one for one thousand
(1:1000) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and a change in our name from
“Sync2 Networks Corp.” to “TREX Acquisition Corp.” (the “Name Change”). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised
Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of the Company’s outstanding votes was required to effectuate the Reverse
Stock Split and the Name Change. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of
October 9, 2013, we had 103,046,175 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the
shares of common stock were entitled to 62,863,800 votes, which represented approximately 61.0% of the voting rights
associated with our shares of common stock at that time. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split
and the Name Change described herein in a unanimous written consent dated October 9, 2013. An information statement on
Form 14(c) was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 11, 2013.
On December 11, 2013, we filed an Information Statement on Form 14(c) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
was furnished to all holders of our common stock as of October 9, 2013, in connection with the action taken by written consent of
holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company to authorize the following: (i) ratification of an amendment
to the articles of incorporation (the “Name Change Amendment”) to effectuate the Name Change and (ii) ratification of the
Reverse Stock Split.
Warren Gilbert was the shareholder of record who held in the aggregate a majority of our total issued and outstanding common
stock and who signed the written consent of stockholders. Prior to the Reverse Stock Split, Warren Gilbert was the holder of
record of 62,863,800 shares of common stock, which was 61% of the outstanding voting power of the Company at that time.
The Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Reverse Stock Split including, but not
limited to: (i) current trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTC QB Market and potential to increase the
marketability and liquidity of our common stock; (ii) possible reluctance of brokerage firms and institutional investors to
recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients or to hold in their own portfolios; (iii) desire to meet future requirements of per-
share price and net tangible assets and shareholders’ equity relating to admission for trading on other markets; and (iv)
posturing us and our structure in favorable position in order to effectively negotiate with potential acquisition candidates
regarding assets. Our Board of Directors approved the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split and recommended our
majority shareholders review and approve the Name Change and the Reverse Stock Split.
The Reverse Stock Split was effectuated based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Reverse Stock
Split decreased our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 103,046,175 shares to 103,046
shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be $0.001 par value. Our trading symbol changed to “TRXA”. After
the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change, the CUSIP number for the Company became 89532J 108. All subsequent common
stock references in this filing are post-Reverse Stock Split figures, unless otherwise identified.

The Name Change was effectuated to better reflect our future business goal to acquire an operating business via merger or
acquisition.
2014 Change of Control
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and to date, we did not issue any shares of common stock other than shares issued for
debt conversion as discussed below.
During 2010, we had received monies from Boardwalk Business Developments Inc. (“Boardwalk”) pursuant to an operating loan
and other advances made by Boardwalk to us. Therefore, we evidenced the monies loaned by that certain convertible debenture
dated June 30, 2010 (the “Convertible Debenture”), which Convertible Debenture was and has been evidenced on our audited
financial statements. Subsequently, Boardwalk and certain assignees (each an “Assignee” and collectively, the “Assignees”)
entered into those certain assignments of convertible debenture dated July 15, 2012 (the “Assignments”) pursuant to which
Boardwalk assigned and transferred to each of the Assignees a portion of its right, title and interest in and to the Debenture for
payment of consideration from each of $8,000. The Assignees further assigned portions of their respective debt to others for
consideration. We received those certain conversion notices dated September 21, 2014 from certain of the Assignees and others
(collectively, the “Conversion Notices”) and desired to settle the debt evidenced by the Convertible Debenture in the aggregate
amount of $691,926.00 by conversion into an aggregate post-Reverse Stock Split 1,835,835 shares of our restricted common
stock at $0.3769 (which conversion price was changed based on the 1:1000 reverse stock split). Therefore, effective on
September 21, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of an aggregate 1,835,835 shares of our restricted common
stock to the Assignees and others in accordance with the terms and provisions of the respective Conversion Notices. The shares
of common stock were issued at $0.3769 per share. The shares of common stock were issued to United States residents in
reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state
securities laws and may not be offered or sold without registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. The Assignees and others acknowledged that the securities to be
issued have not been registered under the Securities Act, that they understood the economic risk of an investment in the
securities, and that they had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from our management concerning any and
all matters related to acquisition of the securities.
The shares related to the Boardwalk Convertible Debenture were issued by the Company on November 16, 2020. No Assignee or
other subsequent assignee holds in the aggregate shares exceeding 4.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common
stock. As of September 21, 2014, Mr. Warren Gilbert is no longer the controlling shareholder of the Company.
CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 , the Company did not have any material business operations. From the period covered
in this filing until the date of this filing, the Company has not had any material business operations.
2014 Failed Prospective Kerr Utility Technologies Inc. Reverse Merger Transaction
On May 30, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the execution of a non-binding Letter of Intent in the form of a Term Sheet
(the “2014 Term Sheet”) with Kerr Utility Technologies Inc. (“Kerr”) regarding a prospective tax-free reverse merger transaction
with Kerr. In connection with this prospective reverse merger, we had intended to incorporate and establish two wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company to facilitate the Kerr acquisition (collectively, the “Merger Vehicles”). At that time, our Board of
Directors also approved a private placement to raise, on an “all or none” basis, an aggregate sum of $500,000 for Kerr’s benefit
prior to consummation of the Kerr acquisition.

Table of Contents
In July 2014, in anticipation of the closing of the reverse merger transaction, a related party advanced, on behalf of the
Company, $100,000 to Kerr (the “July 2014 Advance”). The July 2014 Advance is in addition to the $100,000 advanced by the
same related party in May 2014 (the “May 2014 Advance”). The Kerr acquisition was ultimately not concluded, and the Company
could not recover the $200,000 in funds reflected in the May 2014 Advance and the July 2014 Advance. As a result, the Company
had written-off both advances totaling $200,000 ($100,000 in the year ending June 30, 2014 and $100,000 during the quarter
ended September 30, 2015); specifically accounting for the May 2014 Advance during the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30,
2014 and the July 2014 Advance during the Company’s quarter ended September 30, 2015.
As of September 30, 2015, the 2014 Term Sheet with Kerr is no longer in effect, no Merger Vehicles had been established, and
the Kerr acquisition was never consummated.
2018 Failed Reverse Merger Attempt
On April 19, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding indication of interest (“LOI”) to acquire Kaneptec Enterprises, Inc., a
company engaged in the hemp and cannabidiol business (“Kaneptec”) in a reverse merger (the “Kaneptec Transaction”). In
reliance of the LOI, the Company sold 350,000 shares to a related party for $47,500, and this cash was transferred to Kaneptec
in order to facilitate the Kaneptec Transaction. This potential merger candidate also advanced approximately $20,000 to the
Company in anticipation of the Kaneptec Transaction. During the due diligence phase, the Company’s consultants determined
that Kaneptec had made material misrepresentations; therefore, the Company ceased all further negotiations with Kaneptec. The
Company has not recovered any sums advanced to Kaneptec in contemplation of the failed Kaneptec Transaction.
2020 and 2021 Stock Issuances

PENNY STOCK REGULATION
Shares of our common stock will probably be subject to rules adopted the SEC that regulate broker-dealer practices in
connection with transactions in “penny stocks.” Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00
(other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that
current price and volume information with respect to transactions in those securities is provided by the exchange or system). The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver
a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which contains the following:
9

Table of Contents
· a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;
· a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
with respect to violation to such duties or other requirements of securities’ laws;
· a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the
significance of the spread between the “bid” and “ask” price;
· a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;
· definitions of significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and
· such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format), as the SEC shall require by rule or
regulation.
Prior to effecting any transaction in penny stock, the broker-dealer also must provide the customer the following:
· the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;
· the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;
· the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and
liquidity of the market for such stock; and
· monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.
In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to
transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure
requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to
the penny stock rules. Holders of shares of our common stock may have difficulty selling those shares because our common stock
will probably be subject to the penny stock rules.
TRANSFER AGENT
The stock transfer agent for our securities is Corporate Stock Transfer, 3200 Cherry Creek South Drive, Denver, Colorado

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should

GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 financial statements contains an
explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and
have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following describes the recently issued accounting standards used in reporting our financial condition and results of
operations. In some cases, accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. Such is the
case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be
different should we employ an alternative accounting method.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would
have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Trex Acquisitions Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trex Acquisitions Corp. (“the Company”) as of June 30, 2020
and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has not commenced operations or generated revenue to date.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.

TREX ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2020
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TREX Acquisition Corp. (The “Company”) was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora
Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of
consulting to oil and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and
gas properties in Russia. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp when the Company began to engage in
software-related services. On March 20, 2014 to TREX Acquisition Corp. after the Company business operations had ceased.
As of June 30, 2020, the Company consists of itself and its 100% owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd.
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our
subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of
the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation
from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014,
we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a
corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as
domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta.
The Company’s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance
and management company.
2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc.
On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Merger Sub”) in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The
Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this
filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to
acquire a company. The Company’s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and
maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are
recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which
present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being
presented
F-7

Table of Contents
Determination of Bad Debts
The Company’s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether
any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt
expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the e allowance for doubtful accounts.
Principles of Consolidation
The accounts include those of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities.
On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Merger Sub”) in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The
Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this
filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to
acquire a company. The Company’s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of
its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-
37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures,
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such
instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar
financial arrangements at June 30, 2020.
F-8

Table of Contents
The assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet approximate their fair value.
Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account
their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or
retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in statements of operations.
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period.
The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07—Compensation—
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since June
30, 2020 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).
The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will
collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five
steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
· Identify the contract with the customer
· Identify the performance obligations in the contract
· Determine the transaction price
· Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
· Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation
Income taxes
Federal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception.
On December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant
changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”)
from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2020
using a Federal Tax Rate of 21%.
F-9

Table of Contents
Income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 Income Taxes –
Recognition. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation
allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than
not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.
Deferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.
As of June 30, 2020, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(2,398,616) and a deferred tax asset of
$503,709 using the statutory rate of 21%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years.
However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of $(503,709). FASB ASC 740 prescribes
recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At June 30, 2020, the Company had not taken any tax
positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.

Deferred Tax Asset $ 503,709 $ 485,319

Deferred Tax Asset (Net) $ - $ -
Due to the changes the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to additional limitations. Should certain changes in ownership occur, our net
operating loss carryforwards may be limited to use in future years. In addition, tax rates on corporations were reduced and
certain other deductions limited. These changes may affect the income tax benefit calculation and related allowance during
subsequent fiscal years
Net income (loss) per common share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during
the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes
that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
There were 1,835,835 potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of June 30, 2020 resulting from shares to be issued per the
conversion of related party debt (see Note 4). We also had 450,000 in shares to be issued for services that were unissued at June
30, 2020. We also had outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of June 30, 2020. At the
end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Cash flows reporting
The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting,
classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and
provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph
230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net
income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash
receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are
included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency
equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of
exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not
resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.

Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for
all periods.
Subsequent events
The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of
subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial
statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,398,616 and a working
capital deficit of $476,843 as of June 30, 2020.
While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be
significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public
or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and
generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the
viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect
and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
revenues.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

2018 Failed Reverse Merger Attempt
On April 19, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding indication of interest (“LOI”) to acquire Kaneptec Enterprises, Inc., a
company engaged in the hemp and cannabidiol business (“Kaneptec”) in a reverse merger (the “Kaneptec Transaction”). In
reliance of the LOI, the Company sold 350,000 shares to a related party for $47,500, and this cash was transferred to Kaneptec
in order to facilitate the Kaneptec Transaction. This potential merger candidate also advanced approximately $20,000 to the
Company in anticipation of the Kaneptec Transaction. During the due diligence phase, the Company’s consultants discovered
that Kaneptec’s management had made material misrepresentations regarding its business and management; therefore, the
Company ceased all further negotiations with Kaneptec. The Company has not recovered any sums advanced to Kaneptec in
contemplation of the failed Kaneptec Transaction.
Free office space

TREX ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
September 30, 2019
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TREX Acquisition Corp. (The “Company”) was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora
Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on
March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil
and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in
Russia.
The Company consists of itself and its 100% owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd.
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our
subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of
the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation
from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014,
we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a
corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as
domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta.
The Company’s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance
and management company.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal
year end June 30, 2019, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.”
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and
maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are
recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which
present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being
presented
Determination of Bad Debts
The Company’s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether
any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt
expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts.
F-20

Table of Contents
Principles of Consolidation
The accounts include those of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of
its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-
37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures,
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximates the fair value of such
instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar
financial arrangements at September 30, 2019.
The assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet approximate their fair value.
Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account
their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or
retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in statements of operations.
F-21

Table of Contents
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The
Company’s long-lived assets, which includes computer equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows
associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their
respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those
assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily
determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives
are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined
remaining estimated useful lives.
The Company determined that there were no impairments of long-lived assets as of September 30, 2019 or June 30, 2019
Stock based compensations
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period.
The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07—Compensation—
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since
September 30, 2019 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).
The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will
collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five
steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
· Identify the contract with the customer
· Identify the performance obligations in the contract
· Determine the transaction price
· Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
· Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

Net income (loss) per common share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during
the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes
that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
There were 1,835,835 potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of September 30, 2019 resulting from shares to be issued per
the conversion of related party debt (see Note 4). We also had 450,000 shares to be issued for consulting that were unissued as
of September 30, 2019. We also had outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of
September 30, 2019. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been
anti-dilutive.
Cash flows reporting
The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting,
classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and
provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph
230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net
income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash
receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are
included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency
equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of
exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not
resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for
all periods.
Subsequent events
The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of
subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial
statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,337,657 and a working
capital deficit of $426,384 as of September 30, 2019.
While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be
significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public
or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and
generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the
viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect
and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
revenues.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.

TREX ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
December 31, 2019
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TREX Acquisition Corp. (The “Company”) was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora
Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on
March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil
and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in
Russia.
The Company consists of itself and its 100% owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd.
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our
subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of
the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation
from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014,
we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a
corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as
domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta.
The Company’s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance
and management company.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal
year end June 30, 2019, as filed with this form 10K.”
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and
maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are
recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which
present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being
presented
Determination of Bad Debts
The Company’s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether
any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt
expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Principles of Consolidation
The accounts include those of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
F-32

Table of Contents
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of
its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-
37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures,
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such
instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar
financial arrangements at December 31, 2019.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis.
Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account
their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or
retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in statements of operations.
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period.
The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07—Compensation—
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since
December 31, 2019 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed.
F-33

Table of Contents
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).
The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will
collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five
steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
· Identify the contract with the customer
· Identify the performance obligations in the contract
· Determine the transaction price
· Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
· Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation
Net income (loss) per common share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during
the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes
that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
There were 1,835,835 potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 resulting from shares to be issued per the
conversion of related party debt (see Note 4). We also had 450,000 of shares to be issued for consulting that were unissued as of
December 31, 2019. We also had outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of December
31, 2019. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-
dilutive.
Cash flows reporting
The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting,
classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and
provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph
230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net
income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash
receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are
included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency
equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of
exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not
resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for
all periods.
Subsequent events
The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of
subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial
statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.

NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,364,938 and a working
capital deficit of $443,165 at December 31, 2019.
While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be
significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public
or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and
generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the
viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect
and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
revenues.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

TREX ACQUISITION CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
March 31, 2020
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TREX Acquisition Corp. (The “Company”) was formed on January 16, 2008 in the state of Nevada under the name Plethora
Resources, Inc. as a development stage enterprise. The Company later changed its name to Sync2 Networks Corp. then on
March 20, 2014 to T-REX Acquisition Corp. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of consulting to oil
and gas exploration companies interested in obtaining exploration and production licenses at auction for oil and gas properties in
Russia.
The Company consists of itself and its 100% owned subsidiary Sync2 Networks International Ltd.
On April 7, 2014, our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to domesticate our
subsidiary, Sync2 International Ltd., as a corporation formed under the laws of Malta to a corporation formed under the laws of
the State of Nevada (the “Domestication”), which under Nevada statutory law involves the transfer of an existing corporation
from one jurisdiction to another whereby Sync2 Networks International Ltd. shall cease all operations in Malta. On May 1, 2014,
we filed Articles of Domestication with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting the domestication of Sync2 International Ltd. as a
corporate entity formed under the laws of the State of Nevada, which domestication provides that Sync2 International Ltd. as
domesticated in the State of Nevada shall be the same entity as Sync2 International Ltd. organized under the laws of Malta.
The Company’s business plan is to find a merger candidate and become an operating company or to be a corporate governance
and management company.
2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc.
On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Merger Sub”) in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The
Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this
filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to
acquire a company. The Company’s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted account principles have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with a reading of the financial statements and notes there included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal
year end June 30, 2019, as filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.”
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and
maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company’s system of internal
accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are
recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which
present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being
presented
F-44

Table of Contents
Determination of Bad Debts
The Company’s policy is to analyze the collectability of Accounts and Notes Receivable on a monthly basis to determine whether
any allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Once the allowance has been determined the offset is booked to bad debt
expense and subsequently if the account is deemed to be a bad debt, it is written off the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Principles of Consolidation
The accounts include those of the Company and its 100% owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
At this time, SYNC2 International LTD has no operations, assets or liabilities.
2020 TRXA Merger Sub Inc.
On March 13, 2020, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, TRXA Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Merger Sub”) in order to facilitate the acquisition of a pre-revenue Software-as-a-Service internet platform business. The
Company’s sole Officer and Director currently serves as the sole officer and director of the Merger Sub. As of the date of this
filing, neither the Company nor the Merger Sub have entered into a definitive agreement or non-binding letter of intent to
acquire a company. The Company’s Acquisition Consultants continue to provide vetted candidates for merger with the Company.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of
its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-
37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) GAAP, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures,
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value
hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
F-45

Table of Contents
The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such
instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar
financial arrangements at March 31, 2020.
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis.
Equipment
Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation of equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account
their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or
retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in statements of operations.
Stock based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Section 718 Compensation – Stock Compensation.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718 stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
value of the award and is recognized as expensed ratably over the requisite service period/vesting period.
The company accounts for its non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Update 2018-07—Compensation—
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
Commitments and contingencies
The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Since
March 31, 2020 and through the date of filing, there have been no intervening lawsuits, claims or judgments filed.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, ”Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” (“ASC 606”).
The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will
collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. The following five
steps are applied to achieve that core principle:
· Identify the contract with the customer
· Identify the performance obligations in the contract
· Determine the transaction price
· Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
· Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

Table of Contents
Net income (loss) per common share
Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during
the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes
that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.
There were 1,835,835 potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020 resulting from shares to be issued per the
conversion of related party debt (see Note 4). We also had 450,000 of shares to be issued for compensation that were unissued
as of March 31, 2020. We also had outstanding warrants that could convert into 187,500 shares of common stock as of March 31,
2020. At the end of both periods the potentially dilutive shares were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Cash flows reporting
The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting,
classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and
provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph
230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net
income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash
receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are
included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency
equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of
exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not
resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were zero for
all periods.
Subsequent events
The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of
subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued.
Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer, considers its financial
statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.
NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $2,382,942 and a working
capital deficit of $443,165 as of March 31, 2020.
While the Company is attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, the Company’s cash position may not be
significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public
or private offering. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and
generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the
viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect
and there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan and generate
revenues.
F-47

Table of Contents
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.

ITEM 9. CHANGES AND DISAGREEMENT WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
As of the date of this filing, there are no disagreements between us and our accountants on any matter of accounting principles,
practices or financial statement disclosure.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. Based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures performed as of the end of the periods covered by this
report, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.
MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
· Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets;
· Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and
· Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 1992 Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“2013 COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer believe that, as of June 30, 2020, our
internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following:
18

Table of Contents
· Deficiencies in Segregation of Duties. Lack of proper segregation of functions, duties and responsibilities with respect to
our cash and control over the disbursements related thereto due to our very limited staff, including our accounting
personnel. Deficiencies in the staffing of our financial accounting department. The number of qualified accounting
personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to
maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine
and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused,
or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.
In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes
as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that
(1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material face necessary to make the
statements made not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows for the years and periods then ended.
This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the
rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this report.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended
June 30, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Table of Contents
Mr. Horkey earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Florida Atlantic University and has been certified by the State of
Florida as a Certified Public Accountant since April 1979. He is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants as well as the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He also holds the designation as Certified in Florida
Sales Tax, a specialty designation awarded jointly by the Florida Board of Accountancy and the Florida Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
Mr. Horkey is also a 1993 graduate of Leadership Broward and 1987 President of the Sunrise Chamber of Commerce. He has
been a member of the Broward Workforce Development Board since 1993 and Chair of its Audit Committee and was Board Chair
for 2015-2016. Mr. Horkey is the 1995 recipient of the “Small Business Person of the Year” award from the Sunrise Chamber of
Commerce, and a two-time finalist for the South Florida “Up and Comers” Award in accounting. He was also Chair of the Sole
Practitioners Committee of the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants for two years.
Mr. Horkey’s community involvement also extends into the education environment. He was a member of the School Board of

years, and co-founder of the Sunrise Chamber “One for the Kids” Program (which matches business people who have specific

All directors hold office until the completion of their term of office, which is not longer than one year, or until their successors
have been elected. All officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and, subject to employment agreements (which
do not currently exist), serve at the discretion of the board. Currently, our directors receive no compensation.
There is no family relationship between any of our officers or directors. For the past ten years, there have been no orders,
judgments, or decrees of any governmental agency or administrator, or of any court of competent jurisdiction, revoking or
suspending for cause any license, permit or other authority to engage in the securities business or in the sale of a particular
security or temporarily or permanently restraining any of our officers or directors from engaging in or continuing any conduct,
practice or employment in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, or convicting such person of any felony or
misdemeanor involving a security, or any aspect of the securities business or of theft or of any felony.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Committees
Our Board of Directors does not currently have a compensation committee or nominating and corporate governance committee
because, due to the Board of Director’s composition and our relatively limited operations, the Board of Directors believes it is
able to effectively manage the issues normally considered by such committees. Our Board of Directors may undertake a review of
the need for these committees in the future.
Audit Committee and Financial Expert
Our Board of Directors has not established an audit committee. The respective role of an audit committee has been conducted by
our Board of Directors. We intend to establish an audit committee as soon as it is practical to do so.. When established, the audit
committee’s primary function will be to provide advice with respect to our financial matters and to assist our Board of Directors
in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance. The audit committee’s primary
duties and responsibilities will be to: (i) serve as an independent and objective party to monitor our financial reporting process
and internal control system; (ii) review and appraise the audit efforts of our independent accountants; (iii) evaluate our quarterly
financial performance as well as its compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) oversee management’s establishment and
enforcement of financial policies and business practices; and (v) provide an open avenue of communication among the
independent accountants, management and our Board of Directors.
