    E.g: from Jun_2023, you can ask "in the quarter of June 2023" or "in June 2023"
3. The question must use the trading ticker symbol if it is provided.
    E.g: Summarize MSTR 2023 10k earning call report
4. Please prioritize questions that ask for financial numbers.
5. Please do not generate yes/no question.
6. Always generate 5 questions, number them from 1 to 5 numerically.
